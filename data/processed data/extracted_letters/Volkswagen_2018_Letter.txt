Looking  ahead,  the  situation  remains  challenging.  The  tech-
nological  change  in  our  industry  –  from  e-mobility  through 
to digitalization, connectivity, new mobility solutions, and on 
to  automated  driving  –  is  going  to  take  a  lot  of  energy  and 
financial resources. We want to shape this development from 
the  top.  Therefore,  we  are  realigning  our  activities.  We  will 
increase  our  efficiency  and  competitiveness,  pick  up  speed 
and revise our cost structures. 
The coming years will be guided by our electric campaign. We 
are  committed  to  the  Paris  Agreement  and  to  making  our 
contribution  to  protecting  people  and  the  environment. 
We’re planning investments of around €30 billion in electric 
mobility in the next five years. Our emphasis is on the elec-
tric  car,  because  from  today’s  perspective  it  is  the  best  and 
most efficient choice for reducing CO2 in transport. By 2025, 
we will put 50 new electric models on the road. By then, every 
fourth  car  in  our  range  will  be  an  electric  model.  With  the 
Volkswagen ID., we will soon offer the first vehicle with a CO2-
neutral  supply  chain  and  production.  This  will  also  change 
the  face  of  our  plants:  Zwickau,  Emden  and  Hanover  will  be 
transformed  into  pure-play  electric  car  plants,  forming 
Europe’s  largest  electric  production  network.  In  China,  too, 
the  conversion  of  the  Anting  and  Foshan  plants  is  in  full 
swing.  The  production  launch  of  electric  cars  in  North 
America is planned for 2022. 
infotainment  to  fully  autonomous  driving:  software  will 
shape  the  car  of  tomorrow.  To  be  globally  successful,  com-
panies need economies of scale, and as a leading company in 
the  sector,  Volkswagen  has  the  necessary  size.  What  we  are 
lacking  in  many  areas  is  software  expertise.  We  are  taking 
steps to acquire these skills by forging alliances with partners, 
increasing resources at full speed, revising our structures and 
changing  our  workflows.  We  are  the  first  established  auto-
maker  to  separate  hardware  from  software  development.  At 
the Volkswagen brand, we have therefore established a sepa-
rate  Board  of  Management  position  for  software,  which  
will  additionally  be  responsible  for  the  Digital  &  Software-
Services Group division. 
We are keeping a close eye on our goal to become the global 
leading provider of sustainable mobility. This will be possible 
if  we  continue  to  improve.  We  want  to  achieve  sustainable 
growth  and  create  value.  For  our  customers.  For  our  work-
force. For our shareholders. 
I thank you for your trust and invite you to stay with us as we 
move forward on this journey. 
Sincerely, 
But the transformation of the car will go far beyond drives. It 
is becoming a highly complex, connected device, like a “tablet 
on  wheels”,  if  you  like.  From  assistance  systems  through
