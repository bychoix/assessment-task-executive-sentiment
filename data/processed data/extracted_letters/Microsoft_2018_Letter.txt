Dear shareholders, customers, partners and employees:  
As I reflect on our progress this past year, I first want to say thank you for your commitment and investment in Microsoft. 
I’m proud of what we’ve accomplished together as we innovate and help customers navigate their digital transformation, 
and I am even more optimistic about the opportunity ahead.  
We are living at a crucial time in history where the impact of technology on every part of our daily life and work and every 
aspect of our society and economy is more acute than ever before. It is incumbent upon leaders of our industry to ensure 
that  the  technology  we  build  always  creates  opportunity.  Too  often,  we  celebrate  technology  disruption  for  the  sake  of 
disruption without reflecting on its unintended consequences. What the world needs is technology that benefits people and 
society more broadly and is trusted.  
Our mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. Our business model 
is dependent on our customers’ and partners’ success. We are grounded in creating local economic opportunity in every 
community, helping to unlock the power of technology to address our customers’ most pressing challenges. Our platforms 
and tools enable creativity  in  all of us. They  help drive  small-business productivity,  large business competitiveness  and 
public-sector efficiency. They also support new startups, improve educational and health outcomes, and empower human 
ingenuity. Our sense of purpose lies in our customers’ success.  
Our culture enables us to pursue our mission with a growth mindset. It’s a continuous practice of learning, renewal and 
having the courage to confront our own fixed mindsets. Collectively, we are moving from a group of people who know it all 
to  a  group  of  people  who  want  to  learn  it  all.  To  achieve  our  mission,  we  must  reflect  the  diverse  perspectives  and 
experiences of our customers around the world. We must have a deep sense of their unmet and unarticulated needs. Each 
day we are pushing ourselves to be more customer obsessed, to be more diverse and inclusive, and to operate as One 
Microsoft – ultimately to make a bigger difference in the world.  
OPPORTUNITY AND IMPACT  
One of the greatest privileges I have as CEO of Microsoft is seeing firsthand the incredible impact our technologies have 
on  people  and  organizations  around  the  world.  Our  ecosystem  touches  the  lives  of  billions  of  people  every  single  day, 
creating new opportunity for our customers and partners and positively impacting local communities.  
In Kenya, our partner M-KOPA Solar has connected hundreds of thousands of homes across sub-Saharan Africa to solar 
power for the first time using the Microsoft Cloud, innovating with a pay-as-you-go model that helps households living on 
less than $2 a day establish a credit history. In Arizona, we are applying Dynamics 365 to improve outcomes among one of 
the state’s most vulnerable populations – the more than 15,000 children in foster care. In Poland, MedApp is using HoloLens 
to help cardiologists visualize a patient’s heart as it beats  – in real time – reducing the amount of time they then need to 
perform  open-heart  surgery.  In  Kona,  Hawaii,  Jack’s  Diving  Locker  is  using  Microsoft  365  to  connect  its  50  employees 
across land and sea so that they can focus on what they do best – protect pristine coral reefs and take people diving. In 
Washington state, Karrick Johnson, an 8-year-old with dyslexia, avoided reading in class until he started using our Learning 
Tools. And in Cambodia, underserved children in rural communities are learning to code with Minecraft, opening doors to 
futures that would have previously been unimaginable.  
Across  the  globe,  enterprise  customers  in  every  industry  –  from  iconic  brands  like  Coca-Cola  Company  and  Chevron 
Corporation to ZF Group, a car parts manufacturer in Germany – are using our technology to build their own digital capability 
so they can thrive  in a world where every company  is a  software company. Walmart  – the world’s  largest company by 
revenue, and its biggest private employer – chose Azure and Microsoft 365 to fuel its digital transformation, transforming 
the shopping experience for customers and empowering their more than 2 million associates to do their best work.

In  sum,  our  platforms  create  broad  surplus  everywhere,  from  the  farmer  who  is  able  to  apply  precision  agriculture  to 
conserve  resources and  increase  yields, to the  hospital  that  is able to  lower the cost  of healthcare and  improve patient 
outcomes, to the largest companies of the world reaching new customers in new markets.  
RESULTS AND PROGRESS  
The breadth and depth of our mission and the trust customers are placing in us to power their digital transformation enable 
us to have this broad impact – and it is fueling our results.  
In fiscal 2018, we delivered $110.4 billion in revenue and $35.1 billion in operating income and returned $21.5 billion to 
shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.  
Our commercial cloud business delivered more than $23 billion in revenue, exceeding the ambitious goal we had set to 
achieve $20 billion in annualized commercial cloud revenue by the end of fiscal 2018, nine months ahead of schedule. In 
addition, we expanded our commercial cloud gross margin to 57 percent, up 7 points year-over-year.  
These  are  strong  results  –  and  yet  the  opportunity  ahead  in  a  world  powered  by  an  intelligent  cloud  and  edge  is 
unprecedented.  Imagine  a future where all  of your apps and experiences revolve around  you and transcend any  single 
device; where data in any form is analyzed in real time so that computers can anticipate and even act on your behalf and 
augment  what  you  would  otherwise  be  able  to  accomplish  on  your  own.  And  where  computing  is  more  distributed  and 
embedded in the world, from intelligent digital assistants at work, on the go and in your home that you can communicate 
with in a myriad of ways – voice, eyes or gestures – to oil rigs that adjust production in real time as demand fluctuates in 
global markets.  
Across each of our customer solution areas, we are broadening our offerings and accelerating our innovation to capture the 
opportunities this new era will create for our customers and better meet their unarticulated needs.  
Modern Workplace  
We expanded our Microsoft 365 offerings to reach new audiences and empower more employees for the modern workplace, 
protecting data from increasingly sophisticated cybersecurity threats and delivering secure productivity and collaboration 
tools. Already a multi-billion-dollar business, Microsoft 365 gives customers a path to the cloud and broadens our reach with 
new  and  under-penetrated  markets  –  from  Fortune  500  enterprises  to  small  businesses  to  more  than  2  billion  firstline 
workers. More than 135 million people use Office 365 commercial every month, and Outlook Mobile is helping people be 
productive and stay secure on more than 100 million iOS and Android devices worldwide – with AI-infused experiences they 
use  every  day.  Microsoft  Teams  has  rapidly  become  the  hub  for  teamwork  and  is  being  used  by  more  than  300,000 
organizations of all sizes, including 87 of the Fortune 100. Windows 10 is now active on nearly 700 million devices around 
the world. And we continue to create new device categories with always-on, always-connected Windows 10 PCs and an 
expanded family of Surface devices including the new Surface Go – setting the bar for the industry.  
Business Applications  
Every process inside a business is being digitized, and we are winning customers with our differentiated approach, enabling 
organizations  of  all  sizes  to  digitize  critical  business  functions  –  from  sales  to  marketing  to  HR.  Dynamics  365  is  the 
alternative to monolithic, siloed suites of business applications with modular, extensible and AI-driven apps that are part of 
a connected data graph and unlock insights across every part of the organization. Net seats grew 52 percent year-over-
year, and our  investments  in Power BI  have made  Microsoft the  leader  in business analytics  in the cloud. Our  recently 
announced Open Data Initiative with Adobe and SAP will enable our customers to take control of their data and build new 
experiences that truly put people at the center. And we are innovating with HoloLens and mixed reality to create immersive 
experiences that digitize physical spaces and interactions to transform training, collaboration and design for firstline workers, 
who account for 80 percent of the world’s workforce.

LinkedIn is the essential platform to connect the world’s professionals and create economic opportunity for every member 
of the global workforce. LinkedIn now has more than 575 million members, and we are continuously innovating to give them 
new ways to connect and engage with one another – from increasing the relevancy of the LinkedIn Feed to a better mobile 
experience, to introducing new video and messaging capability. And we are transforming how companies manage talent, 
training, and sales and marketing  with  new solutions powered by the LinkedIn and Microsoft Graphs. Dynamics  365 for 
Talent with LinkedIn Recruiter and Learning gives HR professionals a complete solution in an increasingly competitive talent 
marketplace, and deep integration of LinkedIn Sales Navigator and Dynamics 365 redefines social selling, enabling sales 
professionals to dramatically increase their effectiveness by drawing on the relationships in their personal networks. We will 
continue to innovate across the LinkedIn platform to add new value for members and customers.  
Applications and Infrastructure  
To thrive in the era of the intelligent cloud and intelligent edge, customers need a consistent computing stack from the cloud 
to the edge. Azure is the only hyperscale cloud that extends to the edge across identity, data, application platform, and 
security and management – and this architectural advantage is increasingly clear to our customers. Azure revenue grew 91 
percent year-over-year.  
And we are investing aggressively to build Azure as the world’s computer. We expanded our global datacenter footprint to 
54 regions – more than any other cloud provider – and with the most comprehensive compliance coverage in the industry 
to meet evolving regulatory needs, creating broader economic benefit and opportunity in local markets on six continents. 
With Project Natick, we even innovated beyond land, experimenting with a full-scale subsea, zero emissions datacenter 
with the promise of setting new standards for datacenter provisioning, latency and sustainability.  
We added nearly 500 new Azure capabilities in the past year alone, focused on both existing workloads and new workloads 
such as IoT and Edge AI. IoT is transforming the rules of manufacturing, retail, and oil and gas  – fueling cloud and edge 
innovation, accelerating the evolution of digital factories and enhancing supply-chain performance. Azure IoT and Azure 
Stack – a first-of-its-kind cloud-to-edge solution – enable customers and partners to build IoT solutions that run at the edge, 
so people from the factory floor to the retail  store to the oil rig can manage devices and analyze data  in real time. We 
introduced Azure Sphere, another first-of-its-kind, highly secure edge solution that combines chip design, an IoT operating 
system and a cloud service to secure the more than 9 billion microcontroller-powered devices entering the market each 
year – from kitchen appliances to  industrial equipment.  It’s an  incredible example of how we are  helping our customers 
realize the promise of a world of connected devices and things. And, our ambition extends beyond today’s computers to 
quantum computing to take  us beyond the limitations of traditional, transistor-based computers and  enable  entirely  new 
scenarios. We first unveiled our vision for quantum  last year, and we are already seeing customers apply our quantum-
inspired algorithms to address some of their most pressing challenges.  
Data and AI  
Our customers will increasingly need to build their own AI to extract insights from the ever-increasing amount of data they 
collect – and we are investing to make Azure the best cloud for their comprehensive data estates. We are democratizing 
data science and AI with Azure Cognitive Services, Azure Machine Learning and data services such as Azure Cosmos DB 
– the first globally distributed, multi-model database – to help organizations of all sizes convert their data into insights and 
experiences  for  competitive  advantage.  In  less  than  a  year,  Azure  Cosmos  DB  has  already  exceeded  $100  million  in 
annualized  revenue.  Azure  Database  for  MySQL  and  PostgreSQL  makes  it  even  easier  to  bring  open  source-powered 
applications  to  Azure,  expanding  our  opportunity  in  this  space.  And  we  are  seeing  rapid  customer  adoption  of  Azure 
Databricks  for  data  preparation,  advanced  analytics  and  machine  learning  scenarios.  We  are  leading  in  the  field  of  AI 
research, achieving human parity with object recognition, speech recognition, machine reading and – this year – language 
translation. But that is not enough. We are committed to translating these breakthroughs into toolsets our customers can 
use. More than 1 million developers have already used our Cognitive Services to quickly and easily create AI applications. 
Our Azure Bot Service has nearly 300,000 developers, and we are  
3 
 
  

--- Page 5 ---
driving new advances in our underlying cloud infrastructure, building the world’s first AI supercomputer in Azure. Microsoft 
Translator brings AI-powered translation to developers where their data is, whether in the cloud or on the edge. Our pending 
acquisition of GitHub recognizes the increasingly vital role developers will play in value creation and growth across every 
industry, and will enable us to bring our tools and services to new audiences while enabling GitHub to grow and retain its 
developer-first ethos.  
Gaming  
We are pursuing an expansive opportunity in gaming – from the way games are created and distributed to how they are 
played and viewed – surpassing $10 billion in revenue this year for the first time. We are investing aggressively in content, 
community and cloud services across every endpoint to expand usage and deepen engagement with gamers. Xbox Live 
now has 57 million monthly active users, and we are investing in new services like Mixer  – which blurs the line between 
watching and playing – and Game Pass, our new unlimited subscription service. The addition of five new gaming studios 
this year bolsters our first-party content development to support our fast-growing gaming services. And our acquisition of 
PlayFab accelerates our vision to build a world-class cloud platform for the gaming industry across mobile, PC and console. 
I’m excited about our opportunity in the fast-growing $100 billion gaming market and what’s to come.  
TRUST AND RESPONSIBILITY  
At a time when digital technology is transforming every industry and every part of our daily life and work, our customers are 
increasingly  looking  for  a  partner  whose  business  interests  are  fundamentally  aligned  with  their  own.  At  Microsoft,  our 
customers’ interests are core to our success. That is what engenders trust.  
This commitment extends to instilling trust in technology across everything we do. We believe that privacy is a fundamental 
human right, which is why compliance is deeply embedded in all our processes and practices. We extended the data subject 
rights that are at the heart of General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to all our customers around the world, not just 
those in the European Union, and advocated for the passage of the CLOUD Act in the U.S.  
Cybersecurity  is  the  central  challenge  of  the  digital  age,  and  we  are  innovating  to  provide  end-to-end  security  for  our 
customers with security operations at global scale that analyze more than 6.5 trillion security signals each day, enterprise-
class technology, and broad cybersecurity partnerships for an increasingly complex and heterogeneous world. We led the 
Cybersecurity Tech Accord, which has been signed by 61 global organizations, and are calling on governments to do more 
to make the internet safe. We announced the Defending Democracy Program to work with governments around the world 
to help safeguard voting, and introduced AccountGuard to offer advanced cybersecurity protections to political campaigns 
in the U.S.  
And, as we make advancements in AI, we are asking ourselves tough questions – like not only what computers can do, but 
what should they do. That’s why we are investing in tools for detecting and addressing bias in AI systems and advocating 
for thoughtful government regulation.  
We also have a responsibility as a company to empower everyone to fully participate in our society and economy using 
technology. We are working with governments, the private sector and local nonprofit organizations around the world to make 
this vision a reality. We donated more than $1.4 billion in software and services in fiscal 2018, via Microsoft Philanthropies, 
helping nonprofits get access to the technology they need to drive greater impact, and in calendar year 2017 our employees 
donated a record $158 million (including company match) through our employee giving program to support nonprofits in 
local communities.

We are putting AI tools into the hands of change-makers to address society’s most pressing challenges with new programs 
like AI for Earth, a five-year, $50M commitment to environmental sustainability, and AI for Accessibility to benefit the more 
than 1 billion people with disabilities around the world. I am inspired by how teams across Microsoft are galvanized around 
inclusive design and accessibility – and producing tangible results, with new features and offerings for Microsoft 365, Office 
365, Windows and Xbox designed to meet the needs of people with disabilities.  
Finally, we know that the jobs of today will not be the jobs of tomorrow and are investing to provide today’s workforce and 
future generations with the digital skills they will need to succeed, partnering with nonprofit organizations across 54 countries 
to provide computer science learning experiences to millions of young people around the world and expanding our TEALS 
program in high schools across the U.S.  
I’m proud of our progress, and I’m proud of the more than 100,000 Microsoft employees around the world who are focused 
on  our  customers’  success  in  this  new  era.  We  have  long  recognized  that  the  health,  wellbeing  and  diversity  of  our 
employees  help  Microsoft  succeed.  That’s  why  we  provide  industry-leading  benefits  for  our  employees,  including 
comprehensive health and wellness programs for families, paid vacation, paid sick leave and paid time off for new parents. 
We were one of the first companies to require our U.S. suppliers doing substantial business with us to provide paid time off 
for their employees. And this year we took a further step to ensure that these suppliers also provide their employees with 
paid parental leave.  
Over the past year, we have made progress in building a diverse and inclusive culture where everyone can do their best 
work. Since FY16, we have nearly doubled the number of women corporate vice presidents at Microsoft – both overall and 
in technical roles. We’ve increased African American/Black and Hispanic/Latino representation by 33 percent. And this past 
fiscal year more than half of our U.S. interns were women or African American/Black and Hispanic/Latino. We must keep 
pushing to do more, and representation is only one measure of progress. Creating a diverse and inclusive workplace at 
Microsoft is everyone’s job. And this year we increased our commitment, ensuring that every leader and employee prioritizes 
diversity and inclusion as part of our annual performance review process.  
In closing, we will continue to create local opportunity, growth and impact in every community and country around the world. 
We will continue to invest in the largest growth opportunities and innovate boldly to serve our customers. We will continue 
to help our customers build digital capability, so they can grow and thrive – today and long into the future. We will continue 
to  work  to  instill  trust  in  technology  across  everything  we  do,  to  advocate  for  customer  privacy,  drive  industry-wide 
cybersecurity  initiatives  and  champion  ethical  AI.  And  we  will  continue  to  transform  our  culture  to  reflect  the  diverse 
customers we serve around the world, while holding fast to our timeless values.  
Last spring, I visited our AI School in Paris, France, which we started earlier this year to provide immersive training to help 
close the skills gap. Students from different backgrounds and walks of life, with no prior technical experience, are learning  
new data science skills. They take an intense seven month class, followed by an apprenticeship at one of our local partners 
– and are ready for new careers in AI and data science. While there, I met Cassandra Delage, a young entrepreneur with 
an  ambitious  dream  of  reimagining  recycling.  Her  company,  Plast’if,  has  created  what  might  be  best  described  as  a 
“recycling vending machine.” You take plastic, put it in the machine, and it’s converted into a useful object you can take with 
you.  She  built  it  with  students  at  the  AI  School,  creating  an  ML  model  that  recognizes  the  plastic,  deploying  it  on  an 
inexpensive computer and then integrating it with a 3-D printer – turning her novel idea into reality.  
It’s just one example of how technology can help create new opportunity and build a better future for everyone.  
And it’s just the start – I could not be more optimistic about what’s yet to come.

Note About Forward-Looking Statements  
This report includes estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives, and expected operating 
results that  are “forward-looking  statements” within the  meaning  of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, 
Section 27A  of  the  Securities  Act  of  1933,  and  Section 21E  of  the  Securities  Exchange  Act  of  1934.  Forward-looking 
statements may appear throughout this report, including the following sections: “Business”, and “Management’s Discussion 
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”. These forward-looking statements generally are identified 
by the words “believe,” “project,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “intend,” “strategy,” “future,” “opportunity,” “plan,” “may,” 
“should,” “will,” “would,” “will be,” “will continue,” “will likely result,” and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are 
based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to 
differ materially. We describe risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially in “Risk 
Factors,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” and “Quantitative and 
Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” in our fiscal year 2018 Form 10-K. Readers are cautioned not to place undue 
reliance on forward-looking  statements, which  speak only as  of the date they  are made. We undertake  no  obligation to 
update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether because of new information, future events, or otherwise.  
BUSINESS  
GENERAL  
Embracing Our Future  
Microsoft is a technology company whose mission is to  empower every person  and every organization  on the planet to 
achieve more. We strive to create local opportunity, growth, and impact in every country around the world. Our platforms 
and tools help drive small business productivity, large business competitiveness, and public-sector efficiency. They also 
support new startups, improve educational and health outcomes, and empower human ingenuity.  
We  continue  to  transform  our  business  to  lead  in  the  new  era  of  the  intelligent  cloud  and  intelligent  edge.  We  bring 
technology and products together into experiences and solutions that unlock value for our customers. In this next phase of 
innovation, computing is more powerful and ubiquitous from the cloud to the edge. Artificial intelligence (“AI”) capabilities 
are rapidly advancing, fueled by data and knowledge of the world. Physical and virtual worlds are coming together to create 
richer  experiences  that  understand  the  context  surrounding  people,  the  things  they  use,  the  places  they  go,  and  their 
activities  and  relationships.  A  person’s  experience  with  technology  spans  a  multitude  of  devices  and  has  become 
increasingly more natural and multi-sensory with voice, ink, and gaze interactions.  
What We Offer  
Founded in 1975, we develop and support software, services, devices, and solutions that deliver new value for customers 
and help people and businesses realize their full potential.  
Our  products  include  operating  systems;  cross-device  productivity  applications;  server  applications;  business  solution 
applications;  desktop  and  server  management  tools;  software  development  tools;  and  video  games.  We  also  design, 
manufacture, and sell devices, including PCs, tablets, gaming and entertainment consoles, other intelligent  devices, and 
related accessories.
