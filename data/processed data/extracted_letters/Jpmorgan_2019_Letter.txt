Dear Fellow Shareholders,
Jamie Dimon,  
Chairman and  
Chief Executive Officer
As we prepare this year’s annual letter to shareholders, the world is confronting 
one of the greatest health threats of a generation, one that profoundly 
impacts the global economy and all of its citizens. Our thoughts remain with 
the communities and individuals, including healthcare workers and first 
responders, most deeply hit by the COVID-19 crisis. 
Throughout our history, JPMorgan Chase has built its reputation on being 
there for clients, customers and communities in the most critical times. This 
unprecedented environment is no different. Our actions during this global crisis 
are essential to keeping the global economy going and will be remembered for 
years to come.
In these annual letters, I usually cover a range of topics, including a review of 
JPMorgan Chase’s principles, priorities and performance, as well as the broader 
geopolitical issues facing our company and the most critical public policy issues 
2

affecting our country. When the time is right and the future is clearer, I will 
provide a more complete and current view on how this crisis might change 
our strategies around how we run the company, work with our clients and 
governments, and develop public policy solutions. However, right now, as we 
deal with the spiraling effects of this pandemic, I want to focus on what we as 
a bank can do to remain strong, resilient and well-positioned to support our 
colleagues, clients, customers and communities across the globe. 
Looking back on the last two decades — starting from my time as CEO of Bank 
One in 2000 — the firm has weathered some unprecedented challenges, as we 
will with this current pandemic, but they did not stop us from accomplishing 
some extraordinary things. Once again, you should know how grateful and 
proud I am of our more than 200,000 employees around the world. I also want 
to thank Daniel Pinto, Gordon Smith, our Operating Committee, our Board of 
Directors and our senior leaders for the exceptional leadership they have shown 
under the most difficult of circumstances.  
We entered this crisis in a position of strength. 2019 was another strong year 
for JPMorgan Chase, with the firm generating record revenue and net income, 
as well as setting numerous other records across our lines of business. We 
earned $36.4 billion in net income on revenue1 of $118.7 billion, reflecting 
strong underlying performance across our businesses. We now have delivered 
record results in nine of the last 10 years2 and are confident we will continue 
to do so in the future, though it should be expected that our earnings will be 
down meaningfully in 2020. Our largest businesses grew revenue and net 
income for the year, while the firm continued to make significant investments 
in products, people and technology. We grew core loans by 2%, increased 
deposits overall by 5% and generally broadened market share across our 
businesses, all while maintaining credit discipline and a fortress balance sheet. 
In total, we extended credit and raised capital of $2.3 trillion for businesses, 
institutional clients and U.S. customers.

JPMorgan Chase stock is owned by large institutions, pension plans, mutual 
funds and directly by individual investors. However, it is important to remember 
that in almost all cases, the ultimate beneficiaries are individuals in our 
communities. Approximately 100 million people in the United States own 
stock, and a large percentage of these individuals, in one way or another, own 
JPMorgan Chase stock. Many of these people are veterans, teachers, police 
officers, firefighters, retirees, or those saving for a home, school or retirement. 
Your management team goes to work every day recognizing the enormous 
responsibility that we have to perform for our shareholders. 
While we don’t run the company worrying about the stock price in the short 
run, in the long run our stock price is a measure of the progress we have made 
over the years. This progress is a function of continual investments, in good and 
bad times, to build our capabilities — our people, systems and products. These 
important investments drive the future prospects of our company and position 
it to grow and prosper for decades. Whether looking back over five years, 10 
years or since the JPMorgan Chase and Bank One merger (15 years ago), our 
stock has significantly outperformed the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and the 
Standard & Poor’s Financials Index.

Tangible book value over time captures the company’s use of capital, balance sheet and profitability. In this chart, we are looking at 
heritage Bank One shareholders and JPMorgan Chase & Co. shareholders. The chart shows the increase in tangible book value per share;  
it is an after-tax number that assumes all dividends were retained vs. the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (S&P 500 Index), which is a  
pretax number that includes reinvested dividends.

The results shown above use our stock price as of December 31, 2019. If you 
compare that with our stock price as of March 31, 2020, you would see a 
dramatic change. For example, the overall stock price gain from the date of the 
JPMorgan Chase and Bank One merger was 442% at the end of last year, but 
it dropped to 252% three months later. While that’s still far better than many 
companies’ performance, it illustrates the volatility of returns. 
Unlike past letters, the placement of charts about the performance of our lines 
of business and our fortress balance sheet is different — they can be found in an 
appendix following this letter to peruse at your leisure. Instead, I am going to 
focus my comments in the rest of this letter on issues that relate to our current 
crisis. And while I enjoy sharing my opinion on many other matters, I will avoid 
doing so this year.

  Within this letter, I discuss the following:
   Dealing With an Extraordinary Crisis
1.  We go to extraordinary lengths to help our customers — consumers, 
small businesses, midsize companies, large corporations, and state 
and local governments. 
2.  We take excellent care of our employees.
3.  We make extraordinary efforts to lift up our communities, especially 
in challenging times.
4.  We are transparent with our shareholders: What they should expect 
regarding our financial and operating performance in 2020.
5.  We are working closely with all levels of government during this 
crisis — and while we will participate in government programs to 
address the severe economic challenges, we will not request any 
regulatory relief for ourselves. 
6.  We need a plan to get safely back to work.
7.  We need to come together: My fervent hope for America.

D EA LI NG WITH AN EXTRAORDINA RY   CRISIS
A corporation – essentially any institution – 
is a living, breathing organism made up of 
people, technology, institutional knowledge 
and relationships and is generally organized 
around mission and purpose. Entering into 
a crisis is not the time to figure out what 
you want to be. You must already be a 
well-functioning organization prepared to 
rapidly mobilize your resources, take your 
losses and survive another day for the good 
of all your stakeholders. 
No matter the challenge, we manage our 
company consistently with principles that 
have stood the test of time. I have written 
about these inviolable principles often – the 
need for extremely talented and motivated 
employees; a fortress balance sheet that 
allows us to invest in good times and in bad 
times; clear, comprehensive and accurate 
financial, risk and operating reporting to 
let us make quick and accurate decisions; a 
devotion to our customers and communi-
ties; and continuous investing in technology 
to better serve both our employees and our 
customers. (These principles also underlie 
an organization’s preparedness for tough 
competition – I was going to write this year 
that the competition is back in all of its 
facets. There’ll be more to come on that next 
year.)
We are there for our customers, employees 
and communities in good and bad times 
– we are a port in the storm. It is in the 
toughest of times that we need to use our 
capital and liquidity to help clients – large 
and small. COVID-19 is one of those extraor-
dinary times. Below are some of the things 
we are doing to help our company and our 
customers during this global crisis. 
1.  We go to extraordinary lengths to help our customers — consumers, small businesses, 
midsize companies, large corporations, and state and local governments.
First and foremost, we have to be prepared to 
operate under extremely adverse circumstances.
The significant economic fallout from this 
crisis reinforces the critical need to keep the 
global financial system fully functioning – 
and we recognize that our firm is an 
important part of the global economy. 
Therefore, we incorporate plans for resil-
ience in everything we do – resilience for 
hurricanes, data center failures, cyber attacks 
and other issues. And while we had not 
envisioned the effects of a pandemic like 
this one, all of this preparation has paid off 
– and we have been able to accomplish far 
more and far more quickly than we origi-
nally thought possible. It is absolutely 
essential that we be up and functioning for 
all of our customers each and every day. 
How else would we process $6 trillion in 
payments or buy and sell approximately  
$2 trillion in securities and foreign exchange 
transactions for our clients on a daily basis? 
And how else would we raise more than  
$2 trillion of credit and capital for our 
clients each year? Our branches, collectively, 
have 1 million customer visits each day, and 
our combined credit card and debit card 
transaction volume totals $1.1 trillion a year. 
During this crisis, we have been utilizing our 
disaster recovery sites and implementing 
alternative work arrangements globally.  
We now have more than 180,000 employees 
working from home (and quite effectively), 
including traders, bankers, portfolio managers, 
8

--- Page 11 ---
and operations and call center teams across 
the globe. We are ensuring they continue 
to operate at the highest standards with the 
proper technological tools and access so they 
can serve their clients safely and seamlessly. 
Over the past few weeks, we have had nearly 
150,000 concurrent virtual sessions – nearly 
five times our pre-pandemic average – and we 
have capacity in reserve to support signifi-
cantly more demand if necessary.
We’re taking significant steps to help our 
consumer customers.
After Superstorm Sandy, Hurricane Harvey 
and other devastating natural disasters 
around the globe, after wildfires ravaged 
California towns and after a number of 
other tragic events, we stepped up for our 
customers. Today, we are doing the same 
across the country as we work individually 
with customers facing COVID-19-related 
hardships. 
We have been helping our customers, who 
tell us about their financial struggles as a 
result of the crisis, and are offering relief 
measures such as: 
•  Providing a 90-day grace period for  
mortgage and auto loan/lease payments 
and waiving any associated late fees.
Of our approximately 5,000 Chase branches, 
we have managed to keep three-quarters of 
them open – and safe – for our customers 
who need our services. In every one of our 
markets, almost all of our 2,300 branches 
with drive-up windows have remained open 
for business, allowing people to maintain 
a safe distance. Our 17,000 bankers have 
continued to take appointments and proac-
tively reach out to customers – helping them 
manage their finances and use our digital 
tools – often letting customers stay home. 
In addition, the vast majority of our 16,850 
ATMs are well-stocked and still functioning 
to provide needed cash to our customers. 
Our call centers have not fared as well; 
many of them have been effectively shut 
down by local restrictions. As the volume of 
calls has increased from customers seeking 
assistance, hold times have also increased. 
We have mobilized quickly to address this 
issue, reminding customers that our digital 
self-service capabilities are always available 
for them to check balances, deposit checks 
or make payments. Additionally, we have 
built new tools – digital and electronic – to 
allow customers to request relief without 
waiting for a specialist. And we are making it 
possible for our displaced phone specialists 
to work from home. 
•  Removing minimum payment require-
ments on credit cards and waiving  
associated late fees.
We are also taking significant action to support 
businesses — small, midsize and large — and state 
and local governments. 
•  Not reporting payment deferrals such as 
late payments to credit bureaus for up-to-
date clients.
•  Continuing to responsibly lend to  
qualified consumers.
•  Waiving or refunding some fees, including 
early withdrawal fees on certificates of 
deposit.

response at: www.chase.com/stayconnected.
Clearly, some clients may be much more 
vulnerable than others – for example, trans-
portation companies, hospitality enterprises, 
hospitals, utilities and, in particular, small 
businesses that do not have enough capital 
to withstand sudden and sustained down-
turns in income. JPMorgan Chase Institute 
research reveals that 50% of small busi-
nesses have less than 15 cash buffer days, 
reinforcing why small businesses are being 
heavily disrupted by the current crisis and 
9

•  Continuing to support vital institutions to 
keep our communities strong: Increased 
funding in March included, for example, 
$1.9 billion for hospitals and healthcare 
companies, $270 million for educational 
institutions, $360 million for nonprofits, 
and $240 million for state and local 
governments. 
•  Continuing to fund construction projects 
essential to our communities (affordable 
housing, food banks and grocery stores) 
through our $5 billion commitment. 
Recognizing the extraordinary extension of 
new credit, mentioned above, and knowing 
there will be a major recession mean that we 
are exposing ourselves to billions of dollars 
of additional credit losses as we help both 
consumer and business customers through 
these difficult times. (We will provide more 
detail on these actions later in this letter.) Of 
course, we are in continual contact with our 
regulators about our actions and efforts. 
We stand ready to assist the government in 
implementing stimulus package benefits to 
support the economy. 
We applaud the speed with which the federal 
government and the Federal Reserve (the 
Fed), as well as other central banks around 
the world, put together a stimulus package 
and other funding benefits to help individ-
uals, businesses, and state and local entities 
across the United States and beyond. Much 
remains to be done to assure these resources 
can be quickly and effectively rolled out. 
We hope to be at the forefront of using this 
assistance to help our customers get through 
what is certain to be a difficult next few 
months. We will not use this relief funding 
for ourselves.
will feel the effects for a significant period of 
time – even as more capital from the recent 
federal stimulus program reaches them. 
To support businesses during this current 
crisis, we are doing the following: 
•  Prudently extending credit to businesses 
of all sizes for working capital and general 
corporate purposes. For example, in the 
past 60 days alone, we have extended $950 
million in new loans to small businesses.
•  Waiving and refunding fees for those 
businesses in need and finding ways 
to help more small businesses through 
resources available at the Small Business 
Administration.
•  Servicing clients with additional credit 
through revolving facilities, when appro-
priate, and stepping in to try to help with 
credit when others can’t or won’t.
•  Continuing in the ordinary course of busi-
ness to sustain consumers, businesses and 
communities with about $500 billion of 
credit and capital raised every quarter. 
•  Continuing to maintain undrawn 
revolving commitments in our wholesale 
businesses, which totaled approximately 
$295 billion as of the close of business on 
March 31, 2020. Companies have already 
drawn down more than $50 billion of their 
revolvers to prepare themselves for the 
crisis (this already dramatically exceeds 
what happened in the global financial 
crisis). Many others have requested addi-
tional credit, which we have been offering 
judiciously – more than $25 billion of new 
credit extensions were approved in the 
month of March alone.
•  Continuing the issuance of bonds for 
highly rated companies ($85 billion) – it 
may surprise you that the first quarter of 
2020 will be our largest quarter for invest-
ment grade issuance, led by J.P. Morgan.

2.  We take excellent care of our employees.
Times like these reinforce that our employees 
are our most important asset – they are 
fundamental to the vibrancy and success of 
our company. Excellence in everything we do 
– from operations and technology to service 
and reputation – depends upon the abilities 
and character of our employees. Our vast and 
diverse team of people serves our customers 
and communities, builds the technology, 
makes the strategic decisions, manages the 
risks, determines our investments and drives 
innovation. Setting aside differing views of 
our complex world and the risks and oppor-
tunities ahead, it is inarguable that having 
such an extraordinary team – people with 
guts, brains and enormous capabilities who 
can navigate whatever circumstances bring – 
is what ensures our future prosperity.
In last year’s letter, I wrote about the 
many ways we take excellent care of our 
employees: competitive wages and compen-
sation, 401(k) retirement benefits, health 
benefits and wellness programs, extensive 
training programs, volunteer and employee 
engagement opportunities, generous parental 
leave policies and much more.
During this pandemic, we have also taken 
extensive steps to protect and support our 
employees and their families. For example:
•  We continue to pay employees who are 
at home because they have had potential 
exposure to the virus or whose health is 
higher risk. Additionally, we provide paid 
medical leave to employees who are unwell.  
•  We have clinical staff internally to support 
our employees through this difficult time, 
whether it is fielding general inquiries 
related to COVID-19 or locating testing or 
other medical facilities.   
•  All employees are receiving five additional 
paid days off to help manage personal 
needs, which may include dependent care, 
child care or other issues.
•  A special payment of up to $1,000 has 
been granted to full- and part-time 
employees whose job requires them to 
continue working on-site and generally 
whose annual cash compensation is less 
than $60,000.
•  All branch employees are being paid for 
their regularly scheduled hours even if 
those hours are reduced or their branch is 
temporarily closed.
•  For those who must go to work on-site, we 
are reinforcing both basic and enhanced 
personal and office hygiene measures 
to keep them, their colleagues and their 
clients safe. We have modified business 
operations, staggered shifts, changed 
seating arrangements, closed buildings to 
nonessential visitors and provided addi-
tional equipment where possible. We have 
also intensified nightly and daily cleaning 
of all offices and branches worldwide that 
remain open.
It’s amazing how quickly we have mobilized 
and implemented work-from-home and other 
resiliency measures – in weeks instead of 
months or years. There are great lessons to 
be learned from this experience.
While conditions may sometimes be unusual 
and difficult, we are functioning smoothly. In 
fact, over the last month in certain parts of 
our company, we’ve had the highest volume 
and transaction totals we have ever seen. 
Needless to say, this success would be impos-
sible without our exceptional employees, and 
we recognize our responsibility to support 
both their professional and personal lives 
now more than ever.
