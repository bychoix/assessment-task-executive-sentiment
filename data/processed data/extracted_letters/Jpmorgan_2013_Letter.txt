Dear Fellow Shareholders,
Jamie Dimon,  
Chairman and  
Chief Executive Officer
What a year. Despite tremendous challenges, your company earned $17.9 billion in 
net income on revenue of $96.6 billion in 2013. Our financial results reflected strong 
underlying performance across our four main businesses — unfortunately marred by 
significant legal settlements largely related to mortgages. These legal expenses cost the 
company $8.6 billion after-tax. Excluding these expenses and some one-time positive 
benefits from reserve reductions (which we never have considered true earnings) and 
one-time gains on the sale of assets, your company earned about $23 billion. 
As tough as the year was — the company was under constant and intense pressure —  
I can hardly express the admiration, even pride, I feel because of the enduring resolve 
and resiliency of our management team and our employees. They never wavered as 
they attacked our problems while maintaining a relentless focus on serving our clients. 
We all owe them a great deal of gratitude. 
The bad news was bad. The most painful, difficult and nerve-wracking experience 
that I have ever dealt with professionally was trying to resolve the legal issues we 
had this past year with multiple government agencies and regulators as we tried to 
get many large and risky legal issues behind us, including the Chief Investment Office 
(CIO) situation (that happened in 2012) and mortgage-related matters (that happened

primarily in 2005-2008, a significant portion of which occurred at heritage Bear 
Stearns and Washington Mutual (WaMu)). 
There is much to say and a lot to be learned in analyzing what happened, but I am not 
going to do so in this letter — more distance and perspective are required. Suffice it to 
say, we thought the best option, perhaps the only sensible option — for our company, 
our clients and our shareholders — was to acknowledge our issues and settle as much 
as we could all at once, albeit at a high price. This allowed us to focus on what we are 
here for: serving our clients and communities around the world.
The good news is that our four franchises maintained — and even strengthened — our 
leadership positions as we continued to gain market share and improve customer 
satisfaction in every business.
When I look back at our company last year with all of our ups and downs, I see it as A 
Tale of Two Cities: “It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.” We came through 
it scarred but strengthened — steadfast in our commitment to do the best we can. 
And we believe that we continued to deliver for our shareholders. For Bank One 
shareholders since March 27, 2000, the stock has performed far better than most 
financial companies and the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (S&P 500). And since the 
JPMorgan Chase & Co. merger with Bank One on July 1, 2004, we have performed well 
vs. other financial companies and slightly below the S&P 500. The details are shown in 
the tables on the following page. One of the tables also shows the growth in tangible 
book value per share, which we believe is a conservative measure of value. You can see 
that it has grown far more than the S&P 500 in both time periods.

Tangible book value over time captures the company’s use of capital, balance sheet and profitability. In this chart, we are looking at 
heritage Bank One shareholders and JPMorgan Chase & Co. shareholders. The chart shows the increase in tangible book value per share; 
it is an after-tax number assuming all dividends were retained vs. the S&P 500 (a pre-tax number with dividends reinvested).
(a) On March 27, 2000, Jamie Dimon was hired as CEO of Bank One
Here’s what most of the headlines left out: JPMorgan Chase continued to serve our 
clients and make a significant positive impact on our communities. In 2013, the firm 
provided credit and raised capital of more than $2.1 trillion for our clients. The 
firm also has hired more than 6,300 military veterans since 2011 as a proud founding 
member of the 100,000 Jobs Mission, which now has increased the goal to 200,000 
jobs. Our firm was there to help small businesses — we provided $19 billion of credit 
to U.S. small businesses, which allowed them to develop new products, expand their 
operations and hire more workers. We also were there for families to buy their first 
home with a mortgage we made possible — overall, we originated more than 800,000 
mortgages last year. In total, we provided $274 billion of credit to consumers. Our 
strength allows us to be there for our clients and communities in good times — and,  
more important, in bad times. In this, we have never faltered.

In this letter, I will discuss the issues highlighted below. I also encourage you to read 
the letters written by several of our business leaders about our main businesses, our 
critical operations and controls, and some of our corporate responsibility efforts. 
As usual, this letter will describe some of our successes and opportunities, as well as 
our challenges and issues. The main sections of the letter are as follows: 
I.  We face the future with a strong foundation and excellent franchises built to serve 
our clients 
II.  We will dedicate extraordinary effort in 2014 adapting to the new global financial 
architecture
III.  We have made significant progress strengthening our company 
IV.  We believe our long-term outlook is bright

I.   WE F ACE THE  FUTURE  WITH  A  ST RO NG   FO UNDATI ON 
AND EXCELLE N T F RA NC HI S ES  BUI LT  TO SE RV E   OUR 
CLIE NTS 
During 2014, most of the contours of the new 
and complex global financial architecture 
will be put in place. The changes are exten-
sive – and later in this letter, I will talk about 
just how extensive they are. All banks will 
have to adjust to the new rules, which will be 
harder for some than for others. Some may 
have to make drastic changes to their busi-
ness plan and strategies. So as we enter the 
year, we should take stock of where we stand. 
We have consistently shown good financial 
performance and maintained our fortress 
balance sheet
All of our businesses have had good – in 
fact, close to best-in-class – financial perfor-
mance over the last several years in terms of 
margins and returns on tangible common 
equity. We have done this while meeting 
increasingly higher standards in liquidity 
and capital. Our fortress balance sheet is 
stronger than ever.
We have an enormous amount of what we 
consider highly liquid assets 
First and foremost are the High Quality 
Liquid Assets (HQLA), shown in the chart 
below, which are mostly deposits at central 
banks, agency mortgage-backed securities 
and Treasuries. Only HQLA count for liquid 
assets under the banking regulators’ defini-
tion of liquidity. These assets are super safe 
and can provide cash to the company should 
it need cash in a crisis situation.

2 HQLA is the estimated amount of assets the firm believes will qualify for inclusion in the Basel III Liquidity Coverage Ratio and primarily 
includes U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, U.S. Treasuries, sovereign bonds and other government-guaranteed or government- 
sponsored securities

Excludes trading securities and collateral received in reverse repo agreements

--- Page 10 ---
In addition to the HQLA securities, other 
unencumbered marketable securities 
can provide significant liquidity for the 
company. (This category does not include 
any securities held in our trading port-
folio.) Our investment securities portfolio 
has an average duration of 2.8 years and an 
average AA+ rating. The majority of securi-
ties balances presented above reside in our 
investment securities. These securities could 
be utilized to provide liquidity and a source 
of cash for the company if necessary.
Our total assets are $2.4 trillion so you can 
see just how liquid our balance sheet is. As 
a reference point, our cash and high-quality 
securities are essentially the same as the 
$740 billion of our total loans. This is a very 
conservative utilization of our total deposits 
of approximately $1.3 trillion.
We have increasingly strong capital ratios
You can see on the capital chart below that 
under Basel I, our Tier 1 Common has gone 
from 7.0% to 10.7% from 2007–2013 (if 
Basel I had been consistently applied, that 
number would have been 11.8%), and our 
new Basel III ratio has gone from 5.0% to 
9.5% over that same time period.
In 2014, we will meet all of our current targets 
in capital, liquidity and leverage. One ratio 
not shown in the chart is called the Supple-
mentary Leverage Ratio (SLR) that is, simply, 
the ratio of equity to assets and certain off-
balance sheet exposures, regardless of the 
quality of assets. While that calculation still 
is being finalized, we currently are at 4.6% 
vs. a requirement of 5%. We intend to have a 
cushion over 5% by the end of this year.
We have good returns on capital despite 
increasingly higher capital ratios
Even with the increasingly higher capital 
ratios over the past several years, all of our 
main businesses have been earning strong 
returns on tangible equity (see Return on 
Equity (ROE) chart on the following page). 
Some of our competitors are not earning 
similar returns, and they likely will feel more 
pressure to alter their business strategies 
going forward.

Later in this letter, I will discuss how we 
think all the new rules will affect our returns. 
Our scale and breadth create large cross-
sell opportunities and strong competitive 
advantage 
Each of our four major businesses oper-
ates at good economies of scale and gets 
significant additional advantages from the 
other businesses. We believe this is one of 
the key reasons we have maintained good 
financial performance.
Below are some pretty powerful examples:
•	 Our	North	America	Investment	Bank	
generates 29% of its investment banking 
revenue1 through Commercial Bank clients 
covered locally. This helps both our  
Investment Bank and our Commercial 
Bank do a better job serving their clients.
•	 Our	Global	Corporate	Bank	helped	generate	
$1.3 billion in revenue for our fixed income 
sales and trading operation, increasing 
business to our trading desks and helping 
them offer better pricing to our clients.
•	 Our	Private	Bank	gets	new	clients	from	both	
our Investment Bank and our Commercial 
Bank.	And	the	Private	Bank	and	Commer-
cial Bank would have a hard time existing 
without our Chase retail branch network. In 
fact, 55% of Commercial Bank clients and 
35%	of	Private	Bank	households	visit	our	
retail branches each quarter.
•	 Of	our	$1.6	trillion	of	assets	under	
management, approximately $300 billion 
comes from the Corporate & Investment 
Bank (CIB), the Commercial Bank or the 
Consumer Bank.
•	 Fifty-five	percent	of	retail	mortgages	and	
40% of Chase-branded credit cards are sold 
through the retail branches.
In total, we believe that the combination of 
our businesses accounts for $15 billion of 
additional revenue, which helps drive both 
profits and customer satisfaction. Each of our 
businesses would be worse off but for the 
other three. 
Our capabilities are extraordinary and are difficult 
to replicate — we can bring huge resources to bear 
for the benefit of our company and our clients
Our scale creates huge cost efficiencies and 
enables significant resources to be brought 
to bear for the benefit of our company. For 
example, in global technology, we have 
nearly 30,000 programmers, application 
developers and information technology 
employees who keep our 7,200 applications, 
32 data centers, 58,000 servers, 300,000 desk-
tops and global network operating smoothly 
for all our clients. Resources like these allow 
us to constantly improve our operating 
efficiencies and bring enormous capability 
to deal with issues when we need to do so 
such as adjusting to all the new global rules 
and requirements. In total, we believe that 
expense synergies across the company save 
us approximately $3 billion a year.

Across the firm, we serve approximately 
50% of U.S. households, approximately 80% 
of Fortune 500 companies, and 60% of the 
world’s largest pensions, sovereigns and 
central banks. Today, our firm has on-the-
ground operations in 60 countries and serves 
clients in more than 100 countries around 
the world. To support those clients, we move 
up to $10 trillion a day and lend or raise 
capital of over $500 billion each quarter. 
The markets in which we operate cover 5.6 
billion people who speak 100+ languages 
and use close to 50 currencies. It would be 
difficult to replicate the size, capabilities and 
knowledgeable staff of our businesses glob-
ally. We can help our clients when and where 
they need it. 
It is important to remember our capabili-
ties and efficiencies accrue to our clients – 
over time, they get the benefit in improved 
pricing or better services. 
This has led to increasing market share 
and customer satisfaction in all of our main 
businesses
None	of	the	things	previously	mentioned	
would matter if they didn’t help us do a 
better job for our customers. You know your 
business model is working when customers 
– voting with their feet – give you more busi-
ness. Increasing market share and customer 
satisfaction may not always immediately 
show on the bottom line – but both are crit-
ical to the future growth of our businesses 
and drive current and potential earnings 
power of the company. The bullet points that 
follow say it strongly.

We have never been a fair-weather friend 
— we hope that, over time, this builds more 
trust and respect
During the recent financial crisis and 
throughout	our	200-year	history,	JPMorgan	
Chase always has been there for our constitu-
ents around the world – not only in good 
times but, more critically, in the toughest 
of times when strong banks are needed the 
most. However terrifying events became, we 
never wavered in supporting our clients and 
communities. In fact, we did many bold and 
unprecedented things, including acquiring 
Bear	Stearns	and	WaMu.	And	we	never	
stopped raising capital and providing credit 
for companies, nonprofits, states, municipali-
ties, hospitals and universities during times 
of trouble. And when the situation became 
very difficult in European countries such as 
Greece,	Italy	and	Spain,	we	stayed	to	help	
our clients, which included the countries 
themselves. While we may make mistakes 
along the way, we never lose sight of why we 
are here. We believe that our long-term view 
and consistent behavior earn us the trust and 
respect of our clients and the communities in 
which we operate.
Our strategy remains the same — and we 
always invest for the long run
While we need to make a lot of adjustments 
to adapt to the new world (I will discuss later 
in this letter how we intend to do that), we 
are fortunate not to have to do a strategic 
reset. Our strategies have worked – a consis-
tent strategy properly executed is important 
for the long-term success of any company.
So whatever the future brings, we will face it 
from a position of strength and stability. And 
we will continue to do what we always have 
done – manage the company and invest for 
the long run.
