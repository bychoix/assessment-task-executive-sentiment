TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS, CUSTOMERS, PARTNERS AND EMPLOYEES:  
It is a humbling experience to write this letter to you as only the third CEO in Microsoft’s history. As I said when I took this 
role, I originally joined Microsoft to have an opportunity to change the world through technology and empower people to do 
amazing things. Many companies aspire to change the world, but very few have the talent, resources and perseverance of 
Microsoft.  
I believe this is a landmark moment for the company and for our industry as a whole. Cloud and mobile technologies are 
redefining how people work and play. Three billion people will soon be connected to Internet-enabled devices; 212 billion 
sensors will come online  in a few short  years; trillions will be  spent  in consumer and business technologies. But  it’s  not 
about  technology  for  technology’s  sake!  It’s  our  mission  to  enable  the  use  of  technology  to  realize  the  true  potential  of 
people, teams and organizations.  
As I shared in my email to employees in July, we will be the productivity and platform company for this mobile-first and 
cloud-first world. We will empower every person and every organization on the planet to do more and achieve more. And 
we will accomplish this by building incredible Digital Work and Life Experiences, supported by our Cloud Operating System, 
the Device Operating System and Hardware platforms.  
In the same way that we aspired to and achieved our original  vision of a PC on every desk and in  every  home,  we will 
reinvent productivity. This clarity of purpose and boldness of our aspiration inspires me and all of us at Microsoft.  
We began to take steps toward this core focus last fiscal year.  
To drive our mobile strategy, we acquired Nokia’s Devices and Services business, creating an expanded Microsoft Devices 
Group  that  includes  Nokia  phones,  Xbox  hardware,  Surface,  Perceptive  Pixel  products  and  accessories.  We  also 
announced Office on iPad, which led to 35 million downloads of Word, Excel, PowerPoint and OneNote – becoming many 
of the most popular applications in the Apple App Store.  
In addition, we introduced Cortana, a personal assistant built into Windows Phone 8.1 that learns and provides information 
proactively to users, while protecting their privacy. And we launched the Surface Pro 3, a groundbreaking new tablet built 
to  replace  your  laptop.  Finally,  we  provided  Windows  licenses  at  zero  dollars  for  any  original  equipment  manufacturer 
building a device less than nine inches in size, which we expect to drive an amazing mix of innovative, low-cost devices for 
consumers this year.  
We continued to build upon our success in the cloud. Commercial cloud revenue hit a $4.4 billion annual run-rate, making 
us an undisputed leader; we grew Hyper-V to 30.6 percent of the market, taking share from competitors; and we expanded 
our datacenter footprint into Australia, Brazil, Japan and China. We brought industry-leading in-memory technology to the 
new version of SQL Server 2014, and we launched two cloud-based services – the Enterprise Mobility Suite for handling 
identity and security on devices, and the Azure Intelligent Systems Service for managing the “Internet of Things.”  
Despite  this  busy  year  of  new  products  and  significant  change  for  the  company,  we  delivered  strong  results,  including 
revenue of more than $86 billion, gross margin of nearly $60 billion and operating income of $27.8 billion. We also returned 
more than $15.7 billion in cash to our shareholders, a 27 percent increase from 2013.  
Looking forward, we  have a rich product road map that  positions  us to thrive  in a mobile-first  and cloud-first world. For 
example, we recently  launched Delve, an Office 365 cloud-based  service that automatically  brings  relevant documents, 
data  and  other  artifacts  to  workers.  And  we  announced  our  intention  to  acquire  Mojang,  the  Stockholm-based  game 
developer of the popular “Minecraft” franchise, a game that spans PCs, consoles, tablets and mobile. We also plan to launch 
Skype  Translator  this  fiscal  year,  which  has  the  potential  to  dramatically  break  down  language  barriers  in  our 
communications. And, perhaps most important, we recently previewed new features and innovations in the next version of 
Windows, Windows 10.  
All of these new services and experiences will be underpinned by significant investments in our cloud strategy – including 
building  more  datacenters  and  increasing  capacity  in  existing  regions;  expanding  our  hybrid  cloud  offerings  with  new 
releases of StorSimple, InMage and other products; and launching new cloud capabilities, such as Azure Machine Learning, 
an offering that has the potential to be game-changing in helping people mine data for predictions.

As CEO, I am committed to ensuring Microsoft makes the most of this landmark moment. And, at the same time, it is equally 
important to evolve our culture – becoming more customer-obsessed across all our products, focusing on leading indicators 
like usage, and ensuring Microsoft continues to be the best place for smart, curious people to do great work.  
I believe reinventing productivity and building platforms that empower every person and organization on the planet to do 
more and achieve more is a huge undertaking. But it is one that Microsoft is uniquely qualified to take on. We are ready 
again to change the world.  
Thank you for your continued support,  
Satya Nadella  
Chief Executive Officer

BUSINESS DESCRIPTION  
GENERAL  
Microsoft was founded in 1975. Our mission is to enable people and organizations throughout the world to do more and 
achieve more by creating technology that transforms the way people learn, work, play, and communicate. We develop and 
market software, services, and devices that deliver new opportunities, greater convenience, and enhanced value to people’s 
lives. We do business worldwide and have offices in more than 100 countries.  
We  generate  revenue  by  developing,  licensing,  and  supporting  a  wide  range  of  software  products  and  services,  by 
designing, manufacturing, and selling devices, and by delivering relevant online advertising to a global customer audience. 
In addition to selling individual products and services, we offer suites of products and services.  
Our  products  include  operating  systems  for  computing  devices,  servers,  phones,  and  other  intelligent  devices;  server 
applications for distributed computing environments; productivity applications; business solution applications; desktop and 
server  management  tools;  software  development  tools;  video  games;  and  online  advertising.  We  also  design  and  sell 
hardware  including  PCs,  tablets,  gaming  and  entertainment  consoles,  phones,  other  intelligent  devices,  and  related 
accessories.  
We offer cloud-based  solutions that provide customers  with  software,  services, and content over the  Internet by way  of 
shared computing  resources  located  in centralized data  centers. Examples of cloud-based computing  services we offer 
include Bing, Microsoft Azure, Microsoft Dynamics CRM Online, Microsoft Office 365, OneDrive, Skype, Xbox Live, and 
Yammer. Cloud revenue is earned primarily from usage fees, advertising, and subscriptions. We also provide consulting 
and product and solution support services, and we train and certify computer system integrators and developers.  
We conduct research and develop advanced technologies for future software, devices, and services. We believe that we 
will continue to grow and meet our customers’ needs as the productivity and platform company for the mobile-first and cloud-
first world. We will continue to create new opportunities for partners, increase customer satisfaction, and improve our service 
excellence, business efficacy, and internal processes.  
OPERATING SEGMENTS  
During the first quarter of fiscal year 2014, we changed our organizational structure as part of our transformation to a devices 
and services company. As a result, information that our chief operating decision maker regularly reviews for purposes of 
allocating  resources  and  assessing  performance  changed.  Therefore,  beginning  in  fiscal  year  2014,  we  reported  our 
financial performance based on our new segments: Devices and Consumer (“D&C”) Licensing, D&C Hardware, D&C Other, 
Commercial Licensing, and Commercial Other.  On April 25, 2014, we completed the transaction to acquire substantially all 
of Nokia Corporation’s (“Nokia”) Devices and Services Business (“NDS”). We report the financial performance of NDS in 
our  new  Phone  Hardware  segment.  Prior  to  the  acquisition  of  NDS,  financial  results  associated  with  our  joint  strategic 
initiatives with Nokia were reflected in our D&C Licensing segment. The contractual relationship with Nokia related to those 
initiatives terminated in conjunction with the acquisition. With the creation of the new Phone Hardware segment, the D&C 
Hardware segment was renamed Computing and Gaming Hardware in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014.
