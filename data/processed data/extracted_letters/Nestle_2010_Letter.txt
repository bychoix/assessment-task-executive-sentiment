create value not just for their 
shareholders but also for the societies 
in which they operate. We call this 
“Creating Shared Value”. We talk about 
this in more detail in this report, as well 
as our progress in relation to the United 
Nations Global Compact. 
Our commitment to Creating Shared 
Value and our principle-based 
approach to running our business 
stand front-and-centre as we pursue 
our objective of being the reference for 
financial performance in our industry 
because we want to achieve this whilst 
also being trusted by all stakeholders. 
The Nestlé Model has the objective of 
every year achieving a high level of 
organic growth and improving the EBIT 
margin. In the last ten years we have 
averaged an annual 6.3% organic 
growth and an annual 30 basis point 
improvement in the reported EBIT 
margin. The benefit of our EBIT 
growing faster than our organic sales  
is reflected in the improving trend in 
our cash-flow performance, which is  
in turn reflected in the increased 
dividend paid to our shareholders, up 
236% per share over that same 10-year 
time frame. And, in the last six years, 
your Company has been paying a 
dividend and carrying out a significant 
share buy-back, which together total 
CHF 60 billion over that time.
Comparability, transparency and  
the ability to be benchmarked are  
entry points to being the reference for 
financial performance: your Board 
committed in 2010 to change our  
sales recognition policy with effect 
from 2011 to facilitate comparisons  
of performance with our peers  
by bringing into line those of our key 
reported financial performance 
indicators that were not already directly 
comparable. We believe this will not 
only facilitate external-benchmarking 
of our performance, but that it will  
also bring even closer alignment 
between internal targets and those 
value drivers that are of most 
importance to our shareholders.
There was one change to the 
Executive Board in 2010. Richard 
Laube decided to leave the Company 
Nestlé Annual Report 2010
We are starting 2011 with  
continued momentum, well placed  
to face uncertainties ahead, including 
volatile raw material prices. We are 
therefore confident of achieving  
the Nestlé Model in 2011: organic 
growth between 5% and 6%  
and an EBIT margin improvement  
in constant currencies.
and was replaced as Head of Nestlé 
Nutrition and on the Executive Board 
by Doreswamy (Nandu) Nandkishore. 
Nandu, of Indian nationality, has been 
with Nestlé since 1989 and was 
previously the Market Head of Nestlé 
Philippines and then the Head of Infant 
Nutrition globally. The Board thanks 
Richard for his contribution over his 
five years at Nestlé and particularly  
for his contribution to the successful 
acquisition and integration of the  
three businesses which enabled Nestlé 
Nutrition to double in size under  
his leadership.
One new director will be proposed 
to shareholders at the 2011 Annual 
General Meeting. Ms. Ann Veneman,  
is a US citizen and former Executive 
Director of the United Nations 
Children’s Fund (UNICEF). She also 
served as Secretary of the United 
States Department of Agriculture 
(USDA) and is a member of the Nestlé 
Creating Shared Value Advisory  
Board, with extensive experience  
in areas such as children’s health  
and education.
The events of the last few years have 
been unprecedented in many ways, 
and have created considerable 
uncertainty for many people in many 
countries around the world. Despite 
this, our people, over 280 000 of them, 
have continued to show a wonderful 
level of commitment to their jobs and 
of enthusiasm for their Company.  
We would like to thank them on behalf 
of the Board and of all our fellow 
shareholders for their efforts in 2010. 
We would also like to welcome all 
those who have joined Nestlé in 2010 
and to wish them every success,  
in the knowledge that they have the  
full support of their colleagues.

Creating Shared Value goals
Nutrition: Using science-based 
solutions, we contribute to the health 
and wellbeing of consumers, including 
those with specific nutritional needs, 
by offering products with higher 
nutritional value at affordable prices 
that appeal to consumers. We also  
aim to generate greater awareness, 
knowledge and understanding  
among consumers through clear, 
responsible communication. 
Water: Our long-term success 
depends on the water resources that 
supply our business operations and 
support the livelihoods of suppliers  
and consumers, which is why water  
is a key focus area of Creating Shared 
Value. We work with stakeholders, 
ranging from agricultural suppliers  
to consumers, to manage water 
consumption in our operations  
and supply chain, and contribute  
to sustainable community water 
management schemes. 
Rural development: We strive  
to increase farmers’ incomes through 
increasing productivity, growing higher 
value crops, using land more efficiently 
and gaining outside farming employment 
and income. We further contribute  
to rural development by providing 
technical and financial assistance and 
access to markets, and by investing  
in factories and rural areas that create 
infrastructure and employment.
Performance 
Nutrition: While nutritional status has 
improved worldwide over the past 
fifty years, malnutrition and obesity  
still require solutions. To ensure both 
taste preference and nutritional 
superiority in our products, we 
assessed CHF 36.4 billion of our 
product portfolio and renovated  
6502 products for nutrition or health 
considerations. To provide lower-
income consumers with greater  
access to affordable food products,  
Creating value  
for society
Compliance with applicable laws 
and international conventions such 
as the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights and strong support 
for the UN Global Compact, as  
well as our internal standards and 
regulations, is the foundation of 
our business. Beyond compliance, 
our business is based on 
sustainability, ensuring our 
activities protect the environment 
for future generations. Yet we 
believe we need to go further, 
creating shared value for both the 
Company and society in areas 
where shareholders’ and society’s 
interests intersect. Three such 
areas – nutrition, water and rural 
development – are the focus  
for this strategy.

The Nescafé Plan
In August 2010, we launched 
The Nescafé Plan, bringing all our 
Creating Shared Value coffee 
farming and production practices 
together. This global initiative will 
help us to optimise our coffee supply 
chain and reach our coffee farming, 
production and consumption 
targets. Under the Plan, we will, 
among other things, invest 
CHF 500 million in coffee projects  
by 2020, distribute 220 million  
high-yield coffee plantlets, train 
30 000 farmers and support  
social projects in coffee-growing 
communities.
Nestlé Prize in  
Creating Shared Value 
In May 2010, the first Nestlé Prize  
in Creating Shared Value was 
presented to International 
Development Enterprises (IDE) 
Cambodia, which employs 
franchised Farm Business Advisors. 
Since 2005, IDE has increased  
the productivity among 
4500 smallholder farmers in rural 
Cambodia, boosting their income 
and increasing their standard of 
living, and the CHF 500 000 prize  
will help IDE to reach an additional 
20 000 farmers.
Healthy Kids Programme
We believe that education helps 
children to understand the value  
of nutrition and healthy lifestyles. 
Building on Nestlé-sponsored 
education programmes, we will 
have implemented our Healthy  
Kids Global Programme through 
partnerships in all countries  
where we have operations by  
the end of 2011.
In Peru, schoolchildren learn about healthy eating in a fun way by participating in Nestlé’s 
Crecer Bien programme. 
we offer 4860 Popularly Positioned 
Products at an affordable cost and 
appropriate serving size through a 
range of locally adapted distribution 
methods. Annually, 90 billion servings 
of Maggi bouillon cubes are fortified 
with key micronutrients to address 
deficiencies in certain markets. 
In 2008, Nestlé’s CEO – and  
those from eight major food and 
beverage companies – made five  
global commitments to the World 
Health Organization’s Director  
General, to tackle obesity and the  
non-communicable diseases 
associated with it through diet and 
physical activity. These commitments 
led to the International Food and 
Beverage Alliance (IFBA), which  
Nestlé has co-chaired since its 
formation, and in November 2009, 
IFBA’s first annual report (see  
www.ifballiance.org) to the Director 
General outlined its members’  
progress to date. 
Water: Water has been identified as 
the most important factor for Nestlé’s 
long-term success, as it affects the 
supply of raw materials, our operations 
and the consumption of many of our 
products. To become the most efficient 
water user in our industry:
•	 Water Resource Reviews are 
conducted at factories and in 
commodity-growing areas; 
•	 we help farmers to become better 
stewards of water;
•	 we support water resource 
awareness and education programmes;
•	 we take a leading role in the global 
dialogue on the issue. 
We have also reduced our total 
water withdrawal by 32% to 
144 million m3 since 2000.
Rural development: We will also 
continue to support 144 926 farmers 
through capacity-building training 
programmes, access to financial 
assistance, farm assessment tools and 
investment in biogas generation, 
amongst others. Full details of our 
performance are given in a 
comprehensive separate report and 
also in more detail on line.
Our people: We continue to offer  
our workforce comprehensive training, 
development and career progression 
opportunities, and our global nutrition, 
health and wellness training 
programme has now reached 
145 922 employees since 2007. Safety 
remained a key focus, our main 
indicator improved by 18% to 4.2 
recordable injuries per million hours 
worked, and relations between 
employees, management and trade 
unions are generally strong.

UN Global 
Compact – 
Communication 
on Progress
Since joining the UN Global 
Compact (UNGC) in 2001, we  
have embraced its 10 principles, 
integrated them into the Nestlé 
Corporate Business Principles  
and continuously supported them.  
Our annual Communication on 
Progress illustrates our dedication 
and efforts in the issue areas of 
human rights, labour practices, the 
environment and anti-corruption. 
Our full Communication on 
Progress is available online.
Commitment and systems
The Nestlé Corporate Business 
Principles (NCBP) – endorsed by the 
Chairman and CEO, and available 
online – form the basis of our culture 
and reflect our values of fairness, 
honesty and respect for people and 
the environment. A revised version  
of the NCBP was developed during 
2010, and translated into fifty 
languages. A comprehensive 
communication and training toolkit 
has been provided to all markets 
where local plans have been launched 
to ensure each employee lives  
up to the Principles. Follow-up 
training is planned in 2011 to ensure 
deeper understanding of each 
Principle. Compliance is monitored 
through external audits under our 
CARE programme, and the Nestlé 
Group Audit function. In 2010, 
392 sites underwent CARE audits  
and no critical non-compliances  
were identified. 
To help maintain our reputation,  
our Code of Business Conduct outlines 
minimum standards of behaviour in 
key areas, our new Employee Relations 
Policy outlines international standards 
and sets a tone of open dialogue on 
labour matters, and the Nestlé Supplier 
Code commits suppliers to comply 
with our core integrity standards. 
Human rights and labour practices
Since November 2008, Nestlé has 
worked with the Danish Institute for 
Human Rights (DIHR), to review our 
human rights policy and assess our 
labour practices and human rights 
compliance. In July 2010, we signed a 
two-year partnership through which the 
DIHR will assist us in integrating human 
rights into our corporate systems, 
undertaking in-depth assessments with 
stakeholder consultations at a country 
level, and other monitoring and 
capacity-building activities.
Nestlé recognises the “corporate 
responsibility to respect human rights”, 
as outlined in the UN Framework on 
Human Rights and Business proposed 
by John Ruggie, Special Representative 
of the UN Secretary General on 
Business and Human Rights. During 
2010, labour rights and human rights 
issues have been discussed by our CEO 
Paul Bulcke with Professor Ruggie, and 
other international stakeholders.
In cocoa-growing areas, child  
labour is a challenge, so Nestlé and 
others in the International Cocoa 
Initiative (ICI) continue to tackle  
child labour and improve access to 
education. In Côte d’Ivoire, the  
Cocoa Plan has a strong child labour 
component, and a new project with the 
ICI will support twenty communities

business. 
In Colombia, Nestlé is a founding 
participant of “Guías Colombia” 
(Guidelines for Colombia), which brings 
together companies, government, 
NGOs and trade unions. We also have  
a formal dialogue with Alliance Sud,  
a group of Swiss NGOs examining the 
impact of our activities and our 
relationships with trade unions and 
local communities on national 
development and human rights.
In 2010, all operating companies 
implemented action plans and are 
tracking progress on our Gender 
Balance initiative, while a network of 
Gender Balance Champions regularly 
shares best practice. Nestlé also 
published Corporate Guidelines for a 
Flexible Work Environment, and paired 
130 senior executives with mentors  
in the second stage of our Corporate 
Mentoring Programme.
In addition, several high-impact 
training and capability workshops  
are being rolled out as part of Nestlé 
Continuous Excellence (NCE) which 
empowers people with the right 
knowledge, skills and competencies  
to drive business results and  
personal development.
Environmental sustainability
Our aim is to continuously improve  
our performance and produce tastier, 
nutritious food and beverages that are 
better for the environment. We assess 
the environmental impact of our value 
chains including procurement, 
logistics, manufacturing, marketing 
and consumer engagement – using  
a life cycle approach.
Through an ongoing commitment  
to operational environmental efficiency 
and a move towards cleaner energy  
we have kept our direct greenhouse gas 
emissions stable at 4 million tonnes 
CO2eq and increased energy 
consumption by only 4% to 88.6 PJ, 
despite an increase in production 
volume of 6.2%. We continue to focus 
on packaging optimisation and two 
additional factories in the UK achieved 
“zero waste to landfill” in 2010. Nestlé

Global Compact’s CEO Water Mandate, 
and has provided a Communication on 
Progress on water since 2009.
We are committed to use only palm 
oil from sustainable sources by 2015 and  
became the first company to commit to 
eliminating tropical rainforest 
deforestation in our supply chain. Through 
our membership of The Forest Trust, we 
are working with our suppliers to meet 
a series of principles to achieve this.
In recognition of our improved 
environmental performance, Nestlé 
was ranked second in the consumer 
goods sector in the Carbon Disclosure 
Project’s (CDP) Carbon Disclosure 
Leadership Index 2010, and contributed 
to the CDP’s Water Disclosure Project.
Anti-corruption
The Code of Business Conduct and  
the NCBP condemn any form of 
corruption and bribery, and our 
Supplier Code of Conduct requires  
our partners to embrace our  
“zero-tolerance” approach. 
Having performed a thorough anti-
corruption risk assessment, we have 
developed an anti-corruption training 
tool to provide employees with specific 
guidance on avoiding inappropriate 
behaviour, supplementing existing 
training efforts in this area. Our Code  
of Business Conduct introduced 
whistle-blower procedures in 2008, 
and we are complementing our  
local hotlines with a Group-wide 
integrity reporting system.

The Nestlé 
Roadmap to 
Good Food, 
Good Life
Our objective is to be recognised  
as the world leader in Nutrition, 
Health and Wellness, trusted by all 
our stakeholders, and to be the 
reference for financial performance 
in our industry. This objective 
demands from our people a blend 
of long-term inspiration, to build 
for the future, and short-term 
entrepreneurial actions, to deliver 
the necessary performance today. 
The 4x4x4 Roadmap combines  
four competitive advantages, four 
growth drivers and four operational 
pillars with the aim of aligning  
the priorities of the more than 
280 000 people who are working  
at Nestlé, and thereby accelerate 
the achievement of our objective.
Premiumisation. Incomes are 
increasing; so is leisure time. These  
are just two trends that point to 
accelerated growth in premium food 
and drinks, each a moment of 
affordable luxury, a moment of 
pleasure. Each of our product 
categories has its own specific 
premium strategy, encompassing 
brands such as Nespresso, S.Pellegrino, 
Perrier, Häagen-Dazs and Cailler.
Our operational pillars are:
Innovation & renovation. Innovation  
is about big steps and changing the 
rules of the game, or even changing 
the game. It is hard to copy. Its rewards 
can be measured by profitable growth 
for years to come and sustainable 
competitive advantages. Renovation  
is more incremental, and lies behind 
the still-growing success of brands 
such as Nescafé and KitKat, both  
over 70 years old.
Operational efficiency seeks to 
ensure that we have the highest quality, 
the lowest cost and best customer 
service. The aim is to improve our 
sustainability by being better, faster, 
more efficient, less wasteful and,  
as a result, higher performing.
Whenever, wherever, however  
is the expression of our aim to have  
our products always at an arm’s reach 
of our consumers. We have created 
specific business models, distribution 
strategies and product solutions  
to meet this objective.
Consumer communication is about 
building trust, exciting consumers,  
and learning from them to help drive 
our R&D. It is about citizenship and 
responsibility and being aligned with 
the expectations of our consumers.
On the following pages we are 
touching in detail on one of each of the 
competitive advantages, the growth 
drivers, and the operational pillars.
All, however, are of equal importance.
Our competitive advantages are:
Our unmatched product and brand 
portfolio, with strong market positions. 
Over 20 Nestlé brands have annual 
sales of over CHF 1 billion. Whether 
global or regional, our brands are 
always relevant to consumers locally.
Our unmatched R&D is the unseen 
impetus behind the growth of our 
brands. It is science-based, consumer-
centric and focused on differentiation 
from our competitors. It goes  
beyond food to cover new products, 
packaging, technology and 
manufacturing, quality and safety.
Our unmatched geographic 
presence has been established over 
many years and is a reflection of both 
the breadth of our presence, with our 
brands available more or less 
everywhere, and the duration for which 
we have been present in countries the 
world over.
Our people, culture, values, and 
attitude enable us to be decentralised 
and entrepreneurial. It combines 
devolved responsibilities with a 
cohesive strategic direction. We are 
patient and not averse to taking 
reasonable risks. Our speed and focus 
enable us to remain competitive in spite 
of any challenges in the marketplace.
Our growth drivers are:
Nutrition, Health and Wellness.  
Each of our product categories, from 
Chocolate to Baby Food, has a specific 
strategy to ensure that it can be the 
nutrition leader in its space.
Emerging markets and Popularly 
Positioned Products. We have tailored  
not just our products, but also our 
business models and marketing mix  
to ensure that we are best able to 
realise the growing opportunity to 
provide nutritious, affordable, branded 
food to lower income consumers 
around the world.
Out-of-home consumption is 
growing faster than in-home. We are 
the largest branded manufacturer, with 
a business built on branded ingredients 
but increasingly achieving new 
standards in customer solutions, 
systems and service.

Japan is its second  
biggest market.

Nestlé’s unmatched global presence  
is the result of the desire, soon after  
the Company was founded, to expand 
beyond domestic borders. The result 
today, is that Nestlé brands have been 
present in many markets, including 
emerging markets, for many 
generations, even over 100 years.  
With this presence come expertise, 
talent, experience, local knowledge 
and traditions that make Nestlé an 
integrated part of those communities 
where it is present.
Nestlé’s sales are broadly spread 
across the world. Our presence in 
emerging markets, with about 
CHF 39 billion of sales, about 36%  
of the total, is an unrivalled platform  
to leverage our scale for a continued 
high level of profitable growth.  
In 2020, by when there will likely be  
an additional one billion consumers  
in emerging markets, we expect  
to be achieving about 45% of Group 
sales in those countries.
In total, our emerging markets 
achieved organic growth of 11.5%  
in 2010. There are 13 emerging markets 
in which Nestlé’s annual sales  
exceed CHF 1 billion, and we have 5 
with over CHF 2 billion in sales.
Our products are ideal for emerging 
markets, especially those that are  
shelf-stable and easily portioned,  
with the potential to be locally 
manufactured: Ambient dairy, Infant 
nutrition, Culinary, Powdered 
beverages, Soluble coffee, Chocolate, 
Ready-to-drink beverages and Water. 
Ice cream and PetCare are growing 
rapidly in the emerging world from 
smaller bases, whilst Frozen and  
Chilled meals do not yet have any 
meaningful presence.
This emerging market business is 
supported by local manufacturing,  
with 47% of our factories in emerging 
markets, local R&D and product 
technology centres, long-term 
relationships with suppliers and 
farmers, and, of course, home-grown, 
local talent working at Nestlé. 
About 80% of the world’s population 
is living in emerging markets, and is 
working for a better future. Nestlé is 
ideally placed both to contribute to that 
better future and to benefit from it.
Nestlé’s presence in the developed 
world is also broad-based. We are  
one of the biggest food companies in 
North America and we have leading 
positions in our key categories in most 
European countries and in Australasia 
and Japan. We believe that there are 
opportunities for profitable growth  
and improved market shares 
everywhere in the developed world.
These opportunities include 
particular channels, market segments 
and consumer groups. They exist  
at the premium end, but also amongst 
lower income consumers, just as  
they do in emerging markets. The 
opportunities are realised through  
a strong pipeline of innovation,  
through increasing distribution, 
through product superiority for both 
taste and nutrition. Also, developed 
markets are often the launch pad  
for innovations that will end up with 
global reach.
Nestlé has a decentralised structure. 
It is our people on the ground in each 
country, who are closest to our 
consumers, who are best able to drive 
our progress locally. They all have  
their own challenges, but they are 
bound together by their alignment  
to our 4x4x4 Roadmap, and they share 
the same objective: to grow our 
business for the benefit of our 
consumers all over the world, of  
our business partners, our people  
and our shareholders.

KitKat celebrated  
its 75th anniversary  
in 2010 but remains 
young and in touch 
with trends, having 
over 2.5 million 
Facebook fans.  
It is sold in over 
70 countries and 
enjoys good growth  
in the developed  
world and emerging 
markets, such as  
the Middle East,  
India and Russia. 
Japan is its second  
biggest market.

Nestlé’s unmatched global presence  
is the result of the desire, soon after  
the Company was founded, to expand 
beyond domestic borders. The result 
today, is that Nestlé brands have been 
present in many markets, including 
emerging markets, for many 
generations, even over 100 years.  
With this presence come expertise, 
talent, experience, local knowledge 
and traditions that make Nestlé an 
integrated part of those communities 
where it is present.
Nestlé’s sales are broadly spread 
across the world. Our presence in 
emerging markets, with about 
CHF 39 billion of sales, about 36%  
of the total, is an unrivalled platform  
to leverage our scale for a continued 
high level of profitable growth.  
In 2020, by when there will likely be  
an additional one billion consumers  
in emerging markets, we expect  
to be achieving about 45% of Group 
sales in those countries.
In total, our emerging markets 
achieved organic growth of 11.5%  
in 2010. There are 13 emerging markets 
in which Nestlé’s annual sales  
exceed CHF 1 billion, and we have 5 
with over CHF 2 billion in sales.
