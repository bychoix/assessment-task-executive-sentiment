Group Chairman’s Statement
The year ahead
The Board is focused on sustaining resilience by 
enhancing reputation and performance. We will 
further develop our strategy to deliver value to  
all of our stakeholders within a governance 
framework that provides stability, prudence 
and effective oversight. 
‘As a well-diversified business underpinned  
by historically stable revenue generation and 
significant capital strength, HSBC is well 
equipped to manage the risks and uncertainty 
inherent in today’s world.’
We expect the world’s major economies to show 
reasonable growth in 2018, helped by relatively 
low unemployment, recovering consumer 
confidence and improving trade. Fears of a  
hard landing in China have receded, and  
markets across Asia look set for a strong year. 
The anticipated conclusion of large regional  
trade agreements in 2018, mostly involving  
Asian nations, also provides cause for optimism. 
With an international network covering 90% of 
global trade flows and a leading presence in the 
world’s fastest growing region, we are in a prime 
position to help our customers capitalise on  
this broad-based global growth.
While we are optimistic about the prospects for 
the global economy, rising international tensions, 
the threat of protectionism and a lack of inclusive 
growth all have the potential to disrupt economic 
activity. We continue to model and anticipate a 
wide range of scenarios as part of our day-to-day 
risk management, to cover unlikely but not 
impossible events. As a well-diversified business 
underpinned by historically stable revenue 
generation and significant capital strength,  
HSBC is well equipped to manage the risks  
and uncertainty inherent in today’s world.

Strategic Report | Group Chairman’s Statement
‘It is important not just to achieve good results, 
but to do so in a way that treats all of our 
stakeholders in a fair and transparent way.’
Transparency and disclosure
Last year, we published a range of environmental, 
social and governance (‘ESG’) metrics to enable 
investors and customers to assess our non-
financial performance. The data we disclose will 
continue to evolve as we learn more about what 
our stakeholders find useful and improve our  
ability to collect the necessary information.  
We will publish our next ESG Update on our 
website in April 2018.
We are also making our first disclosure under the 
terms of the Financial Stability Board’s Task Force 
on Climate-related Financial Disclosures. This  
can be found on page 27. As one of the world’s  
largest international banks, we take seriously  
our responsibility to help develop a voluntary, 
consistent and comparable system of climate-
related financial disclosure. We intend to continue 
to expand and improve the quality and specificity 
of these disclosures, and to encourage all those 
who work with us to do the same. 
Supporting our people
It is important not just to achieve good results,  
but to do so in a way that treats all of our 
stakeholders – employees, customers, regulators 
and shareholders – in a fair and transparent way. 
We are committed to holding ourselves to account 
in meeting that aim, and to being accountable to 
our stakeholders for our actions. 
As part of this commitment, the Board and I are 
determined to ensure that HSBC remains a place 
where all our people have the opportunity to  
fulfil their potential in a nurturing environment  
that encourages the right behaviour. Our 
stakeholders expect honesty and integrity and  
we will continue to promote a culture in which 
people do the right thing. 
My special thanks are due on behalf of the Board 
to each of the 229,000 people who work for HSBC 
around the world. In my short time as Group 
Chairman I have been enormously impressed by 
the effort, energies and ability of our people in 
each country I have visited. These results are a 
testament to their hard work and dedication.

Group Chief Executive’s Review
Group Chief Executive’s 
Review
HSBC is simpler, stronger and more secure than it 
was in 2011, and better able to connect customers to 
opportunities in the world’s fastest growing regions.
Stuart Gulliver Group Chief Executive
2017 was an important year for HSBC. We 
completed the transformation programme that  
we started in 2015, maximising the benefits of  
our network and increasing our competitive 
advantages. By the end of the year we had 
exceeded our risk-weighted asset and cost-saving 
targets, rebuilt our Mexico business, delivered 
revenue growth from our international network  
in excess of global economic growth, and 
accelerated investment in our operations in Asia. 
We also opened new businesses and launched 
products that considerably strengthen the service 
that we offer our international clients. 
These achievements, and the work that preceded 
them, were a critical factor in delivering a strong 
financial performance in 2017. The strength of our 
three main global businesses generated significant 
increases in both reported and adjusted Group 
profit before tax (‘PBT’), while reported PBT also 
benefited from the non-recurrence of a number  
of large significant items from 2016. Adjusted PBT 
and adjusted revenue were up in four out of five 
regions. We grew adjusted revenue faster than 
adjusted costs, and continued to increase our 
market share in strategic product areas. 
Business performance
Retail Banking and Wealth Management had  
an excellent 2017, with strong adjusted revenue 
increases across a number of business lines.  
In Retail Banking, interest rate rises helped to 
grow revenue as our robust balance sheet and 
capital strength continued to attract deposits, 
particularly in Hong Kong. We continued to grow 
lending in our target markets, especially Hong 
Kong, the UK and Mexico. Wealth Management 
benefited from improving customer investment 
appetite, strong product sales across all 
categories and the impact of market movements 
on our life insurance manufacturing businesses.
Commercial Banking adjusted revenue grew well 
on the back of an outstanding performance in 
Global Liquidity and Cash Management. Higher 
lending volumes helped Credit and Lending 
overcome the impact of narrower spreads. Global 
Trade and Receivables Finance revenue stabilised 
after a difficult 2016 and we increased our share 
of major markets, including trade finance in  
Hong Kong and receivables finance in the UK. 
HSBC was voted market leader for trade finance 
in Euromoney’s annual trade finance survey in 
January 2018.
Global Banking and Markets grew adjusted 
revenue, driven particularly by strong growth  
in Global Liquidity and Cash Management,  
and Securities Services. Growth in the first three 
quarters of the year in Markets and Banking 
enabled both to withstand the effects of subdued 
market activity in the fourth quarter.
Global Private Banking adjusted revenue reflected 
the impact of historical repositioning, but was 
stable over the course of 2017. The business grew 
adjusted revenue by 10% in its target markets.
Our strong revenue generation meant that the 
Group achieved positive adjusted jaws in 2017. 
We accelerated investment to grow the  
business, particularly in Retail Banking and  
Wealth Management, which contributed to an  
increase in adjusted costs. Performance-related 
compensation also grew in line with profit  
before tax.

Strategic Report | Group Chief Executive's Review
Adjusted loan impairment charges were 
significantly lower than 2016, mainly due  
to improved conditions in the oil and gas  
industry in North America. 
Our strong common equity tier one ratio of 14.5% 
included the effect of recent changes in US tax 
legislation, which reduced our capital position by  
9 basis points. It also included the impact of our 
most recent $2bn share buy-back. In 2017, we 
returned a total of $3bn to shareholders through 
share buy-backs and paid more in dividends  
than any other European or American bank.  
We achieved this while maintaining one of the 
strongest capital ratios in the industry.
‘We have delivered excellent value to 
shareholders through a total shareholder return 
of 70.3% from 2011 to the end of 2017.’
Strategic actions
The strength of our business is due in large part  
to the strategic actions that we first announced in 
June 2015. This programme concluded at the end 
of 2017 with eight out of ten actions completed on 
time and on target (see pages 12 to 13). 
HSBC is much more capital efficient and capable  
of producing stronger returns for investors as a 
consequence of these actions. Our cost-reduction 
programmes have enabled us to absorb the cost of 
growing the business and protecting HSBC from 
financial crime, while improving the efficiency and 
security of our processes. 
Our previously underperforming Mexico business 
is increasingly profitable and well positioned for 
further growth. Whilst our US business remains  
a work in progress, it is a valuable source of 
business for other regions and continues to make 
important progress. We also completed the run-off 
of our legacy US consumer and mortgage lending 
portfolio, bringing an end to a difficult chapter  
in HSBC’s recent history.
Our international network is now much better  
able to connect customers to opportunities and 
delivering revenue growth above that of the global 
economy. 53% of client revenue now comes from 
international clients, up from 50% in 2015. Global 
Liquidity and Cash Management in particular is 
now a major component of the bank’s success, 
and Global Trade and Receivables Finance has 
extended its leadership of the global trade  
finance market.
The Group’s business mix is more oriented towards 
Asia, improving our ability to channel the economic 
and social changes taking place within the world’s 
fastest growing region. Asia contributes a larger 
proportion of the Group’s profits than in 2015, 
reflecting regional investment in growing our  
loan book, building our insurance and asset 
management businesses, and connecting 
customers to opportunities within the region. 
We continued to expand our presence in mainland 
China with the launch of new retail banking 
products and increased lending in the Pearl River 
Delta. In December we launched HSBC Qianhai 
Securities, the first securities joint venture in 
mainland China to be majority-owned by an 
international bank. This allows us to offer our 
clients increased access to China’s rapidly 
expanding capital markets and provides an 
unprecedented opportunity to establish and grow  
a securities business in mainland China with strong 
international standards. This underlines our status 
as the leading international bank in mainland China. 
We won a number of significant new business 
mandates related to the China-led Belt and Road 
Initiative in 2017, and opened new China desks in 
Poland, Luxembourg, Thailand and Macau to 
capture further opportunities. We now have a  
total of 24 China desks aimed at supporting 
Chinese businesses with global outbound 
ambitions, 20 of which are along the ‘Belt and 
Road’ routes. In November we were named  
‘Best Bank for Belt and Road’ at the FinanceAsia 
Achievement Awards 2017.

Group Chief Executive's Review
‘My sincere thanks go to all of my HSBC 
colleagues around the world, past and present, 
whose hard work and commitment are the 
foundation of the bank’s success.’
Fighting financial crime
For the past five years, we have been weaving 
Global Standards into the fabric of HSBC. The 
investment that we have made in our financial 
crime risk management capabilities has 
considerably strengthened our ability to protect  
the integrity of the financial system. We have 
assembled a highly expert team which is helping  
to shape the debate about our industry’s role in  
the fight against financial crime. We have made 
great strides in building a compliance function fit 
for the many evolving challenges we face, and  
built partnerships to combat financial crime with 
regulatory and law enforcement authorities  
around the world. 
The expiration in December of the five-year 
deferred prosecution agreement that we entered 
into with the US Department of Justice in 2012 
(‘AML DPA’) was an important milestone for HSBC. 
Nevertheless, exiting the AML DPA was a product 
rather than the focus of the essential work that we 
have done to transform our compliance capabilities 
and protect the financial system. This work will 
continue as we seek to ensure that the changes  
we have made are effective and sustainable. 
Combating financial crime is a never-ending 
exercise and will be a constant focus for the 
Group’s management.
Thank you
As I prepare to pass on the stewardship of HSBC 
to my successor, I am proud of our achievements 
of the last seven and a half years. After the most 
extensive transformation programme in HSBC’s 
153 year history, HSBC is simpler, stronger and 
more secure than it was in 2011, and better able 
to connect customers to opportunities in the 
world’s fastest growing regions. We have also 
delivered excellent value to shareholders through 
a higher share price, $64.7bn in declared 
dividends and $5.5bn in share buy-backs, 
representing a total shareholder return of 70.3% 
from 2011 to the end of 2017. 
I am pleased to be handing over to such a 
capable successor as John Flint, whose  
intimate knowledge of HSBC and its culture  
will be a considerable asset to the bank and its 
clients. I am grateful to my colleagues on the 
Group Management Board for their support 
since 2011, and to Douglas Flint and Mark Tucker 
for their backing. 
Finally, my sincere thanks go to all of my HSBC 
colleagues around the world, past and present, 
whose hard work and commitment are the 
foundation of the bank’s success. It has been my 
privilege to work with them for the last 38 years.

Strategic Report
Our strategy
We have developed a long-term strategy that 
reflects our purpose and enables us to capture 
value from our international network.
Two-pronged long-term strategy
Develop our international network
To serve enterprises across geographies and facilitate 
international trade and capital flows, thereby helping our 
clients to grow their business.
Invest in wealth and retail businesses 
with local scale
To make the most of global social mobility, wealth creation 
and long-term demographic changes in our select retail 
banking and wealth management markets.
Value of the network and our strategy
Access to global growth 
opportunities
Our unparalleled network covers 
countries accounting for 
approximately 90% of global GDP, 
trade and capital flows. We have 
a leading presence in large and 
fast-growing economies.
Our network covers all of the world’s 
30 largest trade corridors forecast 
for 2030. These top 30 corridors 
are expected to have a compound 
annual growth rate well in excess 
of GDP growth expectations from 
2016 to 2030.
Lower risk profile and  
volatility from our 
geographically diversified 
universal banking model
We operate a balanced universal 
banking model across both 
wholesale and retail businesses 
and we are geographically 
diversified. This has resulted in a 
lower risk profile and lower earnings 
volatility compared to our global 
peers. Our business model has 
remained resilient through business 
cycles, and it helps ensure stable 
funding and liquidity.
Strong capital and  
funding base
CET1 ratio of 14.5% supported by 
increased shareholders’ equity to 
meet new regulatory requirements 
since the end of 2010.
Four interconnected, global 
businesses share balance sheets 
and liquidity in addition to strong 
commercial links.
Stable shareholder returns
Industry leading dividend – 
approximately $65bn declared 
from 2011 to 2017 – as well as 
circa $5.5bn of share repurchases.

Client examples
Trina Solar (‘Trina’): 
China, renewable 
energy
Exporter of solar panels 
globally. Trina’s aim is to 
bring China’s green energy 
solutions to countries along 
the Belt and Road Initiative 
route, and has thus stepped 
up its overseas investment, 
particularly in the ASEAN 
region. HSBC created a 
digital platform for Trina 
that gave its headquarters 
a transparent view of its 
ASEAN-region subsidiaries’ 
cash positions and set up 
a cash pool in Singapore to 
seamlessly connect Trina’s 
HSBC accounts globally.
Reckitt Benckiser (‘RB’): 
UK, consumer goods
Zhejiang Geely:  
China, automotive
Global consumer health 
and hygiene company. 
HSBC acted as financial 
adviser and lead financier 
to Reckitt Benckiser on  
its $18bn acquisition of 
Mead Johnson Nutrition 
Company, a leader in infant 
and children’s nutrition. 
This acquisition marked 
one of the largest UK into 
US transactions and 
considerably strengthened 
RB’s presence in developing 
markets, particularly China.
Leading automobile 
manufacturer. HSBC served 
as sole financial adviser 
for Zhejiang Geely on two 
interlinked China outbound 
investments, one in 
Malaysian carmaker Proton 
Holdings and the second in 
Lotus Advance Technologies, 
a subsidiary of Proton 
based in the UK. These 
transactions were enabled 
by collaboration between 
HSBC teams in mainland 
China, Hong Kong, 
Singapore, Malaysia  
and London.
Morgan McKinley: 
Ireland, professional 
services
Global recruitment agency 
with operations in Ireland, 
UK, EMEA and APAC. In 
2017, Morgan McKinley 
expanded HSBC’s global 
mandate to include cross-
border Global Trade and 
Receivables Finance 
(‘GTRF’) facilities and 
Global Liquidity and Cash 
Management (‘GLCM’) 
services in Canada and 
Japan. HSBC’s ‘one-team’ 
approach, not separated 
by product, was cited by 
the client as being a key 
driver in the decision to 
switch to HSBC.

Strategic Report
Strategic actions
We met eight out of ten targets from the strategic actions  
outlined in our Investor Update in June 2015.
Capturing value from our international network
In June 2015, we outlined a series 
of strategic actions to make the most 
of our competitive advantages and 
respond to a changing environment.
These actions focused on using our 
resources more efficiently and on 
investing for growth. Each action 
had targets defined to the end of  
2017. The table opposite contains 
a summary of our progress with 
additional details provided below.
Resizing and simplifying 
our business
We passed several significant 
milestones in resizing and simplifying 
our business in 2017. Our 
management actions delivered 
a gross reduction of risk-weighted 
assets (‘RWAs’) by $338bn, exceeding 
our RWA reduction target from 
management initiatives by $60bn 
on an FX-adjusted basis. 
Among our NAFTA region Investor 
Update targets, we did not reach our 
US profit before tax (‘PBT’) target of 
$2bn. However, we have taken steps 
forward in, for example, our US Retail 
Banking and Wealth Management 
(‘RBWM’) business, where we 
increased PBT, revenues and deposits, 
and migrated over one million 
customers to our impending new core 
banking platform. We also completed 
the wind-down of our US consumer 
and mortgage lending (‘CML’) run-off 
portfolio. In Mexico, our adjusted PBT 
reached $440m, surpassing our Investor 
Update target on a local currency 
basis. We also grew adjusted revenue 
in Mexico by 11% compared with 
2016, supported by increased loan 
balances from market share gains. 
We remain on course to complete 
the set-up of our UK ring-fenced bank 
(‘RFB’) ahead of the 1 January 2019 
statutory deadline. In 2017, we 
received a restricted bank licence for 
the RFB and are working through an 
agreed mobilisation plan with the 
Prudential Regulatory Authority and 
Financial Conduct Authority to receive 
an unrestricted licence in 2018.
We successfully concluded our cost-
saving programme and realised $6.1bn 
of annual run-rate savings, over $1bn 
more than our Investor Update target. 
The programme enabled 2017 exit 
run-rate adjusted costs to be kept flat 
compared with the 2014 cost base. 
The savings offset increased costs from 
areas such as regulatory programmes 
and compliance, and investments to 
help facilitate further business growth. 
For example, in RBWM, we expanded 
the use of biometrics globally with 
over 1.5 million customers using voice 
recognition, and with fingerprint 
technology launched in nine of our 
markets. For our corporate customers, 
we improved our key digital channels 
with significant improvements to 
HSBCnet and HSBC Connect. Our  
costs-to-achieve transformation 
concluded with approximately $7bn 
spent since the start of the programme. 
Redeploying capital to grow 
our business
Our international network remains core 
to our strategy, and we achieved our 
Investor Update target of revenue 
growth above GDP. In 2017, we grew 
our revenue from transaction banking 
products by 6%, including double-digit 
percentage growth in GLCM and HSBC 
Security Services (‘HSS’). We grew 
GTRF market share in key markets, in 
particular Hong Kong and receivables 
finance in the UK. Cross-border 
revenues from our priority corridors 
grew 10%, with double-digit percentage 
growth in four of our five largest priority 
corridors including our China-US 
corridor. We were named ‘Top Global 
Trade Finance Bank’ by our clients in the 
Euromoney Trade Finance Survey 2018.
We delivered on our 2015 Investor 
Update commitment to prioritise and 
accelerate investments in Asia. In 2017, 
we grew our loan portfolio in the region 
by $53bn to $426bn. Our asset 
management and insurance businesses 
in Asia realised 17% and 8% growth in 
AUM and annualised new business 
premiums, respectively. In mainland 
China, we reached over 400,000 cards 
in circulation since launching credit 
cards at the end of 2016, and we grew 
our customer loans in the Pearl River 
Delta region by 23%. We launched 
HSBC Qianhai Securities, the first 
securities joint venture in mainland 
China to be majority-owned by an 
international bank.
Revenue tied to renminbi (‘RMB’) 
internationalisation in 2017 of $1.2bn did 
not meet our Investor Update target of 
$2.0bn to $2.5bn. This was largely due 
to a decrease in overall market volumes. 
However, we continue to be recognised 
as the leading bank for international 
RMB products and services. We ranked 
first in Bloomberg’s offshore RMB bond 
underwriting league table in 2017 with 
28% market share and first for the sixth 
year in a row in the Asiamoney Offshore 
RMB Poll 2017. We had the largest 
share, at 53%, of approved quota of 
RMB Qualified Foreign Institutional 
Investor (‘RQFII’) custodian business.

Strategic Report
Financial overview
Reported results
This table shows our reported results for 
the last three years, ended 31 December 
2017, 2016 and 2015.
All commentary in this financial 
overview compares the 2017 results 
with 2016, unless otherwise stated. 
Reported profit before tax 
Reported profit before tax of $17.2bn 
was $10.1bn or 141% higher, mainly 
reflecting a net favourable movement of 
significant items of $8.5bn, which is 
described in more detail on page 32. 
Excluding significant items and an 
adverse effect of foreign currency 
translation of $0.5bn, profit before tax 
increased by $2.1bn or 11%.
Reported revenue
Reported revenue of $51.4bn was 
$3.5bn or 7% higher, partly reflecting a 
net favourable movement in significant 
items of $2.0bn, which included:
 – in 2016, unfavourable fair value 
movements on our own debt designated 
at fair value reflecting changes in our 
own credit spread of $1.8bn, which are 
now reported in other comprehensive 
income, following our partial early 
adoption of IFRS 9 ‘Financial 
Instruments’ on 1 January 2017; and
 – favourable fair value movements in 
2017 of $0.1bn on non-qualifying 
hedges, compared with adverse 
movements of $0.7bn in 2016.
Net favourable movements were partly 
offset by:
 – in 2016, a $0.7bn gain on the disposal 
of our membership interests in Visa 
Europe and Visa Inc. This compared 
with a $0.3bn gain on the disposal of 
our shares in Visa Inc. during 2017;
 – adverse debit value adjustments on 
derivative contracts in 2017 of $0.4bn, 
compared with minimal movements  
in 2016; and
 – in 2017, a $0.1bn provision related to 
customer redress programmes in the 
UK, and a $0.1bn charge arising from 
the opportunity to increase our 
investment in new businesses.

Significant items also included a loss of 
$1.7bn recognised in 2016 on the sale of 
operations in Brazil to Banco Bradesco 
S.A., which was completed on 1 July 
2016. This loss was substantially offset 
by the reported revenue earned by the 
Brazil business during 2016 of $1.5bn. 
Excluding significant items, and an 
adverse effect of foreign currency 
translation of $0.7bn, revenue increased 
by $2.2bn or 5%, reflecting growth in 
Retail Banking and Wealth Management 
(‘RBWM’), Commercial Banking (‘CMB’) 
and Global Banking and Markets 
(‘GB&M’).
Reported LICs
Reported loan impairment charges  
and other credit risk provisions (‘LICs’) 
of $1.8bn were $1.6bn lower, in part 
reflecting the effect of significant items, 
which comprised the LICs incurred  
by our operations in Brazil in 2016  
of $0.7bn.
Excluding significant items and the 
adverse effect of foreign currency 
translation of $0.1bn, LICs decreased  
by $0.8bn or 32%. The reduction in  
LICs was primarily in CMB, RBWM  
and Corporate Centre.
Reported operating expenses
Reported operating expenses of 
$34.9bn were $4.9bn or 12% lower.  
This included a net decrease in 
significant items of $5.6bn, including:
 – a $3.2bn write-off of goodwill in our 
GPB business in Europe in 2016;
 – a net release of $0.4bn in settlements 
and provisions in connection with legal 
matters, compared with charges in 
2016 of $0.7bn;
 – operating expenses of $1.1bn in 1H16 
incurred by the operations in Brazil that 
we sold; and
 – costs to achieve of $3.0bn, compared 
with $3.1bn in 2016.
Excluding significant items and a 
favourable effect of foreign currency 
translation of $0.3bn, operating 
expenses increased by $1.1bn. This 
increase mainly reflected increased 
investment in growth programmes, 
primarily in RBWM, where investments 
were partly funded by the proceeds 
from our disposal of Visa shares,  
and higher performance-related pay.
