Message from  
the Chairman
Peter Coates
Dear Shareholder,
The sustained low oil price environment continues to impact oil 
and gas companies around the globe. Sharp cuts have been made 
to exploration and production programs, supply continues to 
outpace demand and the outlook for stronger global economic 
growth remains at risk. 
Despite the challenging backdrop, our confidence in the long-term 
demand for energy remains strong. Natural gas, in particular, is  
well positioned to benefit from not only a rapidly growing and 
increasingly urbanised global population but also the move toward 
cleaner burning fuels.
Whilst we are confident in the long term demand for energy, the 
volatility exhibited by external markets is beyond our control. Our 
commitment, therefore, is to ensure the company is self-sustaining 
in a low oil price environment, now and into the future. We have 
already implemented significant initiatives to drive costs out, 
improve productivity and ultimately, produce more for less, but 
there is still much to be done. The Board, senior management and 
all employees are committed and engaged to improve efficiencies 
and restore shareholder value. 
Despite the successful delivery of first LNG in September 2015  
from our GLNG project, I accept, that when key LNG investment 
decisions were made, like most in the sector, we did not fully 
anticipate the timing, speed and depth of the down cycle for oil 
prices. Santos, however, is running a long-term business. Over the 
past five years, our multi-billion dollar investments in PNG LNG 
and GLNG were made with this in mind. While they have required 
us to increase our debt level in the short-term, they are by  
no means short-term projects. Any final judgement on the  
success of our LNG strategy should be measured through the  
oil price cycle and not based on the spot price today. 
Looking to the future, one of our key advantages is that our LNG 
assets have low operating costs. They can operate effectively in a 
low oil price environment and will materially benefit shareholders  
as and when market conditions improve. These strategic assets 
are underpinned by world class resources, high quality partners 
and binding long-term offtake agreements that will generate cash 
for decades to come.
The growing demand for energy coupled with the significant cuts 
to investment by oil and gas companies globally is expected to lead 
to a recalibration of oil prices to higher levels. Santos, with its key 
infrastructure position, abundant resources and LNG exposure, is 
well-placed to benefit.
STRENGTHENING THE BALANCE SHEET
In November 2014, the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting 
Countries (OPEC) announced its intention to maintain high levels 
of oil output to protect their market-share against the rise of 
non-OPEC production, particularly shale oil out of the USA. 
Following this announcement, Santos reacted quickly and sought 
to reposition the company for a lower oil price environment.
In December 2014, we announced a 25% reduction to the 2015 
capital expenditure budget and negotiated a $1 billion bilateral bank 
facility to further strengthen our balance sheet. In February 2015  
a recruitment freeze was announced, approximately 500 positions 
were removed from the company, and a 10% reduction in unit 
production costs was targeted over the remainder of the year.
Despite these early initiatives, as the year progressed, it became 
increasingly evident that oil prices were to remain under significant 
pressure for longer than we, and the market, had anticipated. 
OPEC reaffirmed their commitment to maintain high crude output, 
US shale production proved to be unexpectedly resilient, and 
market sentiment continued to be negatively impacted by the 
expectation of higher oil exports from Iran and the risk of lower 
economic growth out of China.

With our major LNG investment 
program behind us, we are now 
firmly focused on becoming a low 
cost producer.
Against this deteriorating external backdrop, on 9 November  
2015, the company announced $3.5 billion of capital initiatives  
to strengthen the balance sheet and reduce net debt.
The first initiative was the sale of Santos’ 35% interest in the 
Kipper gas field, offshore Victoria, for $520 million. Further asset 
sales were considered at this time but the Board determined that 
it was not in the best interests of shareholders to sell tier one 
assets at prices that did not adequately reflect their long-term 
value. 
The second initiative was the $500 million private placement to 
Hony Capital. This was done at a substantial premium to the then 
share price. This share placement to Hony at $6.80 per share 
reflected a clear vote of confidence in Santos’ long-term value 
proposition.
Finally, the decision to raise equity was not taken lightly but 
ultimately, given an external environment characterised by  
extreme uncertainty, it was determined that it was in the best 
interest of shareholders. With strong shareholder support, we 
raised $2.5 billion via a 1 for 1.7 accelerated pro-rata renounceable 
entitlement offer.
As a result of these initiatives, our balance sheet today is much 
stronger. We have retained our investment grade credit rating and 
have a very strong liquidity position with $4.8 billion in cash and 
undrawn debt facilities as at 31 December 2015. The initiatives 
undertaken in 2015 were firmly focused on strengthening the 
company’s balance sheet and we now have a capital buffer to 
reinforce the company through a lower oil price environment.
NEW DIVIDEND POLICY
A revised dividend framework was also announced at this time  
to better reflect the company’s exposure to oil-linked LNG pricing 
and the cyclical characteristics of global oil markets. 
Dividends will now be set as a payout ratio of earnings. Subject to 
business conditions, this is expected to be a minimum of 40% of 
underlying net profit after tax. For the 2015 final dividend, a fully 
franked 5 cents per share dividend was declared.
MANAGEMENT RENEWAL
As a business, we have also started to change the way we  
do things. With our major LNG investment program behind us,  
we are now firmly focused on becoming a low cost producer.  
With this in mind, the Board was pleased to appoint Mr Kevin 
Gallagher as the new Managing Director and CEO. 
Mr Gallagher was previously Chief Executive Officer of the 
engineering services group, Clough Limited and has 25 years’ 
experience managing oil and gas operations in Australia, the  
USA and North and West Africa. He is widely recognised for  
his achievements in driving strong financial performance and  
is ideally suited to lead the company as the focus moves from 
major strategic developments to delivering strong operational 
results in a low oil price environment. Indeed, he has a clear 
mandate from the Board to continue to lower the cost base  
of the company’s operations and ensure Santos is sustainable  
and self-funding at low oil prices.
Mr Gallagher started at Santos on 1 February 2016.

CONFIDENCE FOR THE FUTURE
Finally, in what has been an extremely challenging year, I would  
like to thank you, our shareholders, for your continued support.  
The company has gone through a significant investment phase and 
the focus now is to consolidate the business and drive efficiencies 
to ensure Santos is self-sustaining in a lower oil price environment.  
We have made material and sustainable cost reductions but there  
is a lot more to be done.
In 2016, we are scaling back our short-term investment plans  
on a number of projects as we work through funding priorities  
in response to the lower oil price. Our growth options are 
incremental, low risk and will be prioritised to ensure the best 
return for shareholders. We will continue to refine our strategy  
and update the market in due course.
We can be confident in the strong and growing demand for energy 
and our portfolio of high-quality assets is well placed to benefit. 
We are determined to restore and maximise shareholder value.
PETER COATES
Chairman

Introducing
Kevin Gallagher,  
Managing Director  
and Chief Executive Officer
Kevin joined Santos as Managing Director and Chief 
Executive Officer on 1 February 2016. 
Kevin is a senior executive with more than 25 years’ 
experience in managing oil and gas operations in Australia, 
the USA and North and West Africa.
A qualified mechanical engineer, Kevin commenced his 
career as a drilling engineer with Mobil North Sea Ltd, 
before joining Woodside Petroleum Ltd in 1998. During a  
13 year tenure with Woodside, he led the drilling organisation 
through rapid growth, delivering several Australian and 
international development projects and exploration 
campaigns. In his last role he was accountable for profit 
and loss on Australia’s largest resource project, the North 
West Shelf, where he held the positions of Executive Vice 
President, North West Shelf Business Unit and CEO of  
the North West Shelf Venture.
Appointed Managing Director and CEO of Clough Ltd in 
2011, Kevin implemented strategies that transformed the 
business. He established a strong leadership team, improved 
cost and operational performance and delivered record 
financial results. He oversaw the development of innovative 
programs to improve safety and drive productivity and 
executed an M&A and international expansion strategy 
which saw Clough enter five new regions including the  
US, UK, Canada, Africa and Asia.
In 2013 Kevin was recognised by Australia’s CEO Magazine 
as the CEO of the Year, and the Energy and Resources 
Executive of the Year.
4 / Santos Annual Report 2015
Dear Shareholder,
Since joining Santos two months ago I have focused my efforts on 
getting up to speed to understand the issues and the opportunities 
across our portfolio of assets. I am working hard to develop a clear 
strategy for the future and am determined to build an organisation 
with a reputation for delivering what we promise.
There is no question that lower oil prices present significant 
challenges to the oil and gas industry, to Santos and to you, our 
shareholders. The dynamics of supply and demand have brought 
into stark reality the need to ensure that our assets are operated  
in a disciplined and efficient manner.
If we look at the 2015 production and safety results, operationally 
we have a lot to work with. What cannot be ignored, however, is 
the steep decline in the oil price and the impact this is having on 
our business. It is clear that we must do better. 
Production of 57.7 million barrels of oil equivalent in 2015 was the 
company’s highest in seven years, underpinned by a full-year of 
production from PNG LNG, the start-up of GLNG in the third 
quarter and record annual production from Darwin LNG. 
The first cargo departed GLNG in October and marked a significant 
milestone in a project that is set to run for decades to come. Train 1 
production has regularly exceeded 10% above nameplate capacity 
and as at the end of February 2016 the project had produced 
approximately 1.2 million tonnes of LNG and shipped 18 cargoes.
The PNG LNG project shipped 101 cargoes in 2015 as strong 
upstream deliverability and reliable plant performance resulted  
in the plant operating 7% above its nameplate capacity at an 
annualised rate of 7.4 million tonnes per annum.
We recorded some exploration success in 2015, announcing  
a significant oil discovery in March 2015 from the Bestari-1 
exploration well located offshore Malaysia. Further, in the Cooper 
Basin, the first stand-alone Permian Source Rock play producer, 
the Tirrawarra South-1 well, was successfully brought online in  
May and is flowing liquids-rich gas in line with forecasts.

--- Page 7 ---
I am working hard to develop 
a clear strategy for the future 
and am determined to build an 
organisation with a reputation  
for delivering what we promise.
Despite this operational performance, a net loss of $2.7 billion  
was reported, reflecting after tax impairments of $2.8 billion.  
The impairment charges are primarily a result of the current  
lower oil price environment. The impairment charge is an 
accounting adjustment that relates to the historical book  
value of the company’s assets.
The impairment charge was attributed predominantly to the 
company’s Cooper Basin, GLNG and Gunnedah Basin assets. 
Although the lower oil price has resulted in a reduction of  
capital expenditure and the deferral of field development plans,  
we remain committed to meeting our contractual obligations  
from the Cooper Basin and the GLNG project, and will continue  
to progress the evaluation and approvals processes for the 
Narrabri Gas opportunity.
EBITDAX1 of $1.9 billion was down 17% on the previous year 
despite the oil price declining by almost 50%. Underlying net  
profit after tax was $50 million, 91% lower than the prior year,  
a result again impacted by the weak oil price. Operating cash  
flow was strong at $1.1 billion, due in part to the defensive  
nature of our domestic gas assets.
Over the course of 2015 we reduced capex by 54%, cut 825 
employee positions across the company and secured $230 million  
in savings across the supply chain. Unit production costs were down 
10% to $14.40 per barrel of oil equivalent. We remain committed  
to further driving costs out of the business and working closely 
with our joint venture partners to improve efficiencies. 
These savings can only be achieved through the hard work  
of all of our teams, and are reflective of a new mind-set where 
producing more for less is expected. We have made a significant 
start, but we are certainly not done and we must continue to 
improve our performance.
It is vital that we continue to take costs out of our business.  
My first priority and absolute focus is to look closely at our 
operations. I am scrutinising our portfolio of assets and the 
structure and processes that we have in place to manage them.  
I am working hard to develop the right management team, the 
right strategy and the right culture to make Santos self-sustaining 
in a low oil price environment and well positioned to take full 
advantage of rising commodity prices in the future.
We must continue to adapt to changing market conditions. 
Change is required if we are to stay competitive and I will be 
working quickly to identify further actions that are essential  
to effectively manage the business.
In a period of significant operational and cultural change, it  
was pleasing to see in 2015 the company record its best safety 
performance on record with a Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate 
(LTIFR) of 0.1 per million hours worked. We must, however, remain 
vigilant across all of our operations to ensure everyone goes home 
without injury. In addition, we were recognised for our sustainable 
operations and placed in the top 10% of the leading 2,500 
companies globally by the Dow Jones Sustainability Index. 
Companies are selected for inclusion in the index based on a 
comprehensive assessment of long-term economic, environmental 
and social criteria. For further information I would encourage you 
to read our 2015 Sustainability Report, available on our website at 
www.santos.com/sustainability
I look forward to the challenges ahead and will update you on the 
progress we make in due course. 
This is a great company with a great history. It’s an incredible 
honour for me to lead and serve this company and I have high 
expectations that Santos will emerge from this period a stronger 
and more sustainable business.
