Letter From Your CEO
2016 was a year of tremendous transformation for Intel as we took important, and in some 
cases difficult, steps to accelerate our evolution from a PC company to one that powers the 
cloud and billions of smart, connected computing devices. We restructured the company  
while also launching exciting new products, successfully integrating Altera, and investing  
for growth. Our results provide evidence that our strategy is working and delivering strong 
returns to our shareholders.
Intel reported record full-year revenue of $59.4 billion, up 7% from 2015 with the addition of 
Altera and strength across the business. The Data Center Group achieved record revenue and 
volume driven by continuing strong demand from cloud service providers, the ramp of new, 
adjacent products, and big gains in networking. Our Internet of Things Group also achieved 
record revenue and volume with impressive design wins in video, retail, and automotive. And, despite a decline in 
the PC market, the Client Computing Group grew revenue and profitability through strong execution, a robust 
segmentation strategy, a rich mix of Intel® Core™ processors, and volume modem shipments. 
In 2016, we also reshaped the company in several important ways. We successfully integrated Altera (now Intel’s 
Programmable Solutions Group), which grew and delivered new products during integration. We announced plans  
to divest Intel Security and establish it as a separate company in order to increase our focus while participating in 
the new McAfee’s future success. We also initiated an Intel-wide restructuring program, and made several executive 
leadership changes that brought some of the most seasoned technology veterans to Intel. All together, these 
transformative efforts have aligned the company around the greatest opportunities for growth driven by one of  
the most significant changes I’ve seen in business—data.
Data is the lifeblood of every industry working to reinvent itself in the modern age. Companies that use data will 
thrive and grow; companies that don’t will fall behind. This data revolution is a big opportunity for Intel because we 
provide essential technologies for processing, analyzing, storing, and sharing data. Data fuels our virtuous cycle of 
growth. It drives the continuing build-out of the cloud and the transformation of networks, and enables amazing 
new computing experiences like artificial intelligence, autonomous driving, and merged reality. The growth of data 
and new data-intensive markets adds billions to Intel’s total addressable market.
While our business undergoes significant changes to capture these growth opportunities, we are not changing  
Intel’s commitment to operate responsibly and with transparency. We continue our efforts to advance diversity  
and inclusion, environmental sustainability, supply chain responsibility, and social impact. We also continue our 
relentless pursuit of Moore’s Law, which remains foundational to our strategy and our technology leadership.
In 2017, Intel is focused on four priorities: accelerating growth in the data center; keeping the client business healthy 
and strong; extending our growth in the Internet of Things; and flawlessly executing the launch and ramp of our 
memory technologies and programmable solutions. We made excellent progress in 2016. Our work continues with  
a very clear picture of how, as a data company, Intel will drive long-term value for our shareholders.
Brian M. Krzanich, Chief Executive Officer

Letter From Your Chairman
Financial Results
Evaluating whether Intel’s business is properly managed 
for long-term value is one of the primary responsibilities  
of the Board of Directors. In technology companies, 
long-term value comes from continuing innovation.  
The cycle of investment, innovation, and value would not 
be sustainable without profits. Today’s profits finance 
tomorrow’s innovation.
Two measures of success are especially important to me  
as a stockholder and your Chairman. Intel generated cash 
flow from operations in 2016 of $22 billion and return on stockholders’ equity  
of 16%. This caps five years in which cash from operations averaged over $20 
billion and return on stockholders’ equity averaged over 19%. These figures 
indicate the intrinsic health of the business and the value created over time with 
stockholders’ money.
In 2016 the Board continued to work on how best to capture opportunities and 
enhance returns for the owners. The company has made progress in directing 
more resources to growing and emerging businesses and fewer to mature, less 
profitable, or less strategic businesses. Most of the research and development 
spending goes to technical capabilities and intellectual property used by more 
than one business group. These shared investments provide a foundation that is 
an important and productive feature of Intel’s business model.
In considering how and where to deploy capital, the Board begins with a review 
of the business and critical needs. The largest portion of Intel’s 2016 capital 
investment of $9.6 billion was used to build and equip what we expect will be the 
most advanced wafer fabrication facilities in the world, on the forefront of 
Moore’s Law. These manufacturing marvels will rely on process technology that 
allows us to optimize performance, cost, and power consumption across our 
product line.
The Board typically looks at acquisitions as a way of adding capabilities more 
quickly or better than the company could do with internal resources. The Board 
evaluates projected returns as part of the acquisition decision process. Once the 
investments have been made, the Board monitors performance. Most of the 
transactions Intel pursues target specific technologies or expertise. In addition  
to the acquisition of Altera, Intel completed 11 other acquisitions in 2016 for 
total consideration, net of cash acquired, of $1.1 billion, consistent with the 
number of transactions and levels of investment in 2015 and 2014. The Board 
will occasionally consider large transactions, such as Altera, that offer new and 
significant opportunities.
After providing for the needs of the business, the Board considers cash policy 
and return to stockholders. In 2016, Intel paid $4.9 billion in dividends and 
repurchased $2.6 billion in stock, for a total return to stockholders of $7.5 billion. 
Over the last five years, Intel has returned a cumulative total of $54.4 billion to 
stockholders in dividends and stock repurchases.
Culture and continuity are important to success. Behind the results of 2016  
is a strong and resilient culture with talented and dedicated employees. The 
Board is grateful to employees for their sustained focus and execution in a  
time of change. 
Intel’s founders were highly motivated by the knowledge that silicon technology 
could change the way people live. Today, Intel employees continue to share  
that pride. Intel approaches its 50th anniversary in 2018 with optimism about 
the potential for technology and confidence in the business that makes  
innovation possible.
