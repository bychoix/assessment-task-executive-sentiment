Message from the President
The President thanks our customers for support during a challenging environment, announcing our Global Vision efforts and our 
aim to be “A Company Selected By Customers.” Human life is our top priority, so relief and regional recovery came first in the 
aftermath of the earthquake. Next, we set about restarting production, deploying the awesome power of superior “on-the-spot” 
efforts for rapid production normalization. We are holding our course toward sustained growth amidst challenging circumstances.
Toyota Global Vision
Our  new  vision  clarifies  the  kind  of  company  Toyota  seeks  to  be  and  our  course  for  realizing  a  “regional  initiative”  structure  for 
sustained growth. We aim for coexistence and co-prosperity with customers and society by building better cars and creating good 
communities and a good society, providing earnings for a stable business/earnings foundation (consolidated operating margin 5% 
on unit sales of 7.5 million, ¥85/US$1 (operating income approx. ¥1 trillion) and nonconsolidated operating income profitability).
Special Feature: Toyota’s Safety Technology
Toyota  seeks  to  offer  products  that  exceed  customer  expectations  for  safety  and  quality,  and  is  working  to  contribute 
to  achieving  zero  traffic  injuries  and  fatalities,  which  is  the  ultimate  goal  of  the  mobility  society.  We  introduce  the  three 
perspectives  we  take  in  striving  to  provide  the  world’s  highest  level  of  safety:  Our  basic  safe  philosophy,  the  leading-edge 
technologies we employ to achieve safer vehicles, and future direction of safety technologies.
New Business: Toyota’s Smart Grid Efforts
Realizing  the  “future  mobility  society”  conceived  in  our  new  vision  requires  the  broad  acceptance  of  next-generation 
environmentally-friendly vehicles. We introduce the smart grids that will provide the infrastructure to make this possible, giving 
an outline of the overall concept and discussing the trials that will lead to their realization and ties with other companies, such 
as Microsoft, that will speed up the process.
New Management Structure
We  revamped  our  management  structure  on  April  1,  2011,  so  as  to  achieve  our  new  vision.  We  introduce  structures  for 
making  prompt  management  decisions  based  on  onsite  information  and  customer  opinions  and  creating  a  structure  for 
management that is closely attuned to what is happening at actual sites.
Outline of Results and Future Prospects: Message from the Executive Vice President Responsible for Accounting
During  the  fiscal  2011  we  bounced  back  from  challenging  circumstances  to  produce  results  showing  improved  earnings 
and  profits.  We  will  continue  toward  the  goal  set  forth  in  our  Global  Vision  of  building  consistent,  solid  profitability  in 
nonconsolidated  operating income, with a consolidated operating  margin of  5% and operating income  of around ¥1  trillion, 
even under such severe conditions as an exchange rate of ¥85/US$1 and consolidated unit sales of 7.5 million.
