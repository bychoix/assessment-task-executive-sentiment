Dear Fellow Shareholders,
Jamie Dimon,  
Chairman and  
Chief Executive Officer
Seven years ago, the world was shaken by the global financial crisis. And since then, 
our company has been dealing with extraordinary challenges as a result of that crisis. 
We have endured an unprecedented economic, political and social storm — the impact 
of which will continue to be felt for years and possibly decades to come. What is 
most striking to me, in spite of all the turmoil, is that our company became safer and 
stronger — and it never stopped supporting clients, communities and the growth of 
economies around the world. 
I feel extraordinarily privileged to work for this great company with such talented 
people. Our management team and our employees do outstanding work every single 
day — sometimes under enormous pressure — while dealing with an extreme number 
of complex business and regulatory issues. The way our people and our firm are 
able to address our challenges and admit our mistakes while continuing to grow our 
businesses and support our clients fills me with pride.

Our company earned a record $21.8 billion in net income on revenue1 of $97.9 billion in 
2014. In fact, we have delivered record results in the last four out of five years, and we 
hope to continue to deliver in the future. Our financial results reflected strong underlying 
performance across our businesses. Over the course of last year, our four franchises 
maintained — and even strengthened — our leadership positions and continued to gain 
market share, improve customer satisfaction and foster innovation. We also continued 
to deliver on our many commitments — including business simplification, regulatory 
requirements, controls, expense discipline and capital requirements.

Tangible book value over time captures the company’s use of capital, balance sheet and profitability. In this chart, we are looking at 
heritage Bank One shareholders and JPMorgan Chase & Co. shareholders. The chart shows the increase in tangible book value per share; 
it is an aftertax number assuming all dividends were retained vs. the S&P 500 (a pretax number with dividends reinvested).
(a) On March 27, 2000, Jamie Dimon was hired as CEO of Bank One
We believe that, in 2014, we continued to deliver for our shareholders. The table above 
shows the growth in tangible book value per share, which we believe is a conservative 
measure of value. You can see that the tangible book value per share has grown far 
more than the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (S&P 500) in both time periods. For Bank 
One shareholders since March 27, 2000, the stock has performed far better than most 
financial companies and the S&P 500. And since the JPMorgan Chase & Co. merger with 
Bank One on July 1, 2004, we have performed well versus other financial companies 
and slightly below the S&P 500. The details are shown in the table below.

However, our stock performance has not been particularly good in the last five years. 
While the business franchise has become stronger, I believe that legal and regulatory 
costs and future uncertainty regarding legal and regulatory costs have hurt our 
company and the value of our stock and have led to a price/earnings ratio lower 
than some of our competitors. We are determined to limit (we can never completely 
eliminate them) our legal costs over time, and as we do, we expect that the strength 
and quality of the underlying business will shine through.
JPMorgan Chase continued to support consumers and businesses and make a 
significant positive impact on our communities. In 2014, the firm provided credit 
and raised capital of more than $2.1 trillion for our clients. The firm also has hired 
nearly 8,700 military veterans since 2011 as a proud founding member of the 100,000 
Jobs Mission, which recently has increased the goal to 300,000 jobs. Our firm was 
there to help small businesses — we provided $19 billion of credit to U.S. small 
businesses, which allowed them to develop new products, expand operations and 
hire more workers. In total, we provided $197 billion of credit to consumers. And 
we provided credit and raised capital of more than $75 billion for nonprofit and 
government entities, including states, municipalities, hospitals and universities. 
Our strength allows us to be there for our clients and communities in good times — 
and, more important, in bad times. In the face of many difficult challenges, we never 
stopped doing our job, and we demonstrated that the work we do matters. And we also 
continue to build our business by investing in infrastructure, systems, technology and 
new products and by adding bankers and branches around the world.

In this letter, I will discuss the issues highlighted below. I also encourage you to read 
the letters written by several of our business leaders about our main businesses, our 
critical operations and controls, and some of our corporate responsibility efforts. 
As usual, this letter will describe some of our successes and opportunities, as well as 
our challenges and issues. The main sections of the letter are as follows: 
I.  We have an outstanding franchise — our company has emerged as an endgame 
winner, but we need to earn it every day 
II.  We build for the long term — we manage through-the-cycle, and we always are 
prepared for the toughest of times
III.  We will successfully navigate the new global financial architecture (and we are 
well on our way to having fortress controls)
IV.  We have a solid strategy and believe our future outlook is very good — but, as 
usual, there still are a lot of things to think and worry about 
V.  We have a fully engaged board, an exceptional management team and a strong 
corporate culture

I. WE HAV E AN  OUTSTA NDI NG   FRA N C H I S E  —   O UR

BUT WE NEE D TO E ARN  I T EVE RY   DAY
If you think back 10, 20 or 30 years ago, my 
predecessors and I struggled to try to build 
a great company, which we hoped would 
emerge as an endgame winner. The ultimate 
outcome was unclear – and many competitors 
did not survive (this is true for most large-
scale consolidating industries). Even for those 
of us that did, it was quite a struggle. Today, 
it is clear that our company is an endgame 
winner – both in the United States and glob-
ally – which is invaluable in any industry. And 
while we have had some difficult times since 
the financial crisis, the power of the franchise 
has shone through. We also know that future 
success is not guaranteed – only consistently 
good management over a long period of time 
can ensure long-term success in any business. 
But we certainly are in a very good place.
We have delivered good multi-year financial 
results (strong margins and returns and 
low volatility) and have shown a great 
ability to adapt to changes — both from the 
marketplace and the regulatory environment
We always compare our margins and returns 
with those of our best competitors in each 
business. The chart below, which is very 
similar to a chart we showed at our Investor 
Day, shows some of these numbers for 2014. 
We believe that the right discipline is to 
compare each of our businesses against its 
best competitor. It is a mistake just to look 
at the consolidated numbers and compare 
them – every company has a different mix of 
businesses. The chart below also shows how 
our businesses compare in terms of margins,

Even our annual Retail National Sales 
Conference with the top 5% of our branch 
bankers, loan officers and tellers is critical – 
we spend time working together, we learn 
a lot and we get to thank these outstanding 
employees at an awards recognition dinner. 
While it is perfectly reasonable in tough 
times to dramatically reduce the cost of that 
conference, it is unwise to cancel it. I have 
been to every single one of these events since 
I started running Bank One, and I intend to 
continue that tradition.
We earned adequate returns while building an 
increasingly stronger capital base
During these challenging years, our company 
has confronted difficult markets, billions of 
dollars of additional regulatory costs, billions 
of dollars of costs due to changes in prod-
ucts and services, and, unfortunately, very 
high legal costs. And we have had to hold 
an increasing amount of capital throughout 
this time. While there is no question that 
these events did reduce our performance and 
returns, we have been able to adapt, meet the 
new rules and perform fairly well financially.
our target margins in a normal environment 
and, most important, our return on equity 
(ROE). On most of these measures, we are 
very close to the best-in-class competitor. 
A good company should be able to earn 
competitive margins over an extended period 
of time regardless of economic conditions while 
investing and without taking excessive risk
Any company can improve earnings in the 
short run by taking on additional risk or 
cutting back on investments. Any company 
can grow rapidly if it takes on too much 
risk – but that usually is the kind of growth 
one comes to regret. Our margins have been 
quite good, even as we have been investing 
for the long run. These investment expenses 
lower our short-term returns, but they 
are “good” expenses. In addition to the 
tremendous amount that we invest annu-
ally in technology and infrastructure, some 
examples of where we have invested over 
the past five years are: 
–  448 retail branches in the United States 
–  28 wholesale offices abroad 
–  2,498 Chase Private Client locations/
branches, supported by 594 new Private 
Client advisors 
–  20 Commercial Banking expansion cities, 
including approximately 350 Commercial 
Banking bankers 
–  205 small business bankers
A good company always should be investing 
while it also is waste cutting; i.e., cutting 
out any unnecessary expenses. However, 
I often have received bad advice on what 
are unnecessary expenses. For example, 
spending on important strategic off-sites, 
research and development for innovation, 
marketing that has a positive return – those 
are good expenses. We take a bus trip annu-
ally to visit branches, operating centers 
and clients. It is both fun and enormously 
productive – and it is not an unnecessary 
expense – it makes us a better company.

The chart below also shows that even 
after dramatically increasing capital and 
liquidity, both of which reduce returns on 
capital, we were able to earn an adequate 
return on tangible common equity, grow 
our capital base as needed and still return 
capital to shareholders. 
The chart below shows earnings, the capital 
we returned to shareholders through divi-
dends and stock buybacks, our returns 
on tangible common equity and our high 
quality liquid assets (HQLA). High quality 
liquid assets essentially are deposits held 
at the Federal Reserve and central banks, 
agency mortgage-backed securities and 
Treasuries, and they are the component 
of our balance sheet that has grown most 
dramatically. Only HQLA count for liquid 
assets under banking regulators’ definition of 
liquidity – and we currently have more than 
is required by the regulators.

For footnoted information, refer to slides 11 and 50 in the 2015 Firm Overview Investor Day presentation, which is available on JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s website at  
(http://investor.shareholder.com/jpmorganchase/presentations.cfm), under the heading Investor Relations, Investor Presentations, JPMorgan Chase 2015 Investor Day,  
Firm Overview, and on Form 8-K as furnished to the SEC on February 24, 2015, which is available on the SEC’s website (www.sec.gov). Further, for footnote 20,  
CAGR represents compound annual growth rate
Our businesses have been able to gain market 
share, which only happens when we are 
creating happy clients 
Importantly, much of the growth has been 
organic. Please review some of the numbers in 
the chart above – they speak for themselves. 
If you had asked me back in 2006 if we could 
have accomplished those kinds of market 
share numbers, I would have been skeptical. 
And, fortunately, we have plenty of areas 
where we still can grow or do better – I will 
talk about this in a later section of this letter.
Most of our businesses have exhibited improving 
customer satisfaction 
The chart on the next page shows the great 
progress that our Consumer Bank has made 
in improving satisfaction scores. In fact, 
American Customer Satisfaction Index 
named Chase #1 in customer satisfaction 
among large banks in 2014. We have received 
even better scores than most of the regional 
banks and essentially are equal in ranking to 
the midsized banks. (We still are not satis-
fied, however, and want to be even better.) 
We believe that our customer satisfaction 
has been going up for multiple reasons: error 
rate reduction, better products and services, 
good old-fashioned service with a smile, and, 
importantly, innovations like deposit-friendly 
ATMs and continual improvement in online 
and mobile banking services. While the chart 
shows satisfaction in the Consumer Bank, we 
also have had increasing customer satisfac-
tion scores in our small business, mortgage, 
auto finance and credit card franchises.

Our mix of businesses works for clients — and 
for shareholders
All companies, including banks, have a 
slightly different mix of businesses, products 
and services. The most critical question is, 
“Does what you do work for clients?” Our 
franchise does work for clients by virtue of 
the fact that we are gaining share in each of 
our businesses, and it works for shareholders 
by virtue of the fact that we are earning 
decent returns – and some of our competi-
tors are not.
Other considerations are whether your 
company has “moats” – is it protected in 
some way from debilitating competition or 
events? And has it performed consistently 
– in good times and in bad? We believe that 
we have well-fortified moats in the form of 
economies of scale, brand, expertise, tech-
nology and operations, and – importantly – 
competitive advantages created by our ability 
to cross sell (more on this later in this letter). 
In addition, we have performed fairly consis-
tently in good times and in bad. Even in 
2008, the worst year in perhaps 75 years for 
financial companies, we earned 6% return 
on common tangible equity – not great but 
not bad, all things considered. Additionally, 
we have embedded strengths that are hard to 
replicate – the knowledge and cohesiveness 
of our people, our long-standing client rela-
tionships, our technology and product capa-
bilities, our fortress balance sheet and our 
global presence in more than 100 countries.
Our mix of businesses leads to effective cross 
sell and substantial competitive advantages. 
We are not a conglomerate of separate, 
unrelated businesses — we are an operating 
company providing financial services to 
consumers, companies and communities
A conglomerate is a group of unrelated busi-
nesses held under one umbrella holding 
company. There is nothing wrong with 
a conglomerate, but we are not that. In 
our case, whether you are an individual, a 
company (large or small) or a government, 
when you walk in the front door and talk 
with our bankers, we provide you with essen-
tial financial products, services and advice. 
We have a broad product offering and some 
distinct capabilities, which, combined, create 
a mix of businesses that works well for each 
of our client segments.
