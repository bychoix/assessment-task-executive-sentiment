Significant investment in technology and process 
redesign is now not only delivering greater cost 
efficiency but also is poised to markedly enhance 
our ability to detect and prevent financial crime.  
In addition, 2017 will see the progressive launch  
of applications that will materially improve our 
customers’ digital experience, enhance their  
online security and bring greater personalisation  
of product offerings.
While there is still a long way to go, it was 
encouraging to see the significant improvement  
in performance across all business units in  
Mexico following the substantial repositioning  
of the Group’s operations there. This contributed  
to the Group’s success in replacing substantially  
all of the revenues given up through continuing 
run-off of legacy portfolios, risk mitigation in  
areas exposed to higher threat of financial crime 
and reduction in trading books.
Furthermore, HSBC is safer today from the threat 
of financial crime because of the investments  
we have been making in our Global Standards 
programme. The Board remains fully committed  
to our work in this area in 2017 and beyond.
Regulatory matters
It was extremely disappointing that the regulatory 
community was unable to achieve its targeted 
completion of the Basel III framework in January 
2017 on the consensual basis expected. It is now 
almost 10 years since the commencement of the 
global financial crisis and it is time to draw a line 
under further regulatory changes, particularly since 
there is no doubt that our industry is more strongly 
capitalised, better governed and more risk aware 
than it was a decade ago. Finalisation of the 
structure and calibration of the capital framework 
is crucial to give banks certainty over prospective 
capital allocations in support of lending and market 
activities. This is particularly important at this time 
when public policy is focusing on encouraging 
greater support for longer-dated assets, including 
infrastructure, and seeking to build out the capital 
markets of Europe and emerging markets. It is 
hugely important that regulators and policy makers 
now move as quickly as possible to finalise the 
capital framework in line with their stated 
commitment to deliver that framework without  
a significant, broad-based increase in capital 
requirements. Equally important is the avoidance  
of fragmentation in the global regulatory 
architecture as the new US administration 
reconsiders its participation in international 
regulatory forums. The best outcome would be 
early global agreement on unresolved issues, 
followed by an extended period of regulatory 
stability to allow familiarity and experience to be 
gained from what has been put in place. 
We made further progress in 2016 on completing 
the resolution planning required of us as a global 
systemically important bank (‘G-SIB’). This involved 
removing or mitigating residual constraints on the 
clarity of the Group’s core college of regulators’ 
approach to winding down the Group, should  
this ever be necessary. While clearly we do  
not envisage such circumstances as other  
than extremely remote, completion of a  
comprehensive resolution framework is a 
necessary pillar supporting HSBC’s ability to 
continue to operate as one of the world’s G-SIBs. 
Indeed, our strategy is built around maintaining  
the scale and the reach of our international 
network, which in 2016 again demonstrated its 
resilience and competitive advantages.
Tangible benefits accrue to our shareholders  
from the detailed work done with our regulators  
to demonstrate the strength of our capital position 
and the effectiveness of our resolution planning. 
Beyond supporting the maintenance of our 
dividend, in 2016 management’s efforts created 
the capacity to return capital to shareholders  
by way of a share buy-back and demonstrated 
justification for a reduction in the additional  
capital buffer applied to HSBC as a G-SIB.
UK referendum on EU membership
Not a great deal has changed since we reported  
at the interim stage, given that the UK has still to 
trigger its formal exit notice and so no negotiations 
have taken place. We welcomed, however, the 
additional clarity given to the Government’s 
position in the recent speech by the Prime Minister. 
The scale of the challenge of negotiating across the 
entire economic landscape, as well as addressing 
the legislative and other public policy adjustments 
that will be required, has become clearer. We 
believe there is now, as a consequence, a widely 
shared recognition that an implementation phase 
between the current position and the one that  
is ultimately negotiated will be necessary; we 
strongly endorse this view. 
Since the referendum we have focused on  
advising clients on the implications of leaving  
the EU for their businesses. We have also been 
responding to UK Government outreach seeking 
guidance on which elements of the current 
EU-based legal and regulatory arrangements  
it should focus on to preserve the essential role 
that financial markets based in the UK play in 
supporting European trade and investment activity.
For our own part, we have broadly all the licences 
and infrastructure needed to continue to support 
our clients once the UK leaves the EU. This largely 
derives from our position in France where we  
are the sixth largest bank with a full range of 
capabilities. Current contingency planning suggests 
we may need to relocate some 1,000 roles from 
London to Paris progressively over the next two 
years, depending on how negotiations develop.

Strategic Report | Group Chairman’s Statement
Board changes
We welcomed Jackson Tai to the Board on  
12 September last year. Jack brings a rare 
combination of hands-on banking expertise,  
top level governance experience and a deep 
knowledge of Asia and China. These attributes 
were accumulated in a 25-year career at  
J.P. Morgan & Co., both in the US and in Asia,  
and subsequently in senior roles at DBS, the 
leading Singapore-based regional banking group, 
where Jack latterly led its regional expansion as 
Vice Chairman and CEO. Jack was appointed a 
member of the Financial System Vulnerabilities 
Committee and the Group Risk Committee.
At the forthcoming AGM we shall bid farewell to 
our two longest-serving independent directors, 
namely, our Senior Independent Director, Rachel 
Lomax, and Sam Laidlaw. Rachel during her tenure 
has served on the Audit, Risk and Nomination 
Committees, and took responsibility as the first 
Chair of the Conduct & Values Committee to 
establish its terms of reference and its agenda. 
Sam served on, and latterly chaired, both the 
Remuneration and Nomination Committees. 
Together, Rachel and Sam have also been leading 
the process to manage my own succession. Their 
combined knowledge of regulatory and public 
policy, business leadership, corporate governance 
and consumer issues has been invaluable to the 
Board. On behalf of all shareholders, I want to 
thank them for their dedication and commitment.
Chairman succession
In the Circular inviting shareholders to the 2016 
AGM, I indicated that the process to find my own 
successor had been initiated with the intention of 
having this concluded during 2017. This process 
remains on track and an announcement will be 
made in due course.
Outlook
We have recently upgraded our forecasts for global 
economic growth reflecting the likelihood of a shift 
in US fiscal policy and a broader based cyclical 
recovery. As in recent years, incremental growth is 
expected to be driven by emerging economies in 
which HSBC is well represented. Risks to this 
central scenario, however, remain high. In 
particular, we highlight the threat of populism 
impacting policy choices in upcoming European 
elections, possible protectionist measures from the 
new US administration impacting global trade, 
uncertainties facing the UK and the EU as they 
enter Brexit negotiations, and the impact of a 
stronger dollar on emerging economies with  
high debt levels.
Countering these factors are signs of a cyclical 
upturn. Global purchasing manager indices are  
at their strongest for some time, the US economy 
looks robust and growth in China has held up  
well, defying the concerns reflected in the market 
retrenchment seen in the first quarter of 2016. 
Additionally, commodity prices have risen, 
reflecting optimism regarding growth in 
infrastructure investment as well as agreement 
reached to cut oil supply. These factors also imply 
reflation across the major economies and rising 
interest rates, which would benefit HSBC’s 
conservative balance sheet structure.
‘We enter 2017 with the restructuring  
of the Group essentially completed,  
and with a strong capital position  
and a conservative balance sheet’
However, it is fair to reflect that the upgrades to 
economic growth we are now forecasting are 
largely the partial reversal of downgrades made 
last year when uncertainty was elevated as a result 
of the unexpected political events. Forecast global 
growth remains slightly lower than its long-term 
trend with risks largely to the downside.
We enter 2017 with the restructuring of the Group 
essentially completed, and with a strong capital 
position and a conservative balance sheet. We are 
gaining market share in areas of importance to 
HSBC as others scale back and our offerings 
become more competitive. Much of the heavy 
investment in reshaping the Group to improve 
productivity, embrace technological change and 
reinforce global standards of business conduct  
has been made. 
As ever, we owe a huge amount to our 235,000 
colleagues who have delivered this change at the 
same time as working tirelessly to meet customers’ 
expectations of them. On behalf of the Board,  
I want to thank them all for their dedication  
and commitment.

border mergers and acquisitions. HSBC was 
recognised as the ‘World’s Best Investment Bank’ 
and ‘World’s Best Bank for Corporates’ at the 
Euromoney Awards for Excellence 2016.
Commercial Banking performed well, particularly 
in the UK and Hong Kong, growing adjusted 
revenue in spite of a slow-down in global trade. 
Gains in Global Liquidity and Cash Management, 
and Credit and Lending, exceeded the reduction  
in trade finance revenue. Global Trade and 
Receivables Finance continued to capture market 
share in major markets including Hong Kong and 
Singapore, maintaining our position as the world’s 
number one trade finance bank. 
Retail Banking and Wealth Management 
performance was mixed. Overall adjusted revenue 
was down, due largely to the impact of reduced 
client activity in Hong Kong on our Wealth 
Management businesses. At the same time, strong 
mortgage balance growth in the UK, Hong Kong 
and mainland China, and higher current account 
and savings balances in the UK and Hong Kong, 
helped increase revenue in Retail Banking. These 
increased balances should support revenue growth 
in 2017 and beyond. 
We have considered it appropriate to write off  
the remaining goodwill in the European private 
banking business. This goodwill relates principally 
to the original purchase of Safra Republic Holdings 
in 1999. The restructuring of Global Private 
Banking is now largely complete, and although 
Global Private Banking is now much smaller  
than it was three years ago, it is deliberately 
positioned for sustainable growth with a focus  
on serving the personal wealth management 
needs of the leadership and owners of the  
Group’s corporate clients.
Our cost-reduction programmes continue to  
bring down our adjusted operating expenses.  
The traction that these programmes have gained in 
the last 18 months has enabled us to increase the 
amount of costs that we are able to remove from 
the business. We now expect to deliver annualised 
cost savings of around $6bn by the end of 2017, 
and will invest an equivalent total of around $6bn 
over the same time-frame in order to achieve this.

Stuart Gulliver Group Chief Executive
We made good progress in 2016. The 
implementation of our strategic actions is well 
advanced and our global universal business model 
performed well in challenging conditions. Our 
reported profit before tax reflected a number of 
large significant items, including a write-off of all  
the remaining goodwill in Global Private Banking in 
Europe, an accounting loss on the sale of our Brazil 
business, and investments to achieve our cost-
saving target. Our adjusted profits were broadly 
unchanged year on year following solid 
performances by our global businesses. These 
enabled us to capture market share in strategic 
product areas and build a platform for future 
growth. We delivered positive adjusted jaws in 2016.
Performance
Global Banking and Markets recovered from a 
sector-wide slow start to generate higher adjusted 
revenue than for 2015. Our Markets businesses 
performed well in challenging conditions, 
particularly in Fixed Income products. Our 
transaction banking businesses also grew revenue, 
especially Global Liquidity and Cash Management. 
We made market share gains in Fixed Income in 
Europe, and achieved our best ever league table 
rankings in global debt capital markets and cross-
 

--- Page 10 ---
Strategic Report | Group Chief Executive’s Review
These savings should more than compensate for 
additional investment in regulatory programmes 
and compliance. 
We continue to make strong progress in 
implementing our strategic actions to improve 
returns and gain maximum value from our 
international network. We are on course to 
complete the majority of these actions by the  
end of 2017 (see pages 12 to 13), in line with our 
targets. Our targeted reduction of risk-weighted 
assets is 97% complete, and the success of our 
cost saving programmes means that we now 
expect to exceed our cost reduction target. 
The turnaround of our Mexico business  
continues to accelerate. Improved lending and 
deposit balances, interest rate rises and better 
collaboration between businesses helped generate 
significantly higher profits compared with 2015. 
We also made significant market share gains, 
particularly in consumer lending. 
We have continued to enhance our business  
in Asia-Pacific, launching our first exclusively 
HSBC-branded credit card in mainland China, 
growing assets under management and insurance 
new business premiums, and increasing loans  
in the Pearl River Delta. We also extended our 
leadership of the offshore renminbi bond market 
and achieved our best ranking for China outbound 
mergers and acquisitions since 2003.
We are better protected from financial crime 
because of the investment we have made in  
our Global Standards programme. Our Monitor  
has raised certain concerns, but we have 
continued to progress and our commitment 
remains unwavering. By the end of this year, we 
are on track to have our anti-money laundering  
and sanctions policy framework in place and to 
have introduced major compliance IT systems 
across the Group. Beyond 2017, we will continue  
to work to fine tune those systems and to ensure 
that our improvements are fully integrated into  
our day-to-day risk management practices.
Our strong common equity tier 1 ratio of 13.6% 
reinforces our ability to support the dividend,  
invest in the business and manage the continuing 
uncertain regulatory environment.
Delivering value for shareholders
In December, we completed the $2.5bn equity 
buy-back that we commenced at the half-year.  
We are also now in a position to retire more of 
the capital that previously supported the Brazil 
business. Having received the appropriate 
regulatory clearances, we will therefore execute  
a further share buy-back of up to $1bn in the first 
half of 2017. This will bring the total value of shares 
repurchased since last August to $3.5bn.
We will continue to contemplate further share 
buy-backs as circumstances permit, and  
we remain confident of sustaining the annual 
dividend at the current level for the foreseeable 
future through the long-term earnings capacity  
of the business.
A business fit for the future
While our strategic actions are improving our 
network, we are also anticipating and adapting  
to the social, economic and technological trends 
that are changing our operating environment and 
our customers’ needs and expectations.
The adoption of rapidly evolving digital 
technologies by our customers is arguably the 
most transformative force for the financial services 
industry. Through our global network, we are able 
to identify and respond to digital trends across  
70 countries and territories, applying the 
technologies that provide the greatest benefit to 
our customers. We are investing $2.1bn in digital 
transformation in Retail Banking and Wealth 
Management, Commercial Banking, and Global 
Banking and Markets between 2015 and the  
end of 2020, and we have already launched 
innovative ways to make banking faster, easier  
and safer. HSBC is now the biggest financial 
services user of biometrics globally, and we 
continue to roll out voice recognition and 
fingerprint technology across our network. In 2016, 
we enhanced our internet and mobile banking 
platforms in several of our key markets, including 
the UK and Hong Kong, and launched innovation 
labs around the world dedicated to the application 
of artificial intelligence, data management and 
improvements in cybersecurity. These labs, 
together with our fintech partnerships, will help  
us use technology to deliver better banking for  
our customers.

If digital technology is mankind’s greatest 
opportunity, preventing climate change is its 
greatest challenge. The Paris Agreement of 
December 2015 reflected a new consensus on  
the need to strengthen the global response to 
climate change. Major injections of capital are  
now required to finance new technologies, 
infrastructure and the transition of traditional 
industries from high to low carbon, and to cover 
the costs of climate adaptation. As the principal 
intermediaries between entrepreneurs, businesses 
and investors, banks have a responsibility to help 
direct this flow of capital. We are already working 
with our clients and with investors to help them 
allocate capital and direct finance towards lower-
carbon, carbon-resilient activities, and in 2016  
we established a Sustainable Financing Unit to 
coordinate this work across business lines. 
Headquartered in London, but with resources  
in New York and Hong Kong, this new unit will 
support colleagues tasked with creating and 
delivering innovative climate products, and help 
them uncover new sources of sustainable finance. 
‘The changes we have made since 2011 have 
equipped HSBC to improve returns and gain 
maximum value from our international network’
We are also seeking to influence client practices 
and to build the data, the tools and the 
transparency necessary to embed understanding 
of climate risk into the way that markets function. 
In 2016, HSBC Global Research expanded its 
coverage of environment, social and corporate 
governance factors to give our clients the 
information they need to inform their investment 
decisions. This builds on the work of the world-
leading HSBC Climate Change Centre for 
Excellence, which in 2017 celebrates 10 years  
of delivering market-leading information on climate 
policy to clients across the globe. Work is also 
underway to expand the Group’s disclosure of 
non-financial data to meet the needs of 
shareholders and other stakeholders.
We are investing to adapt to the changing face  
of trade. As the world’s largest trade finance bank 
with more than 150 years’ experience at both ends 
of the world’s busiest trade routes, we are perfectly 
placed to help modernise and digitise long-
standing trade finance methods, many of which 
would still be recognisable to HSBC’s founders.  
We are already working with a broad coalition  
of partners around the world to make the promise  
of blockchain technology a reality with regards  
to trade finance. HSBC has already helped develop  
a blockchain prototype for a letter of credit that 
confirms the possibility of sharing information 
between all parties on a private distributed  
ledger. In early 2017, we signed a memorandum  
of understanding with six other banks to make 
domestic and cross-border commerce easier  
for European SMEs using blockchain technology. 
We are also seeking to create ways of financing  
the growing services trade, which we estimate  
will account for a quarter of global trade by 2030.  
At a time when international politics threaten to 
increase rather than decrease the cost of trade,  
we will continue to invest both time and resources 
to find ways of making trade finance cheaper, 
faster, simpler and more secure for our customers. 
Looking forward
We anticipate new challenges in 2017 from 
geopolitical developments, heightened trade 
barriers and regulatory uncertainty. However, the 
changes we have made since 2011 have equipped 
HSBC to manage the complexity of today’s global 
business environment. HSBC is a strong and 
resilient business with a global universal business 
model geared to find growth opportunities in a 
low-growth world. If globalisation continues to 
retreat, as seems likely, we are in a strong position 
to capitalise on the regional opportunities that this 
will present, particularly in Asia and Europe. Most 
importantly, the strength of our network gives us 
an unrivalled ability to help our clients navigate  
that same complexity and overcome their own 
challenges, whether exploring new markets or 
making the transition to a low-carbon economy.

Our strategy
We have developed a long-term strategy  
that reflects our purpose and enables us to  
capture value from our international network. 
Develop our  
international network 
To facilitate international trade and capital flows and 
serve our clients, with potential to help them grow 
from small enterprises into large multinationals.
Invest in wealth and  
retail businesses with local scale
To make the most of global social mobility, wealth 
creation and long-term demographic changes  
in our priority markets. 
Value of the network and our strategy
Access to global  
growth opportunities
Our unparalleled network  
covers countries accounting for 
more than 90% of global GDP,  
trade and capital flows. We have  
a leading presence in large and 
fast-growing economies.
Our priority markets cover both 
sides of 11 of the world’s 15 largest 
trade corridors for goods and 
services forecast for 2030, and 
represent at least one side of the 
other four corridors. Six of the 15 
corridors are within Asia and five 
connect countries between two 
geographical regions.
Lower risk profile and volatility  
from our diversified, universal 
banking model
Our 10-year profit before tax 
volatility of 0.9x compares 
favourably with our peers.
Transaction banking product 
revenue of $14.7bn on an adjusted 
basis leads the industry. More than 
45% of our client revenue comes 
from businesses and individuals 
with an international presence.
Business synergies of $10.5bn, 
equivalent to 22% of reported 
revenue reflect products and 
services provided across our  
global businesses.
Strong capital and funding base
CET1 ratio of 13.6%, supported by 
increased shareholders’ equity to 
meet new regulatory requirements 
since the end of 2010.
Four interconnected, global 
businesses share balance sheets 
and liquidity in addition to strong 
commercial links.
Stable shareholder returns
Industry leading dividend – 
approximately $55bn declared from 
2011 to 2016, as well as circa 
$2.5bn of share repurchases.

Strategic actions
We are well on our way towards achieving the  
actions outlined in our June 2015 Investor Update.
Capturing value from our international network
In June 2015, we outlined a series  
of strategic actions to make the most 
of our competitive advantages and 
respond to a changing environment.
These actions are focused on 
improving efficiency in how we use 
our resources, and on investing for 
growth in line with our strategy. Each 
action has targets defined to the end 
of 2017. The table opposite contains a 
summary of our progress in 2016 with 
additional details provided below.
Resizing and simplifying  
our business
We have made significant progress in 
resizing and simplifying our business. 
In 2016, management actions reduced 
RWAs in GB&M and legacy credit by 
$46bn and we completed asset sales 
totalling $10.1bn from our US 
consumer and mortgage lending 
(‘CML’) run-off portfolio.
As part of our initiative to optimise  
our network, we completed the sale 
of HSBC Bank Brazil on 1 July 2016. 
We will continue to serve the 
international and cross-border  
needs of our large corporate clients  
in Brazil through HSBC Brasil S.A. – 
Banco de Investimento.
In the NAFTA region, we grew 
adjusted revenue in Mexico by 18% 
compared with 2015, supported by 
market share gains in RBWM across 
key lending products and a doubling 
of personal loans issued. In the US, 
we grew adjusted revenue in GB&M 
and RBWM compared with 2015  
and continued to support our clients 
internationally. Revenues from 
international subsidiaries of our  
US clients increased by 11% 
compared with 2015.
We have made good progress in our 
cost-saving programme and are on 
track to exceed our exit rate target  
set for the end of 2017. We expect  
to achieve total cost savings of $6.0bn 
through one-off investments (‘costs  
to achieve’) of $6.0bn. The additional 
savings will fund increased costs  
related to regulatory programmes  
and compliance. In 2016, operating 
expenses fell by 4% on an adjusted 
basis compared with 2015, facilitated  
by increased efficiency in our processes. 
For example, we launched a new 
customer-facing digital portal to 
standardise and accelerate the 
onboarding process in 26 markets 
covering more than 70% of CMB 
corporate clients, and we decreased the 
number of manual payments by 80%.
Redeploying capital to grow  
our business
At the heart of our business is our 
international network. We are focusing 
efforts to grow our businesses by 
looking at customers’ needs across 
products, geographies and supply 
chains. In 2016, revenue from 
transaction banking products was up 
2% despite difficult macroeconomic 
conditions. We grew revenues in our 
Global Liquidity and Cash Management 
(GLCM) business. In 2016, we were 
named ‘Best Bank for Corporates’ by 
Euromoney and ‘Best Supply-Chain 
Finance Bank Global’ by the Trade  
Finance Awards.
We continue to invest for growth in 
Asia. In December, we launched our 
own HSBC-branded credit cards in 
mainland China with a full range of 
digital features. We increased the 
number of new RBWM clients in China’s 
Pearl River Delta by 51% compared  
with 2015, and grew our mortgage  
loan books by more than 51%. We grew 
revenues from international subsidiaries 
of our ASEAN-region commercial 
banking clients, and in Singapore  
our innovation lab is developing 
cloud-based treasury services for 
businesses and exploring blockchain 
technology to support documentary 
trade transactions. 
We remain recognised as the leading 
bank for international renminbi (‘RMB’) 
products and services. We were the first 
bank to facilitate overseas institutional 
investment into the China interbank bond 
market since access was expanded in 
early 2016. We were also the first to be 
appointed custodian bank in the two 
newly active RMB qualified foreign 
institutional investor (‘RQFII’) markets  
of the US and Thailand this year.
Finally, we continue to strengthen  
our efforts to protect customers  
and the wider financial system from 
financial crime. In 2016, this included 
further upgrades to our systems, as  
well as additional training for our 
employees. Further detail can be found 
under the Financial Crime Risk section 
of www.hsbc.com/financial-crime-risk.

Strategic Report
Financial overview
Reported results
This table shows our reported results for 
the last three years, ended 31 December 
2016, 2015 and 2014.
Reported profit before tax 
Reported profit before tax of $7.1bn  
was $11.8bn or 62% lower than in  
2015. This was primarily due to net 
adverse movements relating to 
significant items and the unfavourable 
effects of foreign currency translation, 
which are described in more detail on 
page 30. Excluding significant items  
and currency translation, profit before 
tax fell by $0.2bn. 
Reported revenue
Reported revenue of $48.0bn was 
$11.8bn or 20% lower than in 2015,  
in part due to a net unfavourable 
movement in significant items of  
$7.6bn, which included:
 – adverse fair value movements of  
$1.8bn arising from changes in credit 
spreads on our own debt designated  
at fair value, compared with favourable 
movements of $1.0bn in 2015; 
 – a $3.6bn reduction in revenue resulting 
from our sale of operations in Brazil to 
Banco Bradesco S.A., which includes  
a $1.7bn accounting loss recognised  
on the sale; and
 – the non-recurrence of a $1.4bn gain on 
the sale of part of our shareholding in 
Industrial Bank Co. Limited (‘Industrial 
Bank’) in 2015; partly offset by
 – a $0.6bn gain on the disposal of our 
membership interest in Visa Europe  
in the second quarter of 2016 and  
a $0.1bn gain on disposal of our 
membership interest in Visa US  
in the fourth quarter of 2016.
In addition, foreign currency translation 
differences between the periods had  
an adverse effect of $3.0bn. 
These factors contributed to a fall  
in reported revenue in all our global

Excluding significant items and the 
adverse effects of foreign currency 
translation differences between the 
periods, revenue fell by $1.3bn or 2%.
 – costs to achieve of $3.1bn compared 
with $0.9bn in 2015; partly offset by
 – a reduction of $1.0bn in settlements 
and provisions in connection with  
legal matters.
Reported LICs
Reported LICs of $3.4bn were  
$0.3bn lower than in 2015 as reductions 
in RBWM and CMB more than offset  
an increase in GB&M. The reduction 
included favourable effects of foreign 
currency translation differences 
between the periods of $0.2bn, and  
the impact of LICs incurred in the 
disposed Brazil operations of $0.7bn 
compared with $0.9bn in 2015.
Reported operating expenses
Reported operating expenses of 
$39.8bn were $40m or 0.1% higher  
than in 2015. This includes favourable 
effects of currency translation 
differences of $2.1bn between  
the periods, and an increase in 
significant items of $3.3bn, including:
 – a $3.2bn write-off of goodwill in  
our GPB business in Europe; and
In addition, the reported results include 
the operating expenses incurred in our 
Brazil business of $1.1bn compared with 
$2.5bn in 2015.
Excluding significant items and the 
adverse effects of foreign currency 
translation differences between the 
periods, operating expenses fell by 
$1.2bn. Reductions in all our global 
businesses reflected the effects of  
our cost-saving initiatives.
Reported income  
from associates
Reported income from associates  
and joint ventures of $2.4bn  
decreased by $0.2bn.
On 21 February 2017, the Board 
announced a fourth interim dividend  
of $0.21 per ordinary share.
