significantly lower than we had anticipated entering the year, and  
the PC market segment was impacted by the growth of tablets.

Intel has an ambitious vision: Create and extend computing 
Data storage and high-performance computing
Demand for transistors in servers, storage, and networking continues 
to grow. Between 2009 and 2012, the total available market for cloud 
computing processors tripled, and by 2015 we expect that more than 
3 billion connected users and 15 billion connected devices will be  
driving more than 1,500 exabytes of cloud traffic per year. Working 
with our McAfee subsidiary, we are helping to build confidence in 
private and public clouds through security solutions for the data center,
