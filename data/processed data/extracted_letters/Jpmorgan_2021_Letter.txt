Dear Fellow Shareholders,
Jamie Dimon,  
Chairman and  
Chief Executive 
Officer
We are facing challenges at every turn: a pandemic, unprecedented government 
actions, a strong recovery after a sharp and deep global recession, a highly 
polarized U.S. election, mounting inflation, a war in Ukraine and dramatic  
economic sanctions against Russia. While all this turmoil has serious ramifica-
tions on our company, its effect on the world — with the extreme suffering of  
the Ukrainian people and the potential restructuring of the global order — is far 
more important. 
Adding to the disruption, these events are unfolding while America remains 
divided within its borders, with many arguing that it has lost its essential leader-
ship role outside of its borders and around the world. But during this difficult 
time, we have a moment to put aside our differences, offer solutions and work 
with others in the Western world to come together in defense of democracy and 
2

essential freedoms, including free enterprise. We have seen America, in partner-
ship with other countries around the globe, come together previously during 
instances of conflict and crisis. This juncture is also a moment when our country 
needs to work across the private and public sectors to lead once again by, 
among other remediations, improving American competitiveness and better ful-
filling equal access to opportunity for all. JPMorgan Chase, a company that has 
historically worked across borders and boundaries, will do its part to ensure the 
global economy is safe and secure. I discuss these themes later in this letter.
Although I begin this annual letter to shareholders in a challenging landscape,  
I remain proud of what our company and our hundreds of thousands of employ-
ees around the world have achieved, collectively and individually. As you know, 
we have long championed the essential role of banking in a community — its 
potential for bringing people together, for enabling companies and individuals to 
reach for their dreams, and for being a source of strength in difficult times. 
Throughout these past two challenging years, we never stopped doing all the 
things we should be doing to serve our clients and our communities. 
Looking back on the last year and the past two decades — starting from my time 
as CEO of Bank One in 2000 — it is clear that our financial discipline, constant 
investment in innovation and ongoing development of our people are what  
enabled us to persevere in our steadfast dedication to help clients, communities 
and countries throughout the world. 2021 was another strong year for JPMorgan 
Chase, with the firm generating record revenue, as well as setting numerous 
other records in each of our lines of business. We earned $48.3 billion in net 
income on revenue of $125.3 billion versus $29.1 billion on revenue of $122.9  
billion in 2020, reflecting strong underlying performance across our businesses. 
Included in the $48.3 billion is $9.2 billion after tax in reserve releases due to 
the volatility introduced by the new current expected credit loss accounting 
3

standard. We have pointed out repeatedly that we do not consider these reserve 
releases core or recurring profits because they are driven by hypothetical,  
probability-weighted scenarios. Excluding these reserve releases, we still earned 
18% on tangible equity — an extremely healthy number. We generally grew mar-
ket share across our businesses and continued to make significant investments  
in products, people and technology, all while maintaining credit discipline and  
a fortress balance sheet. In total, we extended credit and raised capital of  
$3.2 trillion for large and small businesses, governments and U.S. consumers.
I’d like to note some steadfast principles that are worth repeating. The first is 
that while JPMorgan Chase stock is owned by large institutions, pension plans, 
mutual funds and directly by individual investors, in almost all cases, the 
ultimate beneficiaries are individuals in our communities. More than 100  
million people in the United States own stock, and a large percentage of these 
individuals, in one way or another, own JPMorgan Chase stock. Many of these 
people are veterans, teachers, police officers, firefighters, healthcare workers, 
retirees or those saving for a home, education or retirement. Your management 
team goes to work every day recognizing the enormous responsibility that we 
have to our shareholders. 
Second, while we don’t run the company worrying about the stock price in the 
short run, in the long run our stock price is a measure of the progress we have 
made over the years. This progress is a function of continual investments in  
our people, systems and products, in good and bad times, to build our capabili-
ties. Whether looking back 10 years or since the JPMorgan Chase/Bank One 
merger in 2004, these investments have resulted in our stock’s significant out-
performance of the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and the Standard & Poor’s 
Financials Index. These important investments will also drive our company’s 
future prospects and position it to grow and prosper for decades.

1  On March 27, 2000, Jamie Dimon was hired as CEO of Bank One.
We have consistently described to you, our shareholders, the basic principles 
and strategies we use to build this company — from maintaining a fortress bal-
ance sheet, constantly investing and nurturing talent to fully satisfying regula-
tors, continually improving risk, governance and controls, and serving customers 
and clients while lifting up communities worldwide. 
If you look deeper, you will find that our success and accomplishments are founded 
on our commitment to our shareholders. Shareholder value can be built only if you 
maintain a healthy and vibrant company, which means doing a good job taking care 
of your customers, employees and communities. Conversely, how can you have a 
healthy company if you neglect any of these stakeholders? As we have learned in 
2021, there are myriad ways an institution can demonstrate its compassion for its 
employees and its communities while still upholding shareholder value.
Adhering to our basic principles and strategies allows us to drive good organic 
growth and properly manage our capital (including dividends and stock buy-
backs), as we have consistently demonstrated over the past decades. All of this 
is shown in the charts on pages 8-12, which illustrate how we have grown our 
6
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

--- Page 9 ---
franchises, how we compare with our competitors and how we look at our  
fortress balance sheet. I invite you to peruse them at your leisure. In addition,  
I urge you to read the CEO letters in this Annual Report, which will give you 
more specific details about our businesses and our plans for the future. 
There are two other critical points I would like to make. We strive to build endur-
ing businesses, and we are not a conglomerate — all our businesses rely on and 
benefit from each other. Both of these factors help generate our superior 
returns. But, despite our best efforts, the moats that protect this company are 
not particularly deep — and we face extraordinary competition. I have written 
about this reality extensively in the past and cover it in more detail in this letter. 
However, it is the hand we have been dealt, and we will play it as best we can.
My friend, Warren Buffett, spoke in his letter this year about his silent partner — 
the U.S. government — noting that all his company’s success is predicated upon 
the extraordinary conditions our country creates. He is right to say to his share-
holders that when they see the flag, they should all say thank you. We should, 
too. I do just want to note that in our case, the silent partner is not so silent. 
JPMorgan Chase is a healthy and thriving company, and we always want to give 
back and pay our fair share. We do — and we want it to be spent well and have 
the greatest impact. To give you an idea of where our taxes and fees go: In the 
last 10 years, we paid $42 billion in federal, state and local taxes in the United 
States and $17 billion in taxes outside of the United States. We also paid the  
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation $11 billion so that it has the resources  
to cover the failure of any major American bank.
Finally, the basis of our success is our people. They are the ones who serve our 
customers and communities, build the technology, make the strategic decisions, 
manage the risks, determine our investments and drive innovation. Whatever 
your view is of the world’s complexity and the risks and opportunities ahead, 
having a great team of people — with guts, brains, integrity and enormous capa-
bilities to navigate personally challenging circumstances while maintaining high 
standards of professional excellence — is what ensures our prosperity, now and 
in the future.

These assets are cash (essentially deposits at  
the Fed) and other highly marketable securities. 
This is an extraordinary amount of liquidity —
approximately $700 billion is required by the 
liquidity coverage ratio and will always consist  
of the most conservative assets.
This is an extraordinary 
amount of consumer  
and wholesale deposits.
A large portion of our $125 billion  
of revenue is fairly recurring and  
predictable; for example, revenue 
from loans, Asset Management,  
Consumer Banking, Wealth  
Management, Securities Services  
and Payments. We’ve already told 
our shareholders that net interest 
income (excluding CIB Markets) will 
be more than $8 billion higher in 
2022, primarily due to higher rates.
We tend to look at this number  
on a more normalized basis. For 
example, charge-offs are artificially 
low in this part of the cycle (a more 
normal amount would be $7 billion 
versus $3 billion), and we don’t  
consider the reserve release of  
$12 billion as core or recurring profits. 
If you adjust for this and add back  
the $8 billion of normalized higher 
net interest income1, our normalized  
pre-tax profit would be closer to  
$50+ billion.
These are still our riskiest assets,  
but you can see how small they are 
relative to the size of our balance 
sheet.
The best way to ascertain actual  
risk is by looking at Advanced risk-
weighted assets (RWA), which  
total only $1.1 trillion (excluding 
operational risk RWA) because so 
many assets have so little risk.
There is more than $500 billion in 
preferred stock, long-term debt and 
common equity, an extraordinary 
capital base. Equally important, the 
amount of unsecured short-term 
financing, the riskiest type, is 
negligible.
Our fortress balance sheet is accompanied by a fortress  
income statement. Even under extreme stress, our company 
could make a profit. For example, if credit losses were  
$10 billion higher or more, if we had a $10 billion operational 
error or if certain asset-based revenue dropped by as much  
as $10 billion, we would still be in very good shape.
And in terms of capital preservation, we could, if we had  
to, cut the dividend to zero, saving $12 billion in a year.  
Or we could reduce expenses substantially — which we could 
easily achieve.
