Letter From Your CEO
Intel is evolving from a PC company to one that powers the infrastructure for an increasingly smart and 
connected world. While 2015 started with challenges in PC market demand as well as macroeconomic 
and currency conditions, we finished the year strong. Our financials demonstrate a strategy that’s working 
and provide a solid foundation for growth.
Intel reported full-year revenue of $55.4 billion, which was nearly flat versus 2014. Record revenue in  
the data center, Internet of Things, and memory businesses mostly offset the decline in PC demand. 
These businesses made up 40% of our revenue and delivered $2.2 billion in profitable revenue growth. 
This was the first year that these growth areas made up the majority of our operating profit. We also 
sharpened the focus of our Intel Security Group and exceeded our previously stated goal of improving 
mobile profitability by $800 million.
Intel’s business model is evolving
While the client computing business will continue to be a valuable source of cash flow and intellectual property (IP), our 
business model is evolving. The data center and Internet of Things businesses are the primary growth engines for Intel,  
and memory and field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) can accelerate these opportunities—forming and fueling a  
virtuous cycle of growth. 
The ability to integrate and reuse IP across a broad portfolio of products also differentiates our strategy and allows us to 
evolve in new ways. We reuse IP from our client computing business, for example. We also plan to reuse the IP we gained  
with our acquisition of Altera to deliver a new class of integrated microprocessor and FPGA products for our data center  
and Internet of Things customers. 
Expanding the boundaries of technology
Intel’s relentless pursuit of Moore’s Law is foundational to our strategy and another valuable differentiator. Our manufacturing 
leadership allows us to continuously push the limits of performance and functionality. As a result, we expand the boundaries  
of technology to make the most amazing experiences possible. I’m proud that in addition to delivering solid financials that 
demonstrate our evolution, we delivered innovation. We launched our best processor ever—the 14-nanometer 6th generation 
Intel® Core™ processor—and a new, low-power Intel® Curie™ processor for wearables and other Internet of Things devices. We  
also announced 3D XPoint™ technology, a revolutionary new class of memory, and kicked off an ambitious cloud computing 
initiative that is accelerating public, private, and hybrid cloud adoption. 
Setting challenging goals to evolve how we do business
At Intel, we also tackle significant societal challenges, setting transparent and ambitious goals to address corporate 
responsibility issues. In 2015, we launched our Diversity and Inclusion initiative, setting a bold hiring and retention goal  
to achieve full1 representation of women and underrepresented minorities in Intel’s U.S. workforce by 2020. I’m also  
incredibly proud that a thorough compensation analysis showed we’re at 100% gender pay parity for U.S. employees  
across job types and levels.2 In addition, we continued our efforts to establish a conflict-free3 supply chain for Intel products. 
Maintaining accountability in the supply chain will be an ongoing process for Intel.
A strong foundation for growth
In 2015, we delivered results that showed our strategy is working. As we move forward, we will continue to focus on flawless 
execution and making amazing experiences possible. We’ll also broaden our data center and Internet of Things product 
portfolios with the Altera acquisition. In summary, we’ll continue pivoting to power the infrastructure for the smart and 
connected world as we diversify beyond our PC business. We’ve built a strong foundation for long-term growth for the 
company, but there’s more work to do to continue Intel’s evolution.

1  Full representation (or full workforce representation) is the point at which Intel’s workforce in the U.S. matches the supply of skilled talent available (market availability) for current 
roles at Intel.
2 Parity is the quality or state of being equal or equivalent. Data does not include subsidiaries.
3  “Conflict free” as used here refers to supply chains whose sources of conflict minerals (tantalum, tin, tungsten and/or gold) do not, based on our due diligence, finance or benefit

Letter From Your Chairman
Financial Results
Intel is a technology company. We invent things. Our 
obligation to you, the owners, is to take those inventions 
and create business value to earn a return on our efforts.
Many of the Board’s strategic conversations in 2015 
focused on how best to allocate resources for stockholder 
value. The company is investing more in growing and 
emerging businesses in the data center, Internet of Things, 
and memory. And it is spending less in mature, less 
profitable, or less strategic businesses.
In the data center, we have strengthened the core CPU franchise and also 
expanded it with investments in new capabilities, such as fabrics, silicon  
photonics, and customization. The data center is Intel’s most significant  
opportunity for potential growth.
The Internet of Things segment is achieving high growth rates as it builds on its 
traditional embedded processor business and finds new opportunities in the 
cloud with solutions and technologies from across the company. This also adds 
value to other businesses at Intel. 
The memory segment continues to innovate and achieve high and profitable 
growth with NAND technology and solid-state drive (SSD) solutions. The 
introduction of 3D NAND and 3D XPoint technologies has the potential to help 
us deliver better solutions to customers in the data center and other businesses 
in the company.
The PC business continues to be a vital source of technology, production volume, 
and profits. We are maximizing the return in a difficult environment. Continuing 
product innovation and segmentation have helped protect pricing even as unit 
volume declines. Many of the strategic investments that have made this possible 
are also key to building other businesses at Intel. 
The foundation for all of this is silicon technology. Moore’s Law has defined our 
past and will shape our business and company for years to come.
The Board made a large allocation of capital in 2015 to fund the acquisition of 
Altera, which closed in 2016. We expect Altera to augment efforts in the data 
center and Internet of Things. We have also increased capital commitments to 
new memory technologies that are enabling important opportunities for the 
non-volatile SSD and data center businesses. And we continue to invest in 
leading-edge manufacturing capabilities. 
As part of its regular review of cash policy, the Board approved an eight-cent 
increase in the cash dividend to $1.04 on an annual basis, beginning in the first 
quarter of 2016. Intel repurchased $3.0 billion worth of Intel stock in 2015. The 
total cash returned to stockholders through dividends and repurchases in 2015 
was $7.6 billion.
One of the highlights of the last year for me personally was the public dialogue 
around the 50th anniversary of Moore’s Law. It was encouraging to see the 
interest it generated, with thousands of stories reaching millions of people in  
39 countries.  
People often think that Moore’s Law is all about technology. In fact, Gordon’s 
original paper was about economics. As with each of our founders, Gordon made 
the successful transition from scientist to businessman. He understood the 
obligation to owners and the need to connect innovation to business.  
That tradition is very much alive today at Intel. The mandates to innovate and to 
create business value remain important aspects of Intel culture. So does the 
emphasis on execution and results.
This is a time of significant change. There is more work to do, and we expect to 
report continuing progress.
