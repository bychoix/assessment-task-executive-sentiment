Dear Fellow Shareholders,
Jamie Dimon,  
Chairman and  
Chief Executive Officer
Once again, I begin this letter with a sense of pride about JPMorgan Chase. As I 
look back on last year — in fact, the last decade — it is remarkable how well our 
company has performed. And I’m not only talking about our strong financial 
performance — but also about how much we have accomplished to help our clients, 
customers and communities all around the world. Ours is an exceptional company 
with an extraordinary heritage and a promising future. 
We continue to make excellent progress around technology, risk and controls, 
innovation, diversity and reduced bureaucracy. We’ve helped communities large 
and small — by doing what we do best (lending, investing and serving our clients); 
by creatively expanding certain flagship Corporate Responsibility programs, 
including the Entrepreneurs of Color Fund, The Fellowship Initiative and our Service 
Corps; and by applying our successful Detroit investment model to neighborhood 
revitalization efforts in the Bronx in New York City, Chicago and Washington, D.C. 
Throughout a period of profound political and economic change around the world, 
our company has been steadfast in our dedication to the clients, communities and 
countries we serve while earning a fair return for our shareholders.

2017 was another record year across many measures for our company as we added 
clients and customers and delivered record earnings per share. We earned $24.4 
billion in net income on revenue1 of $103.6 billion (if we exclude the tax charge 
at year-end, 2017 net income would have been a record $26.9 billion), reflecting 
strong underlying performance across our businesses. We now have delivered 
record results in seven of the last eight years, and we have confidence that we will 
continue to deliver in the future.

As you know, we believe tangible book value per share is a good measure of the 
value we have created for our shareholders. If our asset and liability values are 
appropriate — and we believe they are — and if we can continue to deploy this 
capital profitably, we now think that it can earn approximately 17% return on 
tangible equity for the foreseeable future. Then, in our view, our company should 
ultimately be worth considerably more than tangible book value. The chart on the 
bottom of page 3 shows that tangible book value “anchors” the stock price.

Tangible book value over time captures the company’s use of capital, balance sheet and profitability. In this chart, we are looking at 
heritage Bank One shareholders and JPMorgan Chase & Co. shareholders. The chart shows the increase in tangible book value per share;  
it is an after-tax number assuming all dividends were retained vs. the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (S&P 500), which is a pre-tax number 
with dividends reinvested.
1 On March 27, 2000, Jamie Dimon was hired as CEO of Bank One.
In the last five years, we have bought back nearly $40 billion in stock. In prior 
years, I explained why buying back our stock at tangible book value per share was 
a no-brainer. Six years ago, we offered an example of this, with earnings per share 
and tangible book value per share being substantially higher than they otherwise 
would have been just four years later. While we prefer buying back our stock at 
tangible book value, we think it makes sense to do so even at or above two times 
tangible book value for reasons similar to those we’ve expressed in the past. If we 
buy back a big block of stock this year, we would expect (using analyst earnings 
estimates for the next five years) earnings per share in five years to be 2% —3% 
higher and tangible book value to be virtually unchanged.

We want to remind our shareholders that we much prefer to use our capital to grow 
than to buy back stock. Buying back stock should only be considered when we either 
cannot invest (sometimes that’s a function of regulatory policies) or when we are 
generating excess, unusable capital. We currently have excess capital, but due to 
recent tax reform and a more constructive regulatory environment, we hope, in the 
future, to use more of our excess capital to grow our businesses, expand into new 
markets and support our employees.

1 On March 27, 2000, Jamie Dimon was hired as CEO of Bank One.
Our stock price is a measure of the progress we have made over the years. This 
progress is a function of continually making important investments, in good 
times and not-so-good times, to build our capabilities — people, systems and 
products. These investments drive the future prospects of our company and 
position it to grow and prosper for decades. Whether looking back over five 
years, 10 years or since the Bank One/JPMorgan Chase merger (approximately 13 
years ago), our stock has significantly outperformed the Standard & Poor’s 500 
Index (S&P 500) and the S&P Financials Index. And this growth came during a 
time of unprecedented challenges for banks — both the Great Recession and the 
5

--- Page 8 ---
extraordinarily difficult legal, regulatory and political environment that followed. 
We have long contended that these factors explained why bank stock price/
earnings ratios were appropriately depressed. And we believe the anticipated 
reversal of many negatives and an increasingly more favorable business 
environment, coupled with our sustained, strong business results, are among the 
reasons our stock price has done so well this past year. 
We do not worry about the stock price in the short run, and we do not worry about 
quarterly earnings. Our mindset is that we consistently build the company — if  
you do the right things, the stock price will take care of itself. In the next section,  
I discuss in more detail how we think about building shareholder value for the long 
run while also taking care of customers, employees and communities.
JPMorgan Chase stock is owned by large institutions, pension plans, mutual funds 
and directly by individual investors. However, it is important to remember that 
in almost all cases, the ultimate owner is an individual. Well over 100 million 
people in the United States own stocks, and a large percentage of them, in one 
way or another, own JPMorgan Chase stock. Many of these people are veterans, 
teachers, police officers, firefighters, retirees, or those saving for a home, school 
or retirement. Your management team goes to work every day recognizing the 
enormous responsibility that we have to perform for our shareholders. 
In this letter, I discuss the issues highlighted below — which describe many of our 
successes and opportunities, as well as our challenges and responses.

Since our business leaders describe their businesses later in this report, I am not going to be 
repetitive within this section. I encourage you to read their letters following this Letter to 
Shareholders. Instead, in this section, I deal with some critical themes around how we run 
this company – in good times and in bad times – and how we are continuing to build for 
what we think will be a bright future. 
1.  How has the company grown? 
Below is a powerful representation of how 
we have grown and built client franchises 
over time.

share increases were due to our acquisitions 
of Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual. But 
in all cases, this growth is driven by consis-
tent and disciplined investment in our busi-
nesses. The chart below shows how we try 
to measure customer satisfaction in multiple 
ways. For the most part, we have seen a rise 
in these scores as well. It is a given that you 
will not grow your share – unless you are 
satisfying your customers – and we know 
they can always walk across the street to be 
served by another bank.

2.  How will the company continue to grow? What are the organic growth opportunities?
We have good market share in most busi-
nesses, but we see organic growth opportu-
nities almost everywhere – some large and 
some small. Following are a few examples: 
Consumer & Community Banking
•  We recently announced that we will start 
to expand the consumer branch business 
into cities like Boston, Philadelphia and 
Washington, D.C. Over the next five years, 
we hope to expand to another 15-20 new 
markets. We know the competition is 
tough, but we have much to offer. When 
JPMorgan Chase comes to town, we come 
not just with our consumer branches but 
also with mortgages, investments, credit 
cards, private banking, small and midsized 
business banking, government business 
and corporate responsibility initiatives to 
support our communities.
•  In addition, this year we are rolling out 
many new exciting products and have 
made several improvements around the 
customer’s experience, including a fully 
mobile bank pilot (Finn), digital account 
openings, facial recognition in our app, 
the Amazon Prime Rewards Visa card and 
a simpler online application for Business 
Banking customers. 
•  We also are adding many tools that will 
help our customers manage their financial 
affairs. For example, in the credit card busi-
ness, we will be allowing our customers 
to review and decide how and where they 
want their cards and credit lines to be used. 
In Consumer Banking, we are adding finan-
cial planning tools and insights that help 
customers make the most of their money – 
and there’s more coming. 
10
Corporate & Investment Bank
•  We see growth opportunities even in 
Fixed Income, Currencies and Commodi-
ties, where we already have the #1 market 
share at 11.4%. There may be some under-
lying growth as the capital markets of the 
world grow, even though this is partially 
offset by declining margins like we 
have experienced over the last 30 years. 
However, we see opportunities to gain 
share in various products and in certain 
regions where we have low share. 
•  This opportunity would be true for Invest-
ment Banking, too. Country by country 
and industry by industry, there are still 
plenty of opportunities to increase our low 
market share. For example, we have 10% 
share in the United States but less than 
5% share in Asia. 
•  In Treasury Services and Custody, where 
our market shares are 4.7% and 8.0%, 
respectively, we believe we can grow 
significantly by adding bankers, building 
better technology, entering new countries, 
building better products and continuing to 
do a great job for clients. In this business, 
while you make large initial investments 
in order to grow, when you gain clients, 
they usually stick with you for a long time. 
•  Over time, we do expect to expand our 
Corporate & Investment Bank into new 
countries, which will benefit all the busi-
nesses within this franchise.
Commercial Banking
•  This past year, Commercial Banking has 
completed its expansion into the top 50 
markets in the United States – this will 
drive growth for decades. And remember, 
when Commercial Banking opens its 
doors, it also helps drive the growth of  
our Private Bank and the Corporate & 
Investment Bank businesses. 
•  Commercial Banking has added many 
specialized industry bankers to better 
serve those specific segments.

Asset & Wealth Management
•  Across the company – not just in tech-
nology – we have thousands of employees 
who are data scientists or have advanced 
degrees in science, technology, engi-
neering and math. Of the nearly 50,000 
people in technology at the company, 
more than 31,000 are in development and 
engineering jobs, and more than 2,500 
are in digital technology. Think of these 
talented individuals as driving change 
across the company. 
•  Artificial intelligence, big data and machine 
learning are helping us reduce risk and 
fraud, upgrade service, improve under-
writing and enhance marketing across the 
firm. And this is just the beginning.
•  Our shared technology infrastructure 
– our networks, data centers, and the 
public and private cloud – decreases costs, 
enhances efficiency and makes all our 
businesses more productive. In addition, 
this allows us to embrace the fact that 
every business and merchant has its own 
software and also wants easy, integrated 
access to our products and services. We 
are delivering on that through the creation 
of a common JPMorgan Chase API (appli-
cation programming interface) store that 
allows customers to add simple, secure 
payments to their software. And we are 
building everything digital – both for indi-
vidual customers and large corporations – 
from onboarding to idea generation.
•  Increasingly, the management teams  
of Consumer & Community Banking,  
Corporate & Investment Bank,  
Commercial Banking and Asset & Wealth  
Management share ideas, share platforms 
and serve each other’s customers. The 
success of any one business almost always 
helps the other three.
•  In the United States, our share of the 
ultra-high-net-worth market ($10 million 
or greater) is 8%. We believe we have a 
superior business and that we can grow 
our share by essentially adding bankers, 
branches and better products.
•  In the high-net-worth business ($3 million 
to $10 million) and the Chase affluent 
business ($500,000 to $5 million), our 
market shares are only 1% and 4%, respec-
tively. We have no doubt that we can grow 
by adding bankers and locations, particu-
larly because we have some exciting new 
products coming soon. There is no reason 
we can’t more than double our share over 
the next 10 years.
•  We are also adding new products, like 
index funds and exchange-traded funds 
(ETF), that we believe will help drive 
growth.
Across the company
In addition, we are undertaking many 
initiatives across the company that will help 
grow our businesses and better serve our 
customers. 
•  On the payments front, we have devel-
oped multiple products to make wholesale 
payments better, easier and faster. We 
are rolling out these products across our 
platforms, and they should help us solidify 
and grow our position. 
•  On the consumer side, we have intro-
duced Chase Pay, the digital equivalent  
to using a debit or credit card, which 
allows customers to pay online or in-store 
with their mobile phone. We also intro-
duced Zelle, a real-time consumer-to- 
consumer payments system, which 
allows customers to easily, safely and 
immediately send money to their friends 
and family. We expect these products  
to drive lots of customer interactions  
and make our payments offerings 
compelling, even as some very smart 
fintech competitors emerge.
