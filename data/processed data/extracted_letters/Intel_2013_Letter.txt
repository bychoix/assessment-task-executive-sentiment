Letter From Your CEO
I am very excited to be Intel’s sixth CEO. In my first letter to you, I would like to share how we are building on 
Intel’s strengths to accelerate innovation and drive growth. But first, let’s look at the results for fiscal year 2013.  
Intel delivered revenue of $52.7 billion, net income of $9.6 billion, and earnings per share of $1.89. Client 
computing products generated $33 billion in revenue and approximately $12 billion in operating profits. Our 
datacenter business revenue grew to more than $11 billion, driven by rising demand for cloud services, high-
performance computing, storage, and networking. We generated almost $21 billion in cash from operations  
and returned $6.6 billion to our stockholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. 
These are solid results in a time of rapid industry transformation, but we must do better. We are refocusing our efforts to reignite 
growth by driving Intel innovation to market faster. 
Leading in the pursuit of Moore’s Law
The relentless pursuit of Moore’s Law is Intel’s foundation and continues to be our driving force. We lead the industry as the only 
semiconductor manufacturer in the world offering Tri-gate transistors and 22-nanometer (nm) technology-based products. The benefits 
of Moore’s Law can be seen across our product lines in the form of higher performance, lower energy requirements, and lower cost per 
transistor. In 2013, we introduced our 4th generation Intel® Core™ processors, which deliver the largest generation-over-generation 
gain in battery life in Intel’s history, and a new family of low-power Intel® Atom™ processor-based System-on-Chips (SoCs) designed 
for high-performance mobile devices. We will continue this manufacturing leadership as we begin production of our 5th generation 
Intel Core processors (code-named “Broadwell”) on our next-generation 14nm process technology this year.
Accelerating mobility
The world of mobile client computing is expanding to include not only notebook computers and tablets, but also 2 in 1 devices that 
combine the best features of notebooks and tablets. We are taking aggressive steps to move swiftly in all of these market segments 
and to grow with them. Last year, we established a footprint in the tablet market with the shipment of more than 10 million micro-
processors, and for 2014 we have set an aggressive goal to increase that number to 40 million. We also made significant advances 
in our 3G and 4G (LTE) communications capabilities in 2013. This year we are driving faster integration of these communications 
technologies into our SoCs.
Reinvigorating innovation
We are reinvigorating innovation at Intel and bringing it to market faster. For example, in September 2013 we introduced Intel® Quark™ 
technology. This technology is designed for applications in fast-growing markets such as wearables and the “Internet of Things,” 
where the priorities are extremely small size and very low power consumption. We also announced innovative products such as  
the Intel® Galileo development board, the first Intel architecture-based Arduino*-compatible board to support the maker and  
education communities; and the Intel® Edison development platform, a general-purpose computer housed in a tiny form factor designed 
to enable rapid innovation by inventors, entrepreneurs, and product designers. Neither of these products was on our roadmaps 
before mid-2013. You will continue to see a faster pace of innovation moving forward. 
Our commitment to corporate responsibility
Corporate responsibility is an enduring Intel value that delivers returns for our company, stockholders, and society. In 2013, we  
continued to expand education opportunities for millions of students around the world, we were again the largest voluntary purchaser 
of green power in the U.S., and our employees donated more than 1 million volunteer hours to their communities. I am especially 
proud of our leadership in the area of “conflict minerals.” We have worked for five years to ensure that our products do not contain 
tantalum, tin, tungsten, or gold that finances or benefits armed groups in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and adjoining 
countries. In 2013, we accomplished our goal to manufacture microprocessors that are DRC conflict-free.
Prepared for the opportunities ahead
I believe we have great opportunities ahead of us. Intel has leading products and technologies for growing markets, a strong work-
force, and a heritage of leadership in driving Moore’s Law. We have sharpened our product focus and are accelerating the pace of  
our innovation. I look forward to growing stockholder return by delivering industry-leading products for a dynamic and changing 
marketplace and ensuring that “If it computes, it does it best with Intel.” 
Brian M. Krzanich, Chief Executive Officer
Past performance does not guarantee future results. This Annual Report to Stockholders contains forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ materially. Risk factors 
that could cause actual results to differ are set forth in the “Risk Factors” section and throughout our 2013 Form 10-K, which is included in this Annual Report. These risk factors are 
subject to update by our future SEC filings and earnings releases.

Financial Results
When I joined Intel in the early 1980’s, the company was respected 
as an innovator whose founders had developed a strong and ethical 
culture. As the decade progressed, Intel faced life-threatening 
challenges, including a shortage of capital, operating losses and 
fierce competition. With tough-minded strategies and a determi-
nation to lead, the company adapted and built a vibrant future 
with its core values intact. In technology, those who continue to  
innovate create new opportunities. In the years since, I have seen this pattern of 
regeneration often repeated. Today is another defining time for Intel, with big issues, 
big possibilities, and a resilient culture.

Intel enters 2014 with leadership positions in important business segments, includ-
ing client computing, the data center, software, embedded systems, and NAND flash 
memory. These businesses generated significant financial results in 2013, indicated 
by high levels of profits, strong cash generation, and a healthy balance sheet. This 
performance enabled Intel to deliver tangible value for stockholders, with $4.5 billion 
paid in dividends and $2.1 billion spent to repurchase shares, bringing the cumulative 
return to stockholders from dividends and repurchases to $125 billion. 
  While these accomplishments are notable, we need to do more.

It is imperative that we move swiftly to be more competitive in the market for 
tablets. We must also protect and grow Intel’s core businesses while at the same time 
pursuing new opportunities for growth. And we need to do more to provide the  
30
integrated solutions customers increasingly seek.

Just as important, we must never forget what Moore’s Law tells us about the future: 
computing devices will continually get smaller, lower cost, and higher performing, and 
can also be more mobile. The tablet is an extension of our history, and we should have  
recognized its potential sooner.

These considerations were top of mind in 2013 as the Board of Directors searched 
for a new CEO. We wanted someone who would look at markets from a fresh perspec-
tive. We needed to be a leaner, more agile company attuned and reacting to the world 
around it. And we needed a renewed focus on accountability and results—and to see

things as they are, not as we hope they would be. As always, we insisted on a person 
who would put Intel’s success and stockholder return first.

The challenges Intel faces are not new. Every year, nay-sayers predict that technology 
50
has reached its limits and opportunities have diminished. Yet innovation never stops, 
and technology continues to transform the way people go about their lives. I believe 
40
the opportunities are as big and interesting as at any time in Intel’s history. 
30
     Before the microprocessor was invented, Intel founder Gordon Moore predicted that 
20
integrated electronics would one day be available throughout all of society. Even  
today Gordon is surprised to see this technology extend beyond anything he and his  
10
colleagues imagined. You see technology everywhere, and silicon is the foundation. 
As technology has become more pervasive, the responsibility for how it is made 
04
and deployed has become more important. The people who work at Intel share the 
public’s concerns about safety, security, privacy and sustainability. They are highly 
motivated by the prospect that the products they make can be used to improve the  
way people live. The question, “What is good for our business?” is answered with an eye 
to what is good for the people who own our shares, the people who use our products, 
and the people who work with us around the world. 
  Our clarity on this front has allowed the five Intel CEOs with whom I’ve worked 
25
to make more confident strategic decisions, because they know what matters to the 
20.8
20
company. Nothing gives me greater confidence in our future.
