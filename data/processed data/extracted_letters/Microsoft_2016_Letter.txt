Dear shareholders, customers, partners, and employees:  
I’m proud of the progress we’ve made as a company this past year and excited about the opportunity for even more progress 
in the  year ahead. We’ve advanced our mission to  empower every person  and  every organization on the planet  to 
achieve  more.  We’ve  continued  to  cultivate  a  Microsoft  culture  in  which  people  connect  their  individual  energies  and 
passions for technology to this mission. We’re leading profound digital transformation both for people and institutions. We’ve 
achieved strong financial results. And we’re building a sturdy foundation for an even brighter future.  
We generated $85.3 billion in revenue, $52.5 billion in gross margin, and $20.2 billion in operating income this past fiscal 
year. Adjusting for Windows 10 revenue deferrals and impairment, integration and restructuring expenses, revenue was 
$92.0 billion with $27.9 billion in operating income. Even as we invested in innovation and expanded geographically, we 
maintained our commitment to shareholder return and increased our total cash return to $26.1 billion, up 12 percent from 
last  fiscal  year.  These  results  reflect  exciting  new  product  innovations  as  well  as  increases  in  customer  usage  and 
engagement across our businesses:  
•   Commercial cloud annualized revenue run rate exceeded $12.1 billion, up more than 50 percent year-over-year.  
•   More than 70 million people use Office 365 commercial every single month.  
•   Revenue from our cloud platform, Azure, grew triple digits, with usage of key computing and database workloads 
more than doubling year-over-year.  
•   Windows 10 is now active on more than 400 million devices around the world and over 197 billion hours of usage. 
This is the fastest adoption rate of any prior Windows release. 
•   Bing  has  leveraged  this  incredible  usage  to  become  profitable  with  search  advertising  revenue  up  17 percent, 
excluding traffic acquisition costs.  
•   Xbox Live monthly active users grew 33 percent year-over-year to 49 million.  
Over the past year, Microsoft has built momentum in each of its reportable segments, which is detailed below, but it’s the 
larger opportunity – how technology can inspire and ignite change and renewal – that I want to emphasize in this year’s 
letter.  
A transformational opportunity  
Microsoft is uniquely positioned in this era of massive business and societal transformation. We’re the company that cares 
most deeply about computing technologies for both people and the organizations they build. Our entire purpose is to make 
things that help our customers make things – and make things happen. We build the platforms upon which others build 
digital platforms. After all, each of us, as individuals, is trying to build something that outlasts ourselves, whether that’s a 
small business, a school, a clinic, or an enterprise. 
Over the years Microsoft has experienced great success, and today we are just at the beginning of an incredible new wave 
of opportunity. The next generation of ubiquitous computing and ambient intelligence is going to transform every life, every 
industry, and every country.  
What  this  means  for  organizations  is  that  Microsoft  is  their  partner  in  digital  transformation  –  engaging  customers, 
empowering employees, optimizing operations, and transforming products. What it means for people is that Microsoft helps 
them get more out of every moment – creating, collaborating, learning, gaming, being mobile, and staying secure.  
Let’s look at how we’re doing this within each segment.

Productivity and Business Processes  
Productivity  is  in  our  DNA,  and  so  everything  we  do  supports  our  customers’  digital  work  and  life.  Nowhere  is  digital 
transformation more evident than how we live and work today. We work on the go. We are on more teams, both inside and 
outside the company. We don’t have time for the information we need personally and professionally to live in different silos.  
We’re not simply building individual tools, but rather designing an intelligent fabric based on four principles – collaboration, 
mobility, intelligence, and trust. People still do important work as individuals, but collaboration is the new norm, so we build 
our tools to empower teams. We aspire to help everyone be productive no matter where they are, regardless of the device 
they use. Your data, apps, and settings – all of your content – roam with you across your computing experiences. Intelligence 
is an amazing force multiplier. To be successful amid the explosion of data, people need analytics, services, and agents 
that  use  intelligence  to  help  them  manage  their  scarcest  resource  –  time.  Finally,  trust  is  the  foundation  upon  which 
everything we do is built. That’s why we are investing deeply in security and compliance that set the standard for enterprise-
grade productivity.  
The two pillars of this ambition are Office 365 and Dynamics 365.  
Office 365 is changing the nature of work for individuals and teams. Customers love the power of Office on Windows and 
Mac as well as their iOS and Android mobile devices. In fact, Office is on more than 50 million iOS and Android monthly 
active devices, up more than four times over last year. Industry analyst surveys report that in cloud email, Microsoft is the 
clear choice. And we continue to see great momentum as innovative companies like GE, Facebook, Hershey, and Discovery 
Communications adopt Office 365.  
We recently launched Dynamics 365 to empower business users with built-in insights and intelligence, accessed from within 
the business applications they’re working on – cloud-based apps like field service, sales, finance, and operations. It is deeply 
integrated with Office 365 to bring together all of the capabilities people need to get their jobs done. Business process tools 
in the past were hostage to silos of information and monolithic suites of applications. We’re removing those impedances by 
bringing together communications and collaboration capabilities so they work seamlessly for every role. Overall, Dynamics 
365 builds on a strong base of nearly 10 million monthly paid seats, up more than 20 percent year-over-year. And in this 
past year, we saw Dynamics CRM Online seat additions more than double year-over-year, driving overall Dynamics revenue 
growth.  
This year Microsoft and LinkedIn announced our agreement to join forces to connect the world’s professional cloud and the 
world’s professional network – creating new experiences and new value for users. Together we will have a transformative 
effect through our  shared ambition to reinvent ways for  professionals to be more productive. With more than  1.2 billion 
Office users and 433 million LinkedIn members, our combined data graphs will forever change how Sales, HR, and other 
professionals get work done. Meetings will get better when Cortana can draw on your professional network to connect the 
dots so you stay one step ahead. Your online newsfeed will become more intelligent as the professional cloud and network 
tailor information to what’s going on at work, upcoming meetings, and projects underway. This acquisition will grow our total 
addressable  market  by  creating  a  vibrant  network  that  brings  together  a  professional’s  information  in  LinkedIn’s  public 
network with the information created in Office 365 and Dynamics 365.  
Looking ahead, our vision is to teach human language to all of the computing experiences that surround us. We imagine a 
world in which a deeply personal agent understands you, your organization, and your world, helping you get more out of 
every moment. Skype and Outlook with their hundreds of millions of users already are conversational canvases that will 
increasingly become rich platforms for getting every task done with new applications in the form of bots.  
Intelligent Cloud  
Our ambition to build the intelligent cloud is closely  linked with the previous ambition.  In fact, together with cloud-based 
applications  like  Office  365  and  Dynamics  365,  we  are  on  track  to  achieve  $20  billion  in  commercial  cloud  annualized 
revenue run rate in fiscal year 2018.

Every  organization  needs  new  cloud-based  infrastructure  and  applications  that  can  convert  vast  amounts  of  data  into 
predictive  and  analytical  power  through  the  use  of  advanced  machine  learning,  analytics,  and  cognitive  services.  The 
combination  of  Azure’s  infrastructure  and  data  services  makes  it  possible  for  businesses  to  build  digital  transformation 
applications that better engage customers, optimize operations, and transform products and business models.  
From an infrastructure perspective, we’ve continued to deliver on the promise of a global, hyperscale cloud platform with 30 
unique Azure regions around the world. For perspective, we cover more countries and regions than any other cloud provider, 
from North America, to Asia, to Europe, to Latin America. We’re continuing to invest billions of dollars each year to build out 
more and more infrastructure. What this means for our customers is that they can scale their solutions without worrying 
about their cloud platform’s capacity or the complex demands of transparency, reliability, security, privacy, and compliance. 
In essence, we’re meeting their real-world needs both for today and tomorrow.  
The Microsoft Cloud is open and offers choice. We broadly support a wide range of platforms and developer tools on Azure. 
Our acquisition of Xamarin, and our work with Red Hat, Docker, Mesosphere, and others reflect our commitment to working 
cross-platform. Nearly a third of customer virtual machines on Azure run Linux.  
We are building our server products to become the edge of our cloud, supporting true hybrid computing. SQL Server 2016, 
Windows Server 2016, and System Center 2016 as well as Azure Stack enable customers to build a cloud platform that 
spans their own data centers and the public cloud.  
Revenue within the Intelligent Cloud segment alone increased $1.3 billion, or 6 percent, driven in part by impressive gains 
in our Azure business. Azure revenue and usage grew by more than 100 percent in the final quarter of the year. More than 
70 percent of the Fortune 500 have at least two different Microsoft Cloud offerings. And more than 80 percent of the world’s 
largest banks are Azure customers. We clearly are now one of the two enterprise cloud leaders.  
It’s not just infrastructure driving this growth, but also the intelligence we infuse into applications. Customers such as Boeing, 
Jabil Circuit, and Land O’Lakes are using Microsoft’s industry-leading data management, machine learning, analytics, and 
cognitive services to infuse intelligence into their applications. The integration of cloud-based cognitive services like Cortana 
is just the tip of the spear, and will fuel our vision for conversation as a platform. We have more than 20 cognitive services 
APIs today, including for vision, speech, text, recommendations, and face and emotion detection. Developers use these 
APIs within their applications to augment users’ experiences by enabling solutions to see, hear, speak, and interpret the 
world around them. Our intelligent cloud is democratizing these capabilities for startups, small businesses, and enterprises 
alike.  
More Personal Computing  
Just as we are transforming business and society through cloud computing, we’re also revolutionizing the workplace to help 
organizations be more productive, and people do more. This was the year of reinventing Windows and delivering a renewed 
vision of one of the world’s most successful operating systems. We launched Windows 10 with a new concept – to enable 
Windows as a service, continuously delivering differentiated value across our ecosystem to better serve the needs of our 
customers. We engineered Windows 10 to enable innovative and more natural ways to interact and engage with devices – 
ask a question with your voice, draw with the flick of a pen, and secure your most important things with a smile or a touch. 
These experiences place users at the center so they can move seamlessly across all devices – from the PC, Xbox, phones, 
and Surface Hub, to mixed reality with Microsoft HoloLens and Windows Holographic.  
With an installed base of more than 1 billion Windows devices – more than 400 million of which are already on Windows 10 
and its 197 billion hours of usage – we have an opportunity to offer new experiences and deepen our engagement with 
Windows  users. We  see  opportunities  to  innovate  and  grow  in  areas  such  as  productivity  and  gaming,  bringing  these 
experiences to every device. And we continue to inspire new, innovative device categories like the two-in-one Surface, the 
pioneering HoloLens, and over 1,500 new Windows devices designed with our OEM partners.

Led by state-of-the-art security, Windows 10 is starting to drive digital transformation for customers in the enterprise. The 
U.S. Department of Defense and Accenture are just a few of the customers deploying Windows 10 to millions of employees 
to help protect them with industry-leading security features like Credential Guard, Device Guard, Windows Hello, and new 
cloud-based  security  services  like  Windows  Defender  Advanced  Threat  Protection.  Our  belief  in  building  world-class 
enterprise security in Windows has contributed to nearly every one of our enterprise customers piloting Windows 10 this 
past fiscal year.  
Windows is also built to support everyday experiences for everyone. Cortana  – the first truly personal digital assistant – 
came to life in Windows 10. Embedded within Windows 10, Cortana gets to know each user, helping to get things done, to 
organize schedules, respond to questions – all through natural user interaction. And by learning more about the user over 
time, Cortana becomes increasingly useful every day. The Windows 10 Cortana search box has over 126 million monthly 
active users, and has been asked 12 billion questions to date. In turn, this intensity and frequency of usage helped drive 
Bing’s U.S. PC query share to nearly 22 percent in the final quarter of our past fiscal year.  
Gaming is another area where Windows 10 will open new user experiences and scenarios. Gaming has been among the 
leading drivers of engagement on Windows 10, with more than 17.5 billion hours of gameplay on Windows 10 PCs in its 
first year. Xbox Live is connecting fans across Windows 10, iOS, and Android. Microsoft has an incredibly engaged gaming 
audience on Xbox Live with 49 million monthly users and growing – up 33 percent year-over-year. This growth is driven in 
part by strong franchises like Minecraft, which has sold more than 106 million copies to date. In fact, Xbox Live players of 
Minecraft increased 62 percent in the last year. Our gaming roadmap over the next 18 months is anchored by two significant 
console releases – Xbox One S and Project Scorpio – and investments in growth areas such as virtual reality, video, and 
eSports.  
We continue to grow the Windows ecosystem by creating new computing categories. Surface, Surface Hub, and Microsoft 
HoloLens have pushed the boundaries of how personal the computing experience can be, with Surface Book and Surface 
Pro  4  released  in  the  last  year. Forward-looking  customers  like  Rolls  Royce,  the  PGA  Tour,  Japan  Airlines,  and  Volvo 
already  are  embracing  Microsoft  HoloLens  and  the  Windows  Holographic  platform,  transforming  the  way  they  work  by 
breaking down the barriers between virtual and physical reality. We are excited about these future growth areas but are 
also committed to ensuring that we are investing thoughtfully across our portfolio. Over the past fiscal year, we increased 
investment  in  key  capabilities  within  Windows  10  and  in  new  growth  markets,  while  at  the  same  time  scaling  back  our 
investment commensurate with the opportunity in areas like phone.  
Across each of these ambitions, Microsoft made significant progress this past year. And we’re investing in a future that is 
even more exciting.  
Investing in the Future  
Earlier  in  this  letter  I  described  the  transformational  opportunities  that  lie  ahead,  particularly  in  the  realm  of  digital 
intelligence. We’re growing today’s core businesses and technologies, incubating for the future and investing in long-term 
computing breakthroughs. Within our research labs we’re hard at work on advanced machine learning – artificial intelligence 
– that will produce forewarnings that can put an end to distracted driving and one day identify a crisis like Zika before it 
happens. Quantum computing, theorized for decades by some of the world’s greatest minds as a way to harness the very 
building  blocks  of  matter  and  energy  for  unimaginable  computing  capabilities  and  intelligence,  is  emerging  today  as  a 
feasible technology. Its realization will bring new power to cure disease and address global challenges like climate change. 
Our people and partners right now are solving the hard problems of experimental and theoretical physics, mathematics, and 
computer science that will accelerate quantum computing’s becoming a reality.  
And that brings us right back to our mission – to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve 
more.

Computing and societal impact  
Last year I concluded this letter committing that we would continue to ask ourselves what are the challenges humankind 
faces,  how can technology  help, and what  is the contribution of Microsoft? To me, these questions are essential to the 
rediscovery of the soul of Microsoft, and more broadly, the purpose of global companies in society. This past year we’ve 
witnessed movements that understandably question globalization and its impact on economic equality. With worldwide per 
capita GDP and productivity  growth at  roughly 1  percent,  how do we  return to  vigorous growth that  benefits everyone? 
That’s  part  of  what  we’re  working  to  address  both  through  our  core  business  and  through  our  broader  work  societally, 
including this past year with the founding of Microsoft Philanthropies.  
When I meet with leaders in every part of the world, I hear their desire to work with Microsoft to create world class, cloud-
enabled platforms, and  applications  that advance  health, education,  and economic growth,  locally  in their countries and 
communities. That is what inspires me most. And it’s why we are working with public and private sector partners to promote 
a public cloud for public good  – expanding affordable internet connectivity, building  next generation  skills, and fostering 
policies that promote trustworthy computing in the cloud. This past year we announced that Microsoft Philanthropies will 
donate $1 billion in public cloud computing for nonprofits around the world.  
Throughout our discussions with LinkedIn this year, I was struck in my conversations with founder Reid Hoffman and CEO 
Jeff  Weiner  that  we  share  a  commitment  to  more  directly  and  more  evenly  spread  opportunity  for  everyone.  In  fact, 
LinkedIn’s vision has been to create economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce – all 3 billion of them 
– by building the world’s first economic graph, a digital representation of the global economy and opportunity. The goal is 
to  make  labor  markets  work  better  for  everyone  by  making  them  more  efficient  and  open.  Together  we  aspire  to  help 
everyone navigate an increasingly challenging global economy more effectively.  
In conclusion, the test of any brand is its ability to have measurable impact and to remain relevant over time. Microsoft has 
done this in times of transition by innovating boldly. When I walk the hallways of Microsoft and talk with our talented people, 
the sense of purpose and urgency in realizing our mission through world class innovation is unmistakable.
