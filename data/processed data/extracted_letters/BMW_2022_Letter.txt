DEAR SHAREHOLDERS,
The year 2022 was a challenging, but nonetheless successful one for the BMW Group. 
The ongoing war in Ukraine is a human tragedy that moves us all deeply. In economic 
terms, too, the conflict has had a massive impact, with severe repercussions for vital supply 
chains. The general situation was also exacerbated by repeated lockdowns in China and 
numerous bottlenecks affecting semiconductor availability. However, despite these adverse 
geo political and macroeconomic circumstances, the BMW Group performed well in 2022 
within the competitive environment. With around 2.4 million vehicles sold and the production 
of all-electric vehicles making good progress, the BMW Group has clearly demonstrated 
that a strong product portfolio is the best response to a challenging environment. 
We got off to a flying start in 2023 with the unveiling of the BMW i Vision Dee at the Con-
sumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. “Dee” stands for Digital Emotional Experience, a 
new form of interaction between people and their cars in which genuine driving pleasure 
and the virtual world merge seamlessly. With this vehicle, BMW has already arrived in the 
future in terms of digitalisation!
For 2023, we intend to maintain our firm course of profitable growth and press ahead with 
the ramping up of electric mobility. We are convinced that the future of the BMW Group is 
electric, digital and circular – and it has already begun! 
Norbert Reithofer
Chairman of the Supervisory Board

Report of the Supervisory Board
Focus of Supervisory Board activities during the past financial year
The Supervisory Board performed the duties incumbent upon it with the utmost diligence 
throughout the financial year 2022. 
and risk management measures on a regular basis. The latest developments in the semi-
conductor supply situation were also  discussed at each meeting. 
Based on in-depth reports presented by the Board of Management, in our capacity as a 
supervisory body we assiduously monitored the governance of the BMW Group and advised 
the Board of Management on matters relating to the management and strategic develop-
ment of the Group. We focused in particular on the progressive electrification of the Group’s 
product portfolio and on implementing the corporate strategies adopted in the fields of 
digitalisation and sustainability. At each of the five plenary sessions of the Supervisory 
Board (including two two-day meetings), we held detailed discussions with the Board 
of Management regarding the Group’s situation, addressing a variety of topics, including 
the risks associated with the ongoing global uncertainty and risk management. The 
Board of Management also kept the Supervisory Board well informed of any matters of 
significance outside the framework of formal meetings. I also discussed key current 
 matters personally with the Chairman of the Board of Management between meetings on 
a regular basis. In addition to scheduled meetings, the Chairman of the Audit Committee 
was also in direct contact with the Board of Management member responsible for Finance 
as well as with the external  auditor’s representatives. Furthermore, we regularly dealt 
with personnel-related matters as well as internal Supervisory Board issues without the 
presence of the Board of Management. 
Within the Supervisory Board and its committees, dialogues were always conducted in an 
open and constructive spirit, both internally and together with members of the Board of 
Management. Detailed documents distributed in a timely manner prior to meetings enabled 
members to prepare appropriately for the topics up for discussion. In addition, separate 
preliminary meetings of the shareholder and employee representatives were held on a 
regular basis prior to Supervisory Board meetings.
In its reports on the BMW Group’s position, the Board of Management kept us well 
 informed at each meeting regarding current developments and the Group’s overall perfor-
mance. A regular topic of discussion was the development of current sales trends based 
on figures analysed by brand, segment and market region for both the BMW Group and its 
competitors, with a keen focus on electrified vehicles. An overview of key financial indica-
tors and the liquidity situation of the BMW Group was also an integral part of these reports. 
In view of the far-reaching consequences of the war in Ukraine, including the impact on 
business in Russia and the recurrent coronavirus -related lockdowns in China, we were pro-
vided with up-to-date information on current  developments, risks to business performance 
The monitoring of corporate strategy also remained high on the Supervisory Board’s 
agenda. The Board of Management provided an in-depth account of its strategies, focus-
ing on the automotive sector’s transformation in the fields of electrification, digitalisation 
and the circular economy and emphasising the importance of the NEUE KLASSE as a huge 
leap in terms of product features. The latest purchasing strategies in place were also 
 explained to us in great depth. Growing challenges in relation to supply chain management 
and the ongoing trend towards technology clusters were both discussed at considerable 
length. Particular attention was paid to the Catena-X platform, a cross-company network 
designed to improve supply security and carbon emissions management throughout 
the supply chain using standardised data exchange systems. The overall market situation 
as well as the outlook for automated driving were also subjects of the Board of Manage-
ment’s reports. In conjunction with the information provided on the topic of sustainability, 
the Board of Management reaffirmed the BMW Group’s ambitious decarbonisation targets 
for the year 2030. 
At each meeting, the Board of Management updated us on the current status of its strategy- 
and project-related work as well as the progress being made in implementing its declared 
strategy of environmental sustainability. These updates also included current events such 
as the opening of the Lydia plant in China, which is fully geared to e-mobility production, 
the start of production of fuel cell systems at the BMW Group’s in-house competence centre 
for hydrogen in Munich, the market launch of the all-electric BMW iX1 as well as the found-
ing of the “Circular Republic” initiative in collaboration with UnternehmerTUM GmbH on all 
aspects of the circular economy.
Moreover, the Board of Management reported to us on other current topics, such as the 
highly successful presentation of the new BMW 7 Series in Palm Springs, USA, the activi-
ties surrounding the 100th anniversary of the BMW plant and the 50th anniversary of 
the BMW Group’s “Vierzylinder” tower in Munich, the unveiling of the Spectre, the first 
all-electric Rolls-Royce, and the eight IQS Quality Awards received for five of our vehicle 
models as well as three of the BMW Group’s plants.
On several occasions we deliberated on major changes affecting the legal framework 
and/or regulatory projects that are of significance to the BMW Group, in particular the 
EU’s regulations regarding fleet carbon emissions in conjunction with the EU’s “Fit for 55” 
package and the Euro 7 emissions standards.

Report of the Supervisory Board
Furthermore, the Supervisory Board closely monitored developments relating to major 
strategic cooperations. In 2022, the focus was particularly on the Chinese market, with 
 respect to both the BMW Brilliance Automotive joint venture, in which the BMW Group was 
able to increase its share to 75 % with effect from 11 February 2022, and the cooperation 
with Great Wall Motors for the local production of an all-electric MINI. The Board of Manage-
ment updated us on the current status of these projects at each meeting. In light of the 
sale of SHARE NOW, we were also kept informed of strategic developments at YOUR NOW 
as well as the strengthening of the BMW Group’s luxury segment product range through 
the acquisition of the ALPINA brand.
The development of the BMW Group’s equity and considerations undertaken by the 
Board of Management regarding the possible implementation of a share buyback pro-
gramme were further key items on our agenda. Based on the rationale provided by the 
Board of Management, we approved the resolution proposed to the Annual General Meeting 
to authorise the acquisition of treasury shares. At the same time, the Supervisory Board 
stipulated a requirement to obtain the Supervisory Board’s approval in certain cases of 
share buybacks and assigned responsibility for deciding on such approval to the Audit 
Committee. 
The Supervisory Board reviewed the targeted, maximum and expected level of Board of 
Management remuneration for the financial year 2022 in light of the BMW Group’s busi-
ness performance as well as the multi-year remuneration trend of its senior executives and 
employees within Germany. Based on a comparative study conducted by an external inde-
pendent remuneration consultant and subsequent oral advice, we concluded that both the 
remuneration paid to Board of Management members for the financial year 2021 and the 
target remuneration for 2022 are appropriate. In December 2022, following thorough prepa-
ration by the Personnel Committee, we adopted the variable remuneration targets appli-
cable to Board of Management members for the financial year 2023, taking into account the 
budget for 2023, the long-term business plan and the Group’s corporate strategy. Detailed 
information on Board of Management remuneration for the financial year 2022 is provided 
in the Remuneration Report. 
In addition, we deliberated upon key issues arising within the Board of Management’s 
various key areas of responsibility in the course of our work. We carefully considered 
the planned realignment of the BMW Group’s retail operations in specified regions to an 
agency model based on a presentation explaining the objectives, implementation steps 
and plans for individual European markets. The European market as a whole was also the 
subject of an in-depth sales report. 
The fundamental structures of the BMW Group’s risk management system as well as the 
key elements of its risk strategy were clearly set out for us in the detailed Risk Report. In 
 addition, various scenarios and risk mitigation measures were discussed regarding a range 
of topics of current relevance for the key areas Development, Purchasing, Production and 
Sales. The Board of Management also reported to us on the strategy, performance, sector- 
specific risk profile and current projects of the Financial Services line of business. Key 
topics relating to the Group’s financing system were also discussed at length.
During the year under report, we reviewed the strategies pursued by Human Resources, 
including maintaining the attractiveness of the BMW Group as an employer. The Board of 
Management also brought us up to date on the current status of the diversity concepts 
 developed by the Group and the extent to which targets have been achieved regarding the 
proportion of women employed at various levels. 
We also gave thorough consideration to the current status, maturity and evolution of the 
Group’s compliance management system. In his annual report, the Chief Compliance 
 Officer presented the key stages of development that have been defined for this system 
and provided an insight into a number of individual projects, including in particular the 
 implementation of the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act. 
In December 2021, the Supervisory Board agreed to the initial plan to hold the 2022 Annual 
General Meeting on a virtual basis in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic and in March 
2022, the detailed concept proposed by the Board of Management was approved. In Decem-
ber 2022, the Supervisory Board also agreed to hold the 2023 Annual General Meeting 
on a virtual basis, particularly in view of the higher level of planning certainty and the lower 
consumption of resources. In this context, it will be ensured that shareholders can exercise 
their rights on an equivalent basis to an AGM held in person.
I personally hold discussions with investor representatives on topics specific to the Super-
visory Board on a regular basis. Key topics discussed during the past financial year included 
corporate-governance-relevant issues such as targets for the composition of the Super-
visory Board, the Remuneration Report and arrangements for the Annual General Meeting. 
Another topic of these discussions was the  Supervisory Board’s dealing with the corpo-
rate strategy, in particular with regard to sustainability targets set by the BMW Group.

Report of the Supervisory Board
The BMW Group’s long-term business plan was subjected to comprehensive examination. 
Focusing on the transformation towards sustainable mobility, the Board of Management 
presented its forecasts for the various segments as well as ambitious long-term targets set 
for the Group. The key targets of profitable growth across all segments and sales growth 
of all-electric models were both reaffirmed. The Board of Management also reported on 
financial planning as well as opportunity and risk scenarios pertaining to the Automotive 
segment. Following thorough examination, the Supervisory Board approved the long-term 
business plan drawn up by the Board of Management. 
In December, the Board of Management presented the budget for the financial year 2023. 
After detailed discussion with the Board of Management, including the particular challenges 
in view of the uncertain and volatile overall situation, we gave our approval to this docu-
ment as well.
Based on the new version of the German Corporate Governance Code, we have continued 
to develop the BMW Group’s system of corporate governance, including a revision of 
the competence profile stipulated for the Supervisory Board as one particular contribution. 
A qualification matrix showing each individual Supervisory Board member’s areas of 
 expertise is provided in the Statement of Corporate Governance on the BMW Group web-
site. Based on a self-assessment, we concluded that the composition of the Supervisory 
Board at 31 December 2022 fully meets the targets stipulated in the diversity concept and 
the competency profile.
In light of the major significance attached to sustainability-related topics, the tasks assigned 
to the Audit Committee and the Presiding Board in this respect have now been delineated 
more clearly in our Rules of Procedure.
In the Declaration of Compliance with the German Corporate Governance Code issued in 
December 2022, the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board confirmed that they 
have complied with the recommendations of the Code as amended on 16 December 2019 
without exception. Moreover, we have fully complied with the recommendations contained 
in the latest version of the Code dated 28 April 2022 and intend to continue doing so going 
forward. 
With BMW AG’s support, Supervisory Board members received further training on various 
topics during 2022. In March, for instance, in training sessions with representatives of the 
auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft (PwC), we took 
an in-depth look at current and future frameworks applicable for non-financial reporting 
and familiarised ourselves with EU Taxonomy regulations. At our two-day meeting held in 
July, our agenda also gave us the opportunity to gain an insight into digital, AI-supported 
factory planning (“BMW iFACTORY”) at the Dingolfing plant, the BMW Group’s largest pro-
duction location in Europe. In this context, we were informed about the key aspects of the 
“Lean, Green, Digital” concept for sustainable, digital production systems. 
In September, motivated in part by a keynote speech made by an external speaker on 
the future of e-mobility from the perspective of an energy company and grid operator, we 
looked at the challenges arising relating to the availability of energy supplies on the one 
hand and the expansion of charging infrastructure in Germany on the other. Furthermore, 
the Supervisory Board members had the opportunity to test-drive various vehicles with 
 different drive systems at the BMW and MINI Driving Academy in Maisach near Munich. In 
addition, we were given a preview of the architecture, design, display and operating con-
cept of the NEUE KLASSE, including a whole host of innovative features. Last but not least, 
in December we discussed the perception of the BMW Group on the capital market with 
an external capital market expert familiar with the automotive sector.
The onboarding programme for new Supervisory Board members was continued in 2022, 
with representatives of the Group’s specialist departments taking the time to provide useful 
insights into the key business areas as well as the planning processes deployed at the 
BMW Group. New members were also introduced to the ongoing work of the Supervisory 
Board. 
Towards the end of 2022, we reviewed the effectiveness of the work of the Supervisory 
Board and its committees with the aid of a questionnaire, the results of which were dis-
cussed at the meeting. Cooperation, within the Supervisory Board itself and with the Board 
of Management, was unanimously assessed as being constructive and fruitful. We are 
 already planning to follow up on a number of suggestions in 2023 with a view to increasing 
our understanding of specific topics, in particular individual aspects of the BMW Group’s 
sustainability strategy, such as hydrogen technology and sustainable energy generation at 
a BMW site.

Report of the Supervisory Board
The Supervisory Board is careful to avoid any conflicts of interest in the course of its delib-
erations and decision-making processes. No conflicts of interest were either reported or 
identified during the financial year 2022. 
Description of Presiding Board activities and committee work 
The Supervisory Board has established a Presiding Board and four committees. The 
Chairman of the Audit Committee, Dr Bock, and myself reported in detail on the work of the 
 Presiding Committee as well as the committees at each of the subsequent Supervisory 
Board meetings. Further information on the duties, composition and working methods of 
the Presiding Board as well as the committees is provided in the Statement of Corporate 
Governance on our website.
Unless a particular committee was responsible, the Presiding Board prepared the content 
of the topics for the plenary meetings at its four meetings in cooperation with the Board 
of Management and senior heads of department and made suggestions for topics to be 
reported on at Supervisory Board meetings. 
The Audit Committee convened eight times in total. 
In February and March 2022, the focus was on preparing the Supervisory Board meeting 
at which the financial statements for the financial year 2021 were discussed and examined. 
After considering the matter of independence, the Audit Committee recommended to the 
Supervisory Board that PwC be proposed for election as auditor at the 2022 Annual General 
Meeting. There were no indications of conflicts of interest, grounds for exclusion or lack of 
 independence on the part of the auditor. 
The Audit Committee concluded that PwC’s fee proposal for the audit of the Company and 
Group Financial Statements and the BMW Group Report 2022 as well as for the review of 
the Half-Year Report 2022 was appropriate in light of the scope of its tasks and issued the 
corresponding contracts to PwC following their election at the Annual General Meeting in 
May 2022. The Audit Committee also specified supplementary audit focus areas. Moreover, 
it approved the scope of the non-audit services to be performed by PwC, the progress of 
which was reported to us on a regular basis. At its meetings, the Audit Committee discussed 
the quality of the audit in depth on several occasions. In particular, it requested the relevant 
department to report on the Group’s perception of the audits of the financial statements for 
the financial year 2021 as well as on the results of the survey conducted within the Group in 
this context. Based on this report, the auditor’s description of the quality assurance meas-
ures undertaken and the Audit Committee’s own experience with the auditor, the audit was 
found to be of good quality. 
We also examined the combined Non-financial Statement of BMW AG and the BMW Group 
for the financial year 2021, which is part of the BMW Group Report. Here, too, the represent-
atives of PwC reported to us on the findings of their audit. We have again engaged PwC to 
conduct a “limited assurance” audit of the Non-financial (Group) Statement for the finan-
cial year 2022, to the extent that it relates to parts of the management report that are not 
subject to a “reasonable assurance” audit. Going beyond the formal review required by 
law, the Audit Committee also engaged PwC to audit the contents of the Remuneration 
Report for the financial year 2022.
The Quarterly Statements were presented by the Board of Management and discussed 
with the Audit Committee prior to their publication. Representatives of the external auditors 
were present when the Half-Year Financial Report was discussed at the beginning of 
 August 2022. 
Furthermore, the Audit Committee considered the development of the BMW Group’s equity 
and the share buyback programme 2022/2023 proposed by the Board of Management. 
Based on the responsibility vested in it by the Supervisory Board, the Audit Committee gave 
its approval to the programme in June.
The Audit Committee considered the effectiveness and appropriateness of the BMW Group’s 
internal control system (including the Corporate Audit function and the compliance man-
agement system) as well as of the risk management system, focusing in particular on the 
current risk situation and the assessment of risk scenarios. We regularly monitor develop-
ments in the internal control system for non-financial reporting, with regard to the Group’s 
sustainability-related targets. We also had Corporate Audit reports on the key findings 
of internal audits and the status of both ongoing and planned audits explained to us. The 
Chief Compliance Officer of the BMW Group reported on changes in the BMW Group’s 
compliance management system in terms of strategic focus as well as on the implementa-
tion of operational measures and further planning. We also received a report on the status 
of the Tax and Customs Control System from the relevant head of department. The in-house 
General Counsel provided us with detailed information regarding major legal disputes and 
proceedings. We also requested information on important product quality issues.

Report of the Supervisory Board
In its report on the audit of over-the-counter derivatives entered into by BMW AG during the 
financial year 2021, the external auditor confirmed to the Audit Committee the effectiveness 
of the system in place at BMW AG in complying with the regulatory requirements of the 
 European Market Infrastructure Regulation. 
The Audit Committee concurred with the decision of the Board of Management to raise 
the Company’s share capital in accordance with Article 4 (5) of the Articles of Incorporation 
(Authorised Capital 2019) by € 1,439,975 and issue a corresponding number of new non- 
voting bearer shares of preferred stock in conjunction with the Employee Share Programme.
Within its role as a preparatory body, in its four meetings the Personnel Committee focused 
on the remuneration of, and succession planning for, the Board of Management. The ap-
propriateness of Board of Management remuneration for the financial years 2021 and 2022 
was reviewed, including rigorous scrutiny of the determination of the corporate earnings 
and performance factors applicable for Board of Management remuneration during those 
two years. In addition, the Personnel Committee deliberated on targets for the financial 
year 2023. Apart from these matters, it prepared one reappointment and one new appoint-
ment. The committee also adopted a resolution to approve loans granted by and trans-
actions concluded by BMW Bank with members of the representative bodies of BMW AG, 
and prepared for a change in the BMW Group’s external remuneration consultant.
The Nomination Committee convened once during the financial year 2022. Taking into ac-
count the German Corporate Governance Code and the composition requirements resolved 
by the Supervisory Board, the Nomination Committee discussed the composition of the 
Supervisory Board regarding shareholder representatives and issued a recommendation 
regarding the Supervisory Board’s election proposal to the 2023 Annual General Meeting. 
The Mediation Committee, which is prescribed by law, did not need to convene during the 
financial year 2022.
Composition of the Board of Management 
The composition of the Board of Management did not change during the financial year 2022. 
However, the Supervisory Board resolved to extend the term of office of one member.
Composition of the Supervisory Board, the Presiding Board and the Supervisory 
Board’s committees 
There were no changes to the composition of the Supervisory Board during the financial 
year 2022 on the shareholder representative side. The Annual General Meeting elected 
Dr Heinrich Hiesinger to the Supervisory Board for a further term of office of approximately 
four years.
With regard to the employee representatives, Mr Werner Zierer retired from the Supervisory 
Board with effect from 31 March 2022 as well as Dr Thomas Wittig (as representative of 
the executive employees) with effect from 31 May 2022, in each case due to retirement. We 
wish to thank both gentlemen for their outstanding cooperation. We would also like to 
thank Mr Zierer for his dedicated work over a period of more than 20 years, and Dr Wittig 
for his knowledgeable support as an expert in the field of finance. André Mandl, Chairman 
of the Works Council of the Regensburg plant, was appointed as successor to Mr Zierer and 
Mr Gerhard Kurz, Head of Purchasing, Quality Management Drive at BMW AG, was ap-
pointed as successor for Dr Wittig, each for the remaining term of office and by court order. 
In addition, at the end of 2022, the long-serving First Deputy Chairman of our Supervisory 
Board and Chairman of the General Works Council of BMW AG, Mr Manfred Schoch, 
stepped down from the Supervisory Board to enjoy his well-earned retirement. Mr Schoch 
had been a member of the Supervisory Board since 1988 and, over this long period of 
time, had a decisive influence on the work of the Supervisory Board thanks to his entrepre-
neurial far-sightedness, professional competence and overall commitment to championing 
the best interests of the BMW Group and its employees. We wish to give Manfred Schoch a 
special vote of thanks for his life’s work.
In September 2022, the Audit Committee was enlarged following the election of Rachel 
Empey and Dr Dominique Mohabeer, thereby improving the Committee’s level of financial 
expertise and diversity as well as the Committee’s independence. An overview of the 
 composition of the Super visory Board and its committees is provided in the Statement of 
Corporate Governance which is available on our website together with the curricula vitae 
of Supervisory Board members.

Examination of financial statements and the profit distribution proposal
PwC was appointed as external auditor for the financial year 2022. PwC initially conducted 
a review of the condensed Interim Group Financial Statements and the Interim Group Man-
agement Report for the first half of 2022 and presented its findings to the Audit Committee. 
No issues were identified that might indicate that the condensed Interim Group Financial 
Statements and Interim Group Management Report had not been prepared in accordance 
with the applicable provisions in all material respects.
The Company Financial Statements and the Group Financial Statements of BMW AG for 
the financial year 2022, including the Combined Management Report, on which PwC has 
issued unqualified audit opinions, were authorised by the Board of Management on 
7 March 2023. These audit opinions were signed for the fourth consecutive financial year 
by Petra Justenhoven as independent auditor (Wirtschaftsprüferin) and, for the first time, 
by Michael Popp (Wirtschaftsprüfer) as the auditor responsible for the performance of the 
engagement. 
At its meeting held on 1 March 2023, the Audit Committee initially gave in-depth considera-
tion to the preliminary version of the Company and Group Financial Statements and the 
Combined Management Report (including the combined Non-financial (Group) Statement 
and the information on EU Taxonomy) as well as the draft version of the auditor’s long-
form reports. 
Immediately after authorising their issue, the Board of Management submitted the Company 
and Group Financial Statements for the financial year 2022 and the Combined Manage-
ment Report (including the Combined Non-financial (Group) Statement) to the Supervisory 
Board. The auditor’s long-form audit reports were also submitted to the Supervisory 
Board in a prompt manner. In order to facilitate preparations, drafts of these documents 
had already been made available to the Supervisory Board in advance.
At its meeting held on 8 March 2023, the Audit Committee diligently examined and deliber-
ated on these documents before they were considered in detail at the plenary session of 
the Supervisory Board on 9 March 2023. 
At the two respective meetings, the Board of Management provided a detailed explanation 
of the reporting documents to the Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board. The repre-
sentatives of the external auditor reported on the main findings of their audit and answered 
questions put to them by members of the Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board,

 partially without the members of the Board of Management being present. Both the 
 Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board gave meticulous consideration to the key 
audit  matters and the related audit procedures. 
The representatives of the external auditors confirmed that the risk management system 
established by the Board of Management is capable of identifying any developments that 
might threaten the Company’s going-concern status at an early stage. They also confirmed 
that no material weaknesses in the internal control system and risk management system 
were identified with regard to the financial reporting process. In the course of their audit 
work, they did not identify any facts inconsistent with the contents of the Declaration of 
Compliance pursuant to § 161 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) jointly issued by 
the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board.
Based on a thorough examination conducted by the Audit Committee and the Supervisory 
Board, we concurred with the results of the external audit. In accordance with the final 
 result of this examination, no objections were raised. At our meeting held on 9 March 2023, 
we accordingly approved the Group and Company Financial Statements of BMW AG for 
the financial year 2022. The Company Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 
2022 have therefore been adopted.
Furthermore, in both the Audit Committee and the full Supervisory Board, we examined 
the Board of Management’s proposal to use the unappropriated profit to pay a dividend of 
€ 8.50 for each share of common stock entitled to receive a dividend and € 8.52 for each 
share of preferred stock entitled to receive a dividend and to transfer the remaining amount 
to other revenue reserves. We consider the proposal appropriate and have therefore 
 approved it.
Based on the preparatory work of the Audit Committee, the Supervisory Board and the 
Board of Management jointly prepared the Remuneration Report for the financial year 
2022 in accordance with § 162 AktG. At the request of the Audit Committee, PwC reviewed 
the contents of the Remuneration Report, reported to both the Audit Committee and the 
Supervisory Board on the results of the review, and confirmed that the Remuneration Report 
complies with the financial reporting provisions contained in § 162 AktG in all material 
 respects. 
The Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board also carefully examined the combined 
Non-financial (Group) Statement for the year ended 31 December 2022. Following an in-
depth explanation of the statement by the Board of Management, representatives of PwC 
presented the key findings of their audit and answered additional questions posed by the 
members of the Supervisory Board. Based on the “limited assurance” audit performed by 
PwC on those parts of the Management Report and certain sustainability disclosures in 
the BMW Group Report 2022 that were not subject to a reasonable assurance engagement, 
PWC issued an unqualified opinion, signed for the first time by Michael Popp (Wirtschafts-
prüfer) and for the second time by Nicolette Behncke (Wirtschaftsprüferin). The Supervisory 
Board acknowledged and approved the combined Non-financial (Group) Statement drawn 
up by the Board of Management. Following a preparatory review conducted by the Presiding 
Board as well as a further review at Supervisory Board level, the Statement on Corporate 
Governance drawn up by the Board of Management was also approved by the Supervisory 
Board.
Expression of appreciation by the Supervisory Board 
In a year again marked by a set of particularly challenging circumstances, the Board of 
Management and the entire workforce can be proud of their achievements, which have 
helped take the BMW Group further along its path of automotive transformation. We there-
fore wish to express our deep thanks and appreciation to the members of the Board of 
Management and every single employee of the BMW  Group worldwide. 
We are confident that the Board of Management and the BMW Group’s workforce – moti-
vated by their determination to perform at an outstanding level and in a true spirit of 
 innovation – will continue to help extend the BMW Group’s competitive lead in the field of 
sustainable and digital mobility.

LAD I ES  AND G ENTL EMEN:
At the BMW Group – we move body, heart and mind.
Last year, I introduced you to our “North Star” – which defines our identity 
and our direction, and answers the question: “Why do we exist as a 
 company?” We move body, heart and mind. This idea also  encapsulates 
our impact on society as a value-based, value-creating company. We 
 deliver on our promises. You can continue to expect this from your Com-
pany in the future. It is what makes us special. In the first part of my 
statement, I will explain our mission through five hypotheses. In part two, 
I will show how your Company is setting itself up for the future and what 
our plans are.
This is, of course, a priority for you, since you want the BMW Group to 
 remain an attractive and future-oriented investment.
Oliver Zipse
Chairman of the Board  
of Management
