Dear shareholders, customers, partners and employees:  
Thank you for your support and investment in Microsoft. We’re proud of our progress this year, and we are eager to make 
even more progress in the year ahead.  
We continue to be guided by our mission to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve 
more. The breadth and depth of our mission unlocks unprecedented opportunity as technology transforms every industry 
and has the power to make a difference in the lives of everyone. We strive to create local opportunity, growth and impact in 
every community and country around the world. Our platforms and tools enable creativity in all of us, and help drive small-
business productivity, large business competitiveness and public-sector efficiency. They also support new startups, improve 
educational and health outcomes, and empower human ingenuity. Our sense of purpose lies in our customers’ success.  
Now let me share more about what we delivered in fiscal 2017 for our shareholders, our customers and partners, and for 
the communities in which we operate throughout the world.  
PROGRESS AND OUR RESULTS  
We delivered $90.0 billion in revenue and $22.3 billion in operating income this past fiscal year. Adjusting for Windows 10 
revenue deferrals and restructuring expenses, revenue was $96.7 billion with $29.3 billion in operating income.  
We continued to invest in innovation and expand our market opportunities, while maintaining our commitment to shareholder 
return, which included total cash return of $22.3 billion this year.  
Our commercial cloud annualized revenue run rate ended the year exceeding $18.9 billion, up more than 56 percent year-
over-year. Our cloud growth puts us squarely on track to reach the goal we set a little over two years ago of $20 billion in 
commercial cloud annualized revenue run rate in fiscal 2018.  
The strength of our results across our reporting segments reflects our accelerating innovation as well as increased customer 
usage and engagement across our businesses.  
•  More than 100 million people use Office 365 commercial.  
•  More than 27 million consumers use Office 365 Home & Personal across devices.  
•  More than 53 million members are active on Xbox Live.  
•  More than 500 million LinkedIn members use the LinkedIn network.  
•  Windows 10 is active on more than 500 million devices around the world.  
•  Dynamics 365 customers grew more than 40 percent year-over-year.  
•  Azure compute usage more than doubled year-over-year.  
We prioritized our investments to capture our expanding market opportunities. We are investing for the future with product 
innovation complemented by new acquisitions and partnerships. We have completed our acquisition of LinkedIn to connect 
the world’s largest professional  network with the world’s leading  professional cloud. We are investing to create  broader 
economic benefit and opportunity with our datacenter expansion, bringing Azure to 42 regions globally  – more than any 
other cloud provider – and with the most comprehensive compliance coverage in the industry.  
We  broadened  our  offerings  to  reach  new  audiences,  such  as  bringing  Office  365  to  firstline  workers  from  retail  and 
hospitality to manufacturing. We took collaboration to a new level with Microsoft Teams, which brings people, conversations 
and content together in a digital hub. We are in the forefront of innovating in mixed reality and how this new medium can 
radically change gaming, firstline and knowledge work through immersive experiences. We are innovating in gaming with 
new services such as Mixer and Xbox Game Pass. We introduced hundreds of new Azure  
1 
  

--- Page 3 ---
services, including new cognitive services APIs for vision, speech, text, translation, emotion and more. We have galvanized 
the company’s efforts around AI both to power each of our product categories with breakthrough capabilities and make the 
same capabilities available to our customers through Azure. We inspired new ways for students and teachers to create and 
learn with Windows 10 S. And we continued to create new device categories with Windows 10 and Surface, including the 
new Surface Studio and Laptop.  
And  we’re  continually  transforming  to  better  serve  customers,  evolving  our  sales  and  marketing  approach  to  galvanize 
around five core customer solution areas.  
Across every industry in every corner of the world, our customers are using Microsoft technologies to radically transform 
everything from agriculture to manufacturing, and we are only at the beginning. Here are some examples.  
BOEING  
Boeing is using Microsoft HoloLens for 3-D visualization to transform employee training, and it is using Cortana Intelligence, 
Azure  and  Azure  IoT  to  harness  a  wealth  of  aircraft  data.  This  “digital  twin”  aircraft  increases  crew  and  maintenance 
efficiency, improves customer experience, and creates a new business model and services that Boeing can offer its airline 
customers.  
THYSSENKRUPP  
thyssenkrupp Elevator is using HoloLens to transform the way it measures, visualizes and installs its products, streamlining 
the initial surveying process of a stair lift installation. Using spatial mapping, 3-D visualization and the natural inputs offered 
by mixed reality, the company has digitized its sales and manufacturing processes to reduce delivery times as much as 4x, 
transforming its customer experience and growing its business opportunity.  
TETRA PAK  
Tetra Pak, the world’s largest food packaging company and inventor of the 20th century’s most important innovation in that 
industry, aseptic packaging technology, employs Azure to enable  its cloud-connected machines to  predict  exactly when 
equipment  needs maintenance. Service engineers  use  HoloLens to access experts who remotely guide them through a 
repair, reducing time and cost. With the cloud and mixed reality, Tetra Pak is delivering new and existing value in a much 
more efficient way – in the most remote locations, on the most mobile devices.  
LAND O’ LAKES  
Land O’ Lakes is working to feed the world sustainably by embracing the Microsoft Cloud, predictive data analytics and 
mobile technologies in tandem with family farmers. Using Azure, Office 365 and Surface, farmers in different parts of the 
world can access agronomic research, weather information and satellite data to make the right planting decisions and react 
to real-time changes in the field, every day.  
SCHNEIDER ELECTRIC  
Responsible and sustainable management of fresh water is one of the world’s biggest challenges. With 70 percent of fresh 
water reserves being used for agricultural purposes, every drop counts. Schneider Electric has built a smart farming platform 
using Azure IoT to enable farmers to more efficiently manage water use. Advanced analytics, live local data from sensors 
on the farm and access to pricing information from the local water utility allow farmers to maximize crop and livestock yields 
and lower energy consumption by pumping water at optimal times.  
CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY AND CLEVELAND CLINIC  
Case  Western  Reserve  University  and  Cleveland  Clinic  are  using  mixed  reality  to  transform  medical  education.  Using 
HoloLens, they built an entirely new and immersive way to teach and learn human anatomy. Doctors who have  
2 
 

--- Page 4 ---
looked at data sets like this for years say they have never fully understood the 3-D structure until seeing it as a hologram 
with HoloLens, giving them the ability to see a brain tumor in mixed reality and predict the impact of the tumor with 3-D 
modeling, or seeing the aortic valve in true relation to the critical structures around it.  
LOOKING FORWARD: OUR EXPANSIVE OPPORTUNITY  
A new technology paradigm  
As you can begin to see in the examples above, a new technology paradigm is emerging, one with an intelligent cloud and 
an intelligent edge. Microsoft will lead this new era. There are three characteristics that define this shift. The first is that the 
experience layer is becoming multidevice and multisense, where a person’s experience with technology will span a multitude 
of devices and become increasingly more natural and multisensory with voice, ink, gestures and gaze interactions. Second, 
artificial intelligence (AI) will be pervasive across devices, apps and infrastructure to drive insights and act on your behalf. 
Third, computing will be more distributed than ever before with compute power at the edge, whether it’s the connected car, 
the connected factory floor or any connected device. As developers write new applications for this paradigm, they need new 
mechanisms to manage the complexity of distributed, event-driven computing.  
With this  new paradigm comes  new opportunity. Every  customer  is  looking for both  innovative technology to drive  new 
growth and a strategic partner that can help them build their own digital capability. Customers are looking to change how 
they  use  digital  technology  and  to  reimagine  how  they  empower  their  employees,  engage  customers,  optimize  their 
operations,  and  change  the  very  core  of  their  products  and  services.  They  are  building  their  own  digital  systems  of 
intelligence to drive growth. Microsoft is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this opportunity with the combination of our 
technology, partner ecosystem and culture of growth mindset.  
As we look ahead to fiscal 2018 and beyond, we will focus on bringing our technology and products together into experiences 
and solutions that deliver new value for our customers. Going forward, we will focus our innovation and investments in areas 
where we see the greatest opportunity for growth.  
The modern workplace  
The  workplace  itself  is  transforming  –  from  changing  employee  expectations,  a  widening  skills  gap,  more  diverse  and 
globally distributed teams, to an increasingly complex threat environment. The productivity experiences and tools we deliver 
will unlock the creator in all of us and enable seamless teamwork not just in the workplace, but also at school and at home 
across all the devices people use – from the phone to the laptop to mixed-reality headsets to the whiteboard. Microsoft 365 
– which brings together Windows 10, Office 365 and Enterprise Mobility & Security – will be a key driver of value for our 
business customers of all sizes and for our business growth. The Microsoft Graph, which provides the underlying data model 
of the user’s experience, and the LinkedIn network, will make it possible for every professional in any business or functional 
role to be much more productive in getting things done.  
Business applications  
Every  process  inside  a  business  is  being  digitized.  This  rapid  shift  means  customers  are  looking  to  move  away  from 
monolithic suites that perpetuate disconnected data siloes and expensive custom extensibility frameworks. Our approach 
with Dynamics 365 and LinkedIn is to build modular business applications that are part of a connected data graph, enabling 
AI and extensibility that  span a customer’s business process  needs. We will enable organizations  of all sizes to digitize 
business-critical  functions  across  relationship  sales,  talent  and  people  processes,  operations,  customer  service, field 
service, and more.  
Applications and infrastructure  
Cloud computing  is foundational to enabling  digital transformation for  any  organization. Beyond being  a trusted,  global, 
hyper-scale cloud, what makes Azure unique is our hybrid consistency, developer productivity and SaaS  
3 

--- Page 5 ---
application  integration.  Our  hybrid  infrastructure  consistency  spans  identity,  data,  compute,  management  and  security, 
helping  to  support  the  real-world  needs  and  evolving  regulatory  requirements  of  commercial  customers  and  enterprise-
focused SaaS  ISVs. Azure Stack is an extension of Azure that enables developers to build and deploy applications the 
same  way  whether  they  run  on  the  intelligent  cloud  or  the  intelligent  edge.  With  Visual  Studio  and  Azure  Services,  we 
provide the toolchain and application platform for modern DevOps that helps organizations with their agility and productivity 
– and enable them to use the best of the Windows ecosystem and the best of the Linux ecosystem together. Azure enables 
SaaS ISV developers to reach 100 million plus enterprise users through the integration of Azure Active Directory and Office 
365, and by embedding Power BI, Power Apps and Flow as part of their applications, enables customers to have consistent 
identity, developer extensibility and security across their application portfolio  spanning their own custom applications and 
SaaS applications.  
Data and AI  
The core currency of any business going forward will be the ability to reason over its data  using AI to drive competitive 
advantage.  Microsoft  Research  continues  to  make  significant  advances  in  AI  technologies,  infusing  them  into  product 
experiences  like  Bing,  Cortana,  LinkedIn  Newsfeed,  Skype  Translator,  Editor  and  PowerPoint  Designer  in  Office, 
Relationship  Health  in  Dynamics,  HoloLens,  and  many  more. We  are  uniquely  positioned  to  take  this  AI  capability  and 
democratize it, so that every developer can be an AI developer, and every company can become an AI company. It all starts 
with having support for the comprehensive data estate spanning Azure Database, Cosmos DB, Data Warehouse and Data 
Lake, combined with SQL Server. Azure is the cloud with the richest set of ML tools, bot framework and cognitive services, 
enabling developers to add AI capabilities into their applications. With state-of-the-art GPU and FPGA support, our Azure 
infrastructure is best in class for AI workloads. I am excited about our road map here and what’s to come.  
Gaming  
The  $100 billion  plus  gaming  industry  is  experiencing  massive  growth  and  transformation,  and  we  have  an  expansive 
opportunity as we think about gaming end-to-end – from the way games are created and distributed to how they are played 
and viewed. We will build on our strong foundation of connected gaming assets across PC, console, mobile and work to 
grow  and  engage  the  53 million  strong  Xbox  Live  member  network  more  deeply  and  frequently –  from  great  game 
experiences to streaming to social to mixed reality. We will be the company for gamers to play the games they want, with 
the people they want, on the devices they want.  I’m excited about our opportunity to accelerate our growth opportunity, 
innovate boldly and earn new fans.  
While these solution areas capture our near-term opportunity, we’re also investing in cutting-edge research to lead well into 
the future. Artificial intelligence, mixed reality and quantum computing will come together and shape the future of our industry 
and others for generations to come. We’re deeply committed to leading in these areas and bringing them together in ways 
that  enable  humanity  to  solve  our  most  pressing  issues,  from  climate  change  to  curing  cancer  to  creating  economic 
opportunity for all. We will do so by adhering to the highest ethical principles and standing for our timeless values.  
OUR RESPONSIBILITY IN THE WORLD  
Our mission to empower every person and every organization on the planet extends to our corporate social responsibility 
efforts. We strive to use our technology, grants, employees and voice to improve people’s lives by enabling access to the 
benefits and opportunities that technology offers. This past year we increased our investments across a range of strategic 
initiatives.  
•  Microsoft Philanthropies donated more than $1.2 billion in software and services in fiscal 2017, helping nonprofits 
around the world get the technology and skills they need for today’s digital economy.  
•  Since 2016 we have donated more than $1 billion in cloud services to more than 90,000 nonprofits and university 
researchers – achieving our $1 billion milestone a year early – and announced a new plan to more than triple the 
number of nonprofits we’ll reach to 300,000 over the next three years.

•  Our employees raised a record-breaking $142 million through our employee giving program in 2016. I am proud 
and humbled by their commitment to not only make a difference with our customers and partners, but in their local 
communities and the broader world.  
•  We’re ensuring that our products and services are accessible to meet the needs of all our customers, including 
the more than 1 billion people around the world with disabilities. Examples include our new Eye Control feature in 
Windows 10 for people with ALS, and Seeing AI, a free app on iOS for blind and low vision users that narrates the 
world around you.  
•  We’re  partnering  with  telecommunications  companies  through  our  Rural  Airband  Initiative  to  bring  broadband 
connectivity to 2 million people in rural America by 2022, helping to close the rural broadband gap for the more 
than 20 million Americans living in rural communities who lack access to the economic, educational  and health 
opportunities the internet provides.  
•  We’re advancing our  sustainability efforts, completing our largest wind energy purchase to date and  aiming to 
address some of the world’s toughest environment challenges through our new AI for Earth initiative.  
•  Finally,  as  part  of  our  broader  responsibility  to  engage  thoughtfully  in  the  public  dialogue  on  the  important 
challenges facing our world, we published “A Cloud for Global Good” to help companies and governments ensure 
technology is trusted, responsible and inclusive.  
When I reflect on the past year, I’m proud of our progress – both in our own continued transformation and in how we are 
empowering customers to digitally transform.  
As a multinational corporation, we have both a substantial opportunity and a high responsibility to ensure that technology’s 
benefits  reach  people  more  broadly  across  our  global  society  and  economy.  Everywhere  we  operate,  we  focus  on 
contributing to local communities in positive ways – helping to spark growth, competitiveness and economic opportunity for 
all.  
To serve the needs of our customers well into the future, we must continually transform while remaining steadfast to our 
timeless values. Microsoft has both the capability and the culture to help customers digitally transform today, while creating 
new technologies that are among the most innovative and impactful humankind has ever experienced with mixed  reality, 
artificial intelligence and quantum computing.  
We will continue to invest in the highest growth opportunities, innovate boldly, and empower people and organizations by 
creating the platforms and tools that enable others to grow and thrive, now and well into the future.
