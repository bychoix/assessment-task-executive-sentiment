Dear Fellow Shareholders,
Jamie Dimon,  
Chairman and  
Chief Executive Officer
Last year — in fact, the last decade — was an extraordinary time for our company. We 
managed through the financial crisis and its turbulent aftermath while never losing 
sight of the reason we are here: to serve our clients, our communities and countries 
across the globe and, of course, to earn a fair profit for our shareholders. All the 
while, we have been successfully executing our control and regulatory agenda and 
continuing to invest in technology, infrastructure and talent — critical to the future of 
the company. And each year, our company has been getting safer and stronger. We 
continue to see exciting opportunities to invest for the future and to do more for our 
clients and our communities — as well as continue to support the growth of economies 
around the world. 
I feel enormously blessed to work for this great company and with such talented 
employees. Our management team and employees have built an exceptional 
organization that is one of the most trusted and respected financial institutions in the 
world. It has been their dedication, fortitude and perseverance that made this possible. 
And it fills me with tremendous pride.

Our company earned a record $24.4 billion in net income on revenue of $96.6 billion 
in 2015. In fact, we have delivered record results in the last five out of six years, and 
we hope to continue to deliver in the future. Our financial results reflected strong 
underlying performance across our businesses, and, importantly, we exceeded all our 
major financial commitments — balance sheet optimization, capital deployment, global 
systemically important bank (GSIB) surcharge reduction and expense cuts.

 Net income        Diluted earnings per share        Return on tangible common equity
While we did produce record profits last year, our returns on tangible common equity  
have been coming down, mostly due to higher capital requirements, higher control  
costs and low interest rates. Our return on tangible common equity was 13% last 
year, though we still believe that we will be able to achieve, over time, returns of 
approximately 15%. We still don’t know the final capital rules, which could have 
additional negative effects, but we do believe that the capital requirements eventually 
will be offset by optimizing our use of capital and other precious resources, by realizing 
market share gains due to some competitors leaving certain businesses, and by 
implementing extensive cost efficiencies created by streamlining and digitizing our 
processes. I will discuss some of these efforts later on in this letter.

Tangible book value over time captures the company’s use of capital, balance sheet and profitability. In this chart, we are looking at 
heritage Bank One shareholders and JPMorgan Chase & Co. shareholders. The chart shows the increase in tangible book value per share; 
it is an aftertax number assuming all dividends were retained vs. the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (S&P 500), which is a pre-tax number 
with dividends reinvested.
1 On March 27, 2000, Jamie Dimon was hired as CEO of Bank One.
We continued to deliver for our shareholders in 2015. The table above shows the 
growth in tangible book value per share, which we believe is a conservative measure 
of value. You can see that our tangible book value per share has grown far more than 
that of the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (S&P 500) in both time periods. For Bank 
One shareholders since March 27, 2000, the stock has performed far better than most 
financial companies and the S&P 500. We are not proud of the fact that our stock 
performance has only equaled the S&P 500 since the JPMorgan Chase & Co. merger 
with Bank One on July 1, 2004 and essentially over the last five to 10 years. On a 
relative basis, though, JPMorgan Chase stock has far outperformed the S&P Financials 
Index and, in fact, has been one of the best performers of all banks during this difficult 
period. The details are shown on the table on the following page.

Many of the legal and regulatory issues that our company and the industry have faced 
since the Great Recession have been resolved or are receding, which will allow the 
strength and quality of our underlying business to more fully shine through.
In this letter, I will discuss the issues highlighted below — which describe many of 
our successes and opportunities, as well as our challenges and responses. The main 
sections are listed below, and, unlike prior years, we have organized much of this 
letter around some of the key questions we have received from shareholders and other 
interested parties.

--- Page 8 ---
I.  Our franchises are strong — and getting stronger 
•  How do you compare your franchises with your peers? What makes you believe your 
businesses are strong? 
II.  We must and will protect our company and those we serve
•  You say you have a “fortress balance sheet.” What does that mean? Can you handle 
the extreme stress that seems to happen around the world from time to time? 
•  Have you completed your major de-risking initiatives? 
•  Do you think you now have “fortress controls” in place?
•  To protect the company and to meet standards of safety and soundness, don’t you 
have to earn a fair profit? Many banks say that the cost of all the new rules makes 
this hard to do. 
•  What is all this talk of regulatory optimization, and don’t some of these things  
hurt clients? When will you know the final rules?
•  How do you manage geopolitical and country risks?
•  How do you manage your interest rate exposure? Are you worried about negative 
interest rates and the growing differences across countries?
•  Are you worried about liquidity in the marketplace? What does it mean for  
JPMorgan Chase, its clients and the broader economy?
•  Why are you making such a big deal about protecting customers’ data in your bank? 
III.  We actively develop and support our employees
•  How are you ensuring you have the right conduct and culture?
•  How are you doing in your diversity efforts?
•  With all the new rules, committees and centralization, how can you fight bureaucracy 
and complacency and keep morale high?
•  How are you doing retaining key people?

IV.  We are here to serve our clients
•  How do you view innovation, technology and FinTech? And have 
banks been good innovators? Do you have economies of scale, and 
how are they benefiting your clients?
•  How do you intend to win in payments, particularly with so many 
strong competitors — many from Silicon Valley? 
•  You always seem to be segmenting your businesses — how and why 
are you doing this?
•  How and why do you use big data?
•  Why are you investing in sales and trading, as well as in your 
Investment Bank, when others seem to be cutting back?
•  Why are you still in the mortgage business? 
V.  We have always supported our communities
•  You seem to be doing more and more to support your communities 
— how and why? 
VI.  A safe, strong banking industry is absolutely critical to a country’s 
success — banks’ roles have changed, but they will never be a utility
•  Does the United States really need large banks?
•  Why do you say that banks need to be steadfast and always there for 
their clients — doesn’t that always put you in the middle of the storm?
•  Will banks ever regain a position of trust? How will this be done?
•  Are you and your regulators thinking more comprehensively and 
in a forward-looking way to play a role in helping to accelerate 
global growth?

I. OUR F RANCHI SES ARE  STR ON G —  A ND   GE T TI NG 
STRONGER
When I travel around the world, and we do 
business in over 100 countries, our clients – 
who are big companies to small businesses, 
investors and individuals, as well as coun-
tries and their sovereign institutions – are 
almost uniformly pleased with us. In fact, 
most cities, states and countries want more 
of JPMorgan Chase. They want us to bring 
more of our resources – our financial capa-
bilities and technology, as well as our human 
capital and expertise – to their communities. 
While we do not know what the next few 
years may bring, we are confident that the 
needs of our clients around the world will 
continue to grow and that our consistent 
strategy of building for the future and being 
there for our clients in good times and bad 
has put us in very good stead. Whatever the 
future brings, we will face it from a position 
of strength and stability.
Because our business leaders do such a 
good job describing their businesses (and 
I strongly urge you to read their letters on 
pages 52–72 in this Annual Report), it is 
unnecessary for me to cover each in detail 
here, other than to answer the following 
critical questions.

1  Excludes legal expense.
2  Best-in-class overhead ratio represents implied expenses of comparable peer segments weighted by JPMorgan Chase (JPM) revenue: Wells Fargo 
Community Banking (WFC), Citi Institutional Clients Group (Citi), PNC Corporate and Institutional Banking (PNC), UBS Wealth Management and  
Wealth Management Americas (UBS WM) and BlackRock (BLK). JPM overhead ratio represents the sum of the implied expenses of all peers and  
JPM Corporate segment divided by JPM revenue.

by Corporate.

tangible common equity: WFC, Citi Institutional Clients Group (Citi), Fifth Third Bank (FITB), Bank of America Global Wealth and Investment Manage-
ment (BAC), T. Rowe Price (TROW). JPM ROTCE represents the sum of the implied combined NIAC of all peers and JPM Corporate segment divided by 
JPM average tangible equity.

How do you compare your franchises with your peers? What makes you believe your businesses 
are strong?
Virtually all of our businesses are close to 
best in class, in overhead ratios and, more 
important, in return on equity (ROE), as 
shown on the chart on page 8. Of even more 
relevance, we have these strong ratios while 
making sizable investments for the future 
(which we have reported on extensively in 
the past and you can read more about in the 
CEO letters). It is easy to meet short-term 
targets by skimping on investments for 
the future, but that is not our approach for 
building the business for the long term. 
We are deeply aware that our clients 
choose who they want to do business with 
each and every day, and we are gratified 
that we continue to earn our clients’ busi-
ness and their trust. If you are gaining 
customers and market share, you have to 
be doing something right. The chart below 
shows that we have been meeting this goal 
fairly consistently for 10 years.

Good businesses also deeply care about 
improving customer satisfaction. As shown 
above, you can see that our Chase customer 
satisfaction score continues to rise. In 
addition, our Commercial Banking satis-
faction score is among the highest in the 
industry in terms of customer loyalty. In 
Asset Management, where customers vote 
with their wallet, JPMorgan Funds finished 
second in long-term net flows among all 
fund complexes. 
Later on in this letter, I will describe our 
fortress balance sheet and controls, as 
well as the discipline we have around risk 
management. I will also talk more about 
our employees, some exciting new oppor-
tunities – mostly driven by innovative 
technologies – and our ongoing support 
for our communities and our country. It is 
critical that we do all of these things right 
to maintain the strength of our company.

II. WE MUST AN D WILL  PROTEC T OUR   CO MPA N Y   A N D 
THOSE WE S ERV E
In support of our main mission – to serve 
our clients and our communities – there 
is nothing more important than to protect 
our company so that we are strong and can 
continue to be here for all of those who 
count on us. We have taken many actions 
that should give our shareholders, clients and 
regulators comfort and demonstrate that our 
company is rock solid.
The actions we have taken to strengthen  
our company.
In this section, we describe the many 
actions that we have taken to make our 
company stronger and safer: our fortress 
balance sheet with enhanced capital and 
liquidity, our ability to survive extreme 
stress of multiple types, our extensive 
de-risking and simplification of the busi-
ness, and the building of fortress controls in 
meeting far more stringent regulatory stan-
dards. Taken together, these actions have 
enabled us to make extraordinary progress 
toward reducing and ultimately eliminating 
the risk of JPMorgan Chase failing and  
the cost of any failure being borne by the  
American taxpayer or the U.S. economy. 
You say you have a “fortress balance sheet.” What does that mean? Can you handle the 
extreme stress that seems to happen around the world from time to time?
Nearly every year since the Great Recession, 
we have improved virtually every measure of 
financial strength, including many new ones. 
It’s important to note as a starting point that 
in the worst years of 2008 and 2009, JPMorgan 
Chase did absolutely fine – we never lost 
money, we continued to serve our clients, 
and we had the wherewithal and capability 
to buy and integrate Bear Stearns and 
Washington Mutual. That said, we none-
theless recognize that many Americans did 
not do fine, and the financial crisis exposed 
weaknesses in the mortgage market and 
other areas. Later in this letter, I will also 
describe what we are doing to strengthen 
JPMorgan Chase and to help support the 
entire economy. 
The chart on page 12 shows many of the 
measures of our financial strength – both 
from the year preceding the crisis and our 
improvement in the last year alone. 
In addition, every year, the Federal Reserve puts 
all large banks through a very severe and very 
detailed stress test.
Among other things, last year’s stress test 
assumed that unemployment would go to 
10.1%, housing prices would fall 25%, equity 
markets would decline by nearly 60%, real 
gross domestic product (GDP) would decline 
4.6%, credit spreads would widen dramati-
cally and oil prices would rise to $110 per 
barrel. The stress test also assumed an instan-
taneous global market shock, effectively far 
worse than the one that happened in 2009, 
causing large trading losses. It also assumed 
the failure of the largest counterparty (this 
is meant to capture the failure of the global 
bank that you have the most extensive deriva-
tive relationship with; e.g., a Lehman-type 
event), which would cause additional losses. 
The stress test assumed that banks would not 
stop buying back stock – therefore depleting 
their capital – and would continue to grow 
dramatically. (Of course, growing dramati-
cally and buying back stock if your bank were 
under stress would be irresponsible – and is 
something we would never do.) Under this 
assumed stress, the Federal Reserve esti-
mates that JPMorgan Chase would lose

*  Footnote: Our Chief Operating 
Officer Matt Zames talks in his 
letter on pages 52–55 about 
many important initiatives to 
protect our company, including 
our physical security and 
cybersecurity, so I will not 
duplicate any of that information.
