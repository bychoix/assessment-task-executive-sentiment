2013 MARkED Bl ACkROCk’S 25 TH  AnnIvERSARy.  
WE FOUnDED OUR COMPAny In 1988 On OnE CORE COMMITMEnT:

Over our first 25 years, we have worked 
hard to stay ahead of changing markets 
and the ever-evolving needs of our clients, 
while always embracing the highest 
ethical standards. Our fundamental 
principles have guided this approach.
As we focus on the next quarter century, 
BlackRock’s Global Executive Committee 
has incorporated these principles into  
a pledge to all of our stakeholders —  
and to ourselves — that reaffirms our 
commitment to helping our clients  
build better financial futures. Working 
together, we pledge to:
•	 	perform to the highest ethical, 
investment and operational standards
•	 	understand our clients’ real-world 
needs and build solutions to meet them 
•	 	lead by harnessing our collective 
intelligence and global reach
•	 	advocate as a responsible voice  
and valued source of information 
for investors
•	 	evolve to stay ahead of change and 
deliver for clients, shareholders 
and employees
In this annual report, we highlight how 
BlackRock fulfilled this pledge in 2013 —  
and how we will redouble our efforts to 
do so in the years to come. 
p olIcy D RIvInG MaRket S
Despite global political volatility, uneven 
economic recovery and uncertainty over 
monetary policy, the S&P 500 Index rose 
30% in 2013, its largest annual advance 
since 1997. Equities in developed regions 
outpaced those in emerging markets  
as well as commodities at a historic rate, 
while the end of a three-decade bull 
market in bonds produced losses in 
long-duration fixed income. This market 
behavior highlighted the importance  
not only of being invested, but also of 
taking a balanced approach.
A core belief at BlackRock is that  
patient, long-term investing is the best 
path to financial success, and 2013  
again confirmed the risk to investors of 
remaining on the sidelines. Those who 
steadfastly invested in a diversified 
portfolio were rewarded. Those who were 
indecisive or tried to time the market 
missed another opportunity to improve 
their financial position. 
We remain believers in global equity 
markets. Developed markets continue 
their recovery and, while emerging market 
performance has lagged materially, 
those economies retain their role as 
substantial long-term drivers of growth. 
yet market performance remains 
stubbornly tied to political outcomes.  
In recent years, central bank policy in  
the United States, Europe and Japan  
has been a dominant factor in generating 
asset appreciation and aiding global 
economic recovery. Today, the impact  
of monetary policy tools on economic 
growth is diminishing, portending greater 
volatility, given the unpredictability of

As the first months of 2014 highlighted, 
geopolitical instability remains elevated

The next stage in expanding economic 
and market growth will depend on the 
willingness and ability of governments and 
the private sector to provide leadership.  
To broaden recovery, strengthen markets 
and, in particular, tackle persistent 
unemployment, political leaders must 
look beyond monetary policy and enact 
fiscal and economic reforms that 
address the structural challenges to the 
global economy and the investment 
landscape. leadership must also involve 
changing the culture of savers worldwide 
to encourage long-term investing and 
smart, measured risk-taking in the 
markets, which creates the potential  
to generate growth and meaningful 
income over time.

people in their retire-
ment, and we have  
an obligation to be a 
strong voice in public 
debate on how govern-
ments, corporations 
and individuals can 
con front the challenges 
of longer lives. 
BlackRock will continue to respond 
forcefully as well — both within our 
business and as a responsible advocate 
for the investors we serve. Our firm today 
reflects our vision of how the investment 
environment was likely to change over 
time. now, as we build the BlackRock of 
We’re living longer — Yet Unprepared
Foremost among these global trends, 
and perhaps the defining investment 
challenge of our age, is increasing 
longevity — and the lack of preparedness 
for it. In the United States, for example, 
only 40% of Americans take part in any 
retirement plan. Savings for pre-retirees 
average just $12,000. Fewer workers 
around the world participate in defined 
benefit plans, and too many of those  
are underfunded. The fiscal costs of 
supporting an aging population continue 
to increase. 
Two-thirds of the assets that BlackRock 
manages support people in their 
retirement, and we have an obligation  
to be a strong voice in public debate on 
how governments, corporations and 
individuals can confront the challenges 
of longer lives. I believe that bold policy 
ideas must be considered, such as the 
compulsory retirement savings model 
used in Australia’s superannuation 
system. Pension funds also should 
consider a broader range of investments, 
including alternatives and nontraditional 
fixed income, to achieve the returns  
they need to meet their liabilities. 
BlackRock is investing in the tools and 
technology to inform and equip the 
current generation of savers — and the 
next. We continue to evolve our offerings 
in the growing category of target date 
funds, where we now serve more than 
eight million clients through our lifePath 
franchise. In 2013, we also introduced 
our new CoRI index tool, which gives 
pre-retirees a measure of how much 
retirement income their savings can 
provide and, in early 2014, launched five 
new funds linked to the CoRI index.

Recognizing the social, political and 
financial significance of longevity,  
we recently created a dedicated U.S. 
Retirement group to harness BlackRock’s 
best ideas and drive innovative solutions 
in this area. 
The infrastructure Opportunity
Exacerbating the longevity crisis is  
the slow pace of job creation in many 
economies. Addressing persistent 
unemployment requires a multifaceted 
response by governments and 
businesses, and one of the most 
promising opportunities is investment  
to meet the massive global need for 
infrastructure. Around the world,  
the energy revolution; the aging of  
roads, rail links, airports and other 
transportation resources; and social  
and economic development all call  
for trillions of dollars of infrastructure 
spending in the coming decades.
yet action on this front remains elusive,  
if not ambiguous. Governments simply 
cannot afford to self-fund infrastructure 
projects, demonstrating the need to 
harness the capacity of the private sector. 
Private institutional investors with low 
risk tolerances and long-term liability 
structures, such as pension funds and 
insurance companies, are ideally suited 
to put money to work in yield-oriented, 
multidecade projects that provide 
current income and can act as a natural 
inflation hedge. Attracting that investment 
requires matching institutional demand 
and capital with attractive projects in 
jurisdictions where regulatory, legal and 
political conditions are conducive to 
successful public-private partnerships. 
Countries that get it right will position 
themselves for job creation and economic 
growth and create significant competitive 
advantages for their economies. This is 
an important area for BlackRock to work 
with both policymakers and institutional 
investors to facilitate bringing the 
infrastructure opportunity to scale. 
Technology and Our Collective intelligence 
BlackRock’s business is centered on 
managing risk and delivering investment 
solutions, but I believe that today  
all companies are in the technology 
business. The pace of innovation is 
accelerating, with dramatic implications 
for markets and society. The sheer  
mass of information available and the 
speed of access to it are staggering. 
Innovation highlights the importance of 
managing legacy systems. Companies 
that do not take advantage of innovation 
can become caught up in an increasingly 
complex and risky tangle of technology. 
Winners will be those firms that are 
diligent about breaking down and 
integrating systems and establishing  
a common technology language.
The question now is which firms —  
and which societies — will seize the 
opportunity and build transformational 
business models based on technology 
innovation. BlackRock is committed to 
winning in a world reshaped by technology. 
As our company has grown, so has  
our technological leadership. We have 
leveraged that leadership to foster a 
culture of collective intelligence that 
allows us to share our best thinking  
not only with each other but also with  
our clients around the world. 
BlackRock Solutions (“BRS”), including 
our Aladdin, Financial Markets Advisory 
and Client Solutions groups, brings to 
bear a unique set of analytical tools and 
sophisticated advisory services that 
elevates the level of our interaction and 
deepens the relationships and trust we 
build with clients.
BRS is pervasive in our conversations 
with clients, helping them understand 
risk across their entire portfolios  
and develop customized, long-term 
investment strategies. It has also  
allowed us to be a valued advisor to 
institutions, governments and central 
banks confronting critical economic  
and financial challenges.

Outcome-Oriented investing
BlackRock’s analytical and risk manage-
ment capabilities are more important 
than ever in today’s investing environment. 
For decades, investors took comfort in  
a simple paradigm: when stocks go up, 
bonds go down. The financial crisis of 
2008–2009 provided ample evidence that 
correlation is the enemy of portfolio 
construction, and the post-crisis period 
has been marked by a significant rise  
in investor preference for uncorrelated, 
risk-adjusted returns. This is driving  
an increased appetite for alternative 
strategies and for uncons trained 
products that offer fund managers 
greater flexibility in delivering returns  
to shareholders. 
Solving problems and 
delivering outcomes  
is at the core of what  
we do — and has been 
since our founding. 
Outcome-oriented investing is about 
looking beyond relative performance and 
solving for future goals — how do clients 
earn enough income for retirement in  
the current interest rate environment or 
how can clients protect themselves 
against inflation concerns? BlackRock’s 
broad investment platform positions us 
to construct and deliver the investment 
outcomes our clients are searching for by 
combining active and passive offerings 
across asset classes and leveraging  
the analytical and risk management 
capabilities of BlackRock Solutions. 
Solving problems and delivering 
solutions is at the core of what we do —  
and has been since our founding. From 
helping governments and troubled 
institutions work through some of the 
most challenging issues of the financial 
crisis, to helping clients move beyond 
benchmark-driven investing to generate 
outcomes, BlackRock is and will continue 
to be a partner in building solutions. 
The shift to outcome-oriented  
strategies is driving the Global Retail 
growth opportunity, as client demand  
for packaged solutions, including liquid 
alternatives, increases. We continue  
to evolve our product set, enhance  
our distribution capabilities and build  
our global brand to better deliver 
BlackRock to our clients. 
We are also expanding the profile  
and capabilities of our leading iShares 
franchise to take advantage of the 
increasing use of ETFs to construct 
investment solutions and the secular 
shift to passive investing. Clients are 
turning to iShares to generate alpha 
through asset allocation models, as a 
liquidity tool to manage exposures,  
as a buy-and-hold investment in their 
core portfolios and to access a wide 
variety of global markets efficiently  
and transparently.

Over the years, BlackRock has not  
just responded to changing times and 
markets but anticipated them by building 
breadth and diversity into our platform. 
As we built our technology and analytics 
capabilities, we expanded our scope  
to meet client needs in a way we believe 
is unique in the industry. In 2006, we 
acquired Merrill lynch Investment 
Managers, which expanded our equity 
business overnight, forged our global 
footprint and took us into the retail 
business. Our acquisition of Barclays 
Global Investors in 2009 introduced us  
to the passive market through iShares 
ETFs and a wide range of institutional 
index offerings.

Bl ackRock, Inc. 2013 annual RepoRt
Our success in building and positioning 
our platform to take advantage of a 
changing investment ecosystem drove 
strong financial results in 2013. We 
attracted $117.1 billion in long-term net 
new flows in 2013, representing a 3.4% 
organic growth rate. We achieved a 9% 
increase in revenues to $10.2 billion, a 
13% rise in adjusted operating earnings 
and a 21% increase in adjusted earnings 
per share versus 2012. We increased our 
adjusted operating margin to 41.4%, 
demonstrating our commitment to rein-
vesting in our business for growth while 
maintaining expense discipline. Finally, 
we returned $2.2 billion to share holders 
through dividends and share repurchases 
and, in January 2014, announced a  
15% increase in our annual dividend to 
$7.72 per share.
BlackRock’s growth and consistent 
financial performance result from our 
commitment to put clients at the center 
of all we do, and understand and 
anticipate their needs. We will continue 
to invest in our business to solve for  
our clients’ investment goals, build our 
brand, enhance our product set and 
distribution capabilities and drive 
organic growth.
a Commitment to Performance
Investment performance remains  
the bottom line for investors. The shift  
to index and ETF investing reflects an 
appreciation that active managers 
seeking higher fees must offer value 
beyond replicating a benchmark. 
However, those who proclaim the end  
of active management are mistaken.  
The creation and delivery of excess 
returns plays a vital role and only those 
managers who consistently outperform 
will see strong flows in the current 
winner-take-all environment, in which 
assets flow to only a handful of top-
performing funds.
Superior investment performance has 
been a significant area of attention for 
BlackRock. Following the financial crisis, 
we reassessed and restructured much  
of our active fixed income business.  
This effort and our focus on helping our 
clients assess risk in their fixed income 
portfolios paid off amid the turmoil 
affecting those markets in 2013, when 
82% of our taxable fixed income assets 
outperformed their benchmarks or peer 
medians over the three-year period.  
Our ability to outperform across our  
fixed income platform at a time when 
others have struggled earned BlackRock 
the #1 industry ranking in U.S. Retail 
Active Fixed Income flows. We believe our 
track record will provide a meaningful 
competitive advantage in 2014. 
To enhance performance in our 
fundamental equities offerings, we 
streamlined our investment process  
and recruited top-quality managers to 
augment BlackRock’s existing talent 
base. Multiple-year track records  
will be the true measure of success,  
but early results show material 
performance improvement. 
BlackRock’s growth  
and consistent financial 
performance result 
from our commitment 
to put clients at the 
center of all we do  
and understand and 
anticipate their needs.
We are also taking advantage of our  
scale and global reach to generate 
outperformance in other ways, including 
through the BlackRock Investment 
Institute. The institute brings together 
our 1,600 portfolio managers, analysts 
and researchers to leverage our best 
thinking for clients, through robust 
dialogue on investment drivers, trends 
and opportunities.

Core to our mission is that we are a 
fiduciary to our clients. This is a 
responsibility to help build better financial 
futures not just for corporations, pension 
funds, endowments and foundations,  
but for those whose investments we 
ultimately manage — working people, 
retirees, families saving for college and 
entrepreneurs starting businesses. It is 
imperative that we not only provide the 
best investment advice and performance 
possible, but also that we take a leadership 
role to advocate on behalf of the 
constituencies we and our clients serve. 
Promoting investor-Friendly regulation 
In the face of significant changes in  
the regulatory environment, BlackRock  
is working to promote financial reform 
that increases transparency, protects 
investors and facilitates responsible 
growth of capital markets, while 
preserving consumer choice and 
maintaining a level playing field across 
industries and products. We have been 
active participants in the public debate 
on issues ranging from money market 
reform and ETF regulation to housing 
finance, market structure and liquidity. 
Many post-crisis regulatory changes 
have had a profoundly positive impact on 
the safety and soundness of the global 
financial industry. However, we must 
protect against poor policy decisions and 
unintended consequences that can take 
decades to rectify and potentially harm 
the economy, businesses and investors. 
For example, we strongly believe that, in 
the case of asset managers, regulation 
should be focused where the risk occurs — 
at the product and practice level. Asset 
managers are agents, not principals. We 
act as fiduciaries on behalf of our clients. 
We agree that additional regulation  
of products and practices may be 
necessary to promote transparency  
and stability and improve the financial 
ecosystem, but we believe the most 
effective regulatory action will focus on 
those activities that pose actual risk. 
Across the firm we will continue to take  
a leadership role in driving constructive 
change to increase the safety and 
soundness of the financial system. 
BlackRock is working  
to promote financial 
reform that increases 
transparency, protects 
investors and facilitates 
responsible growth of 
capital markets, while 
preserving consumer 
choice and maintaining 
a level playing field 
across industries and 
products.
engaging for Better Governance
BlackRock’s ownership position in 
companies across geographies and 
industries positions us to advocate for 
corporate change on behalf of our clients. 
We believe that a sound corporate 
governance framework promotes strong 
leadership by boards of directors  
and prudent management practices, 
contributes to the long-term success  
of companies and leads to better 
risk-adjusted returns for investors.  
To that end, in 2013 we engaged with 
approximately 1,400 companies on 
corporate governance, including on 
social, environmental and ethical
