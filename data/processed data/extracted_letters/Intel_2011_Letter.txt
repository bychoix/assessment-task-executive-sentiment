2011 Highlights
Letter From Your Chairman
Investor Information
2011 was an outstanding year for Intel. 
on a high-volume 14nm manufacturing facility in Arizona and 
Despite a tough macro-economic environment, 
a leading-edge development fabrication facility in Oregon.  
the company set records in platform unit sales, 
revenue, and earnings, reﬂ ecting strong global 
demand for our products and solid execution 
by our employees around the world. 
  We delivered revenue of $54.0 billion, up 24% compared to 
2010. Net income rose to $12.9 billion, up 13% from 2010, and 
earnings per share rose to $2.39, up 19% from the prior year. 
Spending as a percentage of revenue was approximately ﬂ at com-
pared to 2010, and our gross margin of 62.5% was at the top end 
of our historical gross margin range for the second year in a row. 
Continuing PC growth
In 2011, the global demand for PCs continued to surge, especially in 
emerging markets. For the ﬁ rst time, total PC purchases were higher 
in China than in any other country, followed by the U.S., Brazil, and 
Russia. Intel has beneﬁ ted from this growth, and as a result, 2011 
revenue for the PC market segment of our business increased 17% 
compared to 2010.  
  Meanwhile, the PC itself is undergoing a renaissance. Last year, 
Intel led the industry in reinventing the PC experience with the 
launch of Ultrabook™ systems, a new category of thin, responsive, 
and secure mobile devices that combine the best features of tablets 
and notebooks. The ﬁ rst Ultrabook systems, powered by 2nd 
generation Intel® Core™ processors, were introduced in 2011, and 
we expect that the industry will bring more than 80 new Ultrabook 
system designs to market in 2012. 
Data storage and high-performance computing 
Our Data Center Group develops technology for a range of applica-
tions—from cloud computing and mission-critical servers to high-
performance computing (HPC). Revenue for our Data Center Group 
topped $10.1 billion in 2011, up 17% from 2010.
  We produced our ﬁ rst teraﬂ op processor, capable of performing 
complex HPC tasks such as mapping the human genome. In addition, 
more high-volume storage and networking industries are standard-
izing on Intel® architecture, with Intel® Xeon® processors replacing 
proprietary solutions in routers, switches, and other parts of the 
communications infrastructure. 
Technology leadership
Intel continues to develop the world’s most advanced semiconductor 
Software and services
As the world’s digital footprint expands, so does its vulnerability 
to security breaches. More unique pieces of malware were 
identiﬁ ed in the last two years than existed worldwide prior to 
2010. In 2011, mobile malware increased 70% over 2010. Intel 
recognized this growing threat and the need for a new approach 
to platform security, which led to our acquisition of McAfee in 2011. 
The McAfee DeepSAFE* technology platform, introduced in 2011, 
combines McAfee’s security software with Intel’s silicon capabilities 
and is designed to detect and prevent day-zero attacks. 
Looking ahead
Our industry is at the brink of a major transformation. The number 
of connected devices in the world now tops 4 billion and continues 
to rise rapidly. Transistor usage over the past three decades will 
look ﬂ at compared to what will be needed to manage, interpret, and 
store data over the next ﬁ ve years. This creates a huge opportunity 
for Intel—and we are ready to deliver. 
For example, we now have the power envelope, volume 
economics, and technology to succeed in the smartphone market 
segment with our new Intel® Atom™ processor platform. This 
platform powers the Intel smartphone reference design that we 
introduced in early 2012. Our industry partners have responded 
enthusiastically. We have a multi-year strategic partnership with 
Motorola Mobility covering both smartphones and tablets, and a 
joint effort with Google to optimize future releases of the Android* 
platform for low-power Intel Atom processors.  
Corporate responsibility leadership
In 2011, we extended our reputation as a leading corporate citizen, 
making progress on our strategic objective to care for our people, 
care for our planet, and inspire the next generation. Last year, we 
became the ﬁ rst semiconductor company to obtain LEED* Silver 
Certiﬁ cation for an entire manufacturing campus. We helped create 
economic and social opportunities in over 100 countries through 
our education transformation efforts, and reached our goal of 
providing technology training to 10 million teachers. Intel was once 
again named one of Fortune’s Best Companies to Work For, and we 
continued to empower our people to give back to their communities 
worldwide, with 50% of our workforce donating more than 1.1
