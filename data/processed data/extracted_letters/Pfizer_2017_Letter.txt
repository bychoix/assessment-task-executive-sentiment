Financial Review
Pfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
domestic and international reporting periods, our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 reflect four 
months of Hospira U.S. operations and three months of Hospira international operations. 
For additional information, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements––Note 2. Acquisitions, Sale of Hospira Infusion Systems Net 
Assets, Research and Development and Collaborative Arrangements, Equity-Method Investments and Cost-Method Investment and the “Our 
Strategy”, “Our Business Development Initiatives” and “Restructuring Charges and Other Costs Associated with Acquisitions and Cost-
Reduction/Productivity Initiatives” sections of this Financial Review.
Impact of Recent Hurricanes in Puerto Rico
We have manufacturing and commercial operations in Puerto Rico, which were impacted by the recent hurricanes toward the end of the third 
quarter in 2017. While our three manufacturing sites sustained some damage and became inoperable due to issues impacting Puerto Rico 
overall, as of the date of this 2017 Financial Report filing, all three sites have resumed operations and remediation activities continue. Given 
prior inoperability along with ongoing remediation of our sites, there could be certain product shortages in the coming months. Our commercial 
sales offices in Puerto Rico have been operational since October 9, 2017.
In 2017, we recorded $195 million in Cost of sales for inventory losses, overhead costs related to the period in which the plants could not 
operate, and incremental costs to date resulting from the hurricanes in Puerto Rico. We may record additional losses in future periods but we 
are unable to predict them with certainty at this time. As a result of dual source supply options and sufficient pre-hurricane inventory levels, we 
currently expect the impact on future revenues to be insignificant. We will continue to monitor the situation closely and make any updates to our 
outlook if warranted. 
Product Manufacturing
We periodically encounter difficulties or delays in manufacturing, including due to legal or regulatory actions, such as warning letters, 
suspension of manufacturing or voluntary recall of a product. In February 2017, for example, we received a warning letter from the FDA 
communicating the FDA’s view that certain violations of current Good Manufacturing Practice regulations exist at Hospira’s manufacturing 
facility in McPherson, Kansas. We are undertaking corrective actions to address the concerns raised by the FDA. In January 2018, the FDA 
upgraded the status of Pfizer’s McPherson, Kansas manufacturing facility to VAI based on an October 2017 inspection. The change to VAI 
status will lift the compliance hold that the FDA placed on approval of pending applications, and is an important step toward resolving the issues 
cited in the February 2017 FDA warning letter. Within our Essential Health portfolio, we have been experiencing product shortages with some 
products. The product shortages are primarily for products from the legacy Hospira portfolio and are largely driven by capacity constraints and 
technical issues. Any continued product shortage interruption at this manufacturing facility could negatively impact our financial results, 
specifically in our SIP portfolio. In addition to the McPherson facility, we continue to remediate issues at other legacy Hospira facilities 
manufacturing sterile injectables within our Essential Health portfolio. We expect to make substantial progress on our remediation efforts during 
2018.
Our 2017 Performance
Revenues––2017
Revenues in 2017 decreased by $278 million, or 1%, compared to 2016, which reflects a slight net operational decrease of $20 million, or less 
than 1%, and an unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of $259 million, or less than 1%.
Compared to 2016, total revenues for 2017 were unfavorably impacted by approximately $200 million as a result of 2017 having one less 
selling day in both U.S. and international markets.
