 Report of the Supervisory Board  
In the course of our work on corporate governance, we further developed and updated 
parts of the Supervisory Board’s skills matrix, which was introduced in 2022. Based on a 
self-assessment, we concluded that the composition of the Supervisory Board at 31 De-
cember 2023 fully meets the targets stipulated in the diversity concept and the competency 
profile. 
In the Declaration of Compliance with the German Corporate Governance Code issued in 
December 2023, the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board confirmed that they 
have complied with the recommendations of the Code as amended on 28 April 2022 with-
out exception and will continue to fully comply with them in future. 
The Board of Management updated the members of the Supervisory Board biannually on 
the current status of the level of attainment of defined financial KPIs and the KPIs for our 
ESG targets, such as deliveries of all-electric automobiles, fleet carbon emissions, attrac-
tiveness as an employer, and diversity. 
In addition, key topics from the Board of Management’s individual areas of 
responsibility were on our agenda. Markets in the USA, Canada and Mexico as well as the 
“fourth pillar” markets, in particular India, South Korea and Japan, were the subject of an in-
depth sales report. We discussed regional resilience and the growth strategy for these mar-
kets in great depth.  
We also dealt with the Group’s compliance management system in great depth. In his an-
nual report, the Chief Compliance Officer presented changes to the structure and content of 
the BMW Group’s compliance management system and the revision of compliance regula-
tions. The report also addressed the implementation of the German Supply Chain Due Dili-
gence Act and the handling of individual cases. Moreover, at the Compliance Days in Mu-
nich, the Chief Compliance Officer relayed a message from the Chairman of the Board of 
Management that set the “tone from the top”, and addressed operational prevention 
measures.  
At each meeting, the Board of Management informed us about the current status of important 
legal framework conditions and regulatory projects. These included in particular the EU’s reg-
ulations regarding fleet carbon emissions in conjunction with the EU’s “Fit for 55” package 
and the Euro 7 emissions standards.  
The Supervisory Board examined the Board of Management’s remuneration in great de-
tail. It reviewed the target structure, maximum remuneration and expected remuneration for 
the Board of Management for the financial year 2023, considering in particular the Group’s 
performance and the development of remuneration for senior executives and employees in 
Germany over the past few years. Based on a comparative study conducted by an external 
independent remuneration consultant and subsequent oral advice, we concluded that the 
remuneration paid to Board of Management members for the financial year 2022 and the 
target remuneration for 2023 were appropriate. Detailed information on the Board of Man-
agement’s remuneration for the financial year 2023 is provided in the Remuneration Re-
port. In December 2023, following thorough preparation by the Personnel Committee, we 
adopted the variable remuneration targets applicable to Board of Management members 
for the financial year 2024, taking into account the budget for 2024, the long-term business 
plan and the BMW Group’s corporate strategy, including its ESG goals. 
In the highly detailed risk report, we were brought up to date with the structure and working 
methods of the risk management system. A key focus of the report was on geopolitical risks, 
especially in the areas of purchasing/supply chains and sales markets as well as the 
presentation of measures to mitigate risk. On the subject of information security with a focus 
on IT security, we were informed about the organisation and functioning of the information 
security management system and the structure of the IT security risk model, as well as the 
measures derived from it and their effectiveness. The Board of Management also reported 
on the business performance, sector-specific risk profile and current projects of the Finan-
cial Services segment. In addition, we received a report on key topics relating to the Group’s 
treasury system, such as funding, liquidity management, hedging strategies for price and 
currency risks and the current state of share buyback programmes.  
In conjunction with the report on HR-related strategies, we looked at the BMW Group’s at-
tractiveness as an employer, employee performance and commitment, and workforce avail-
ability. The Board of Management also brought us up to date on the status of the Group’s 
diversity concepts and the extent to which targets have been achieved regarding the pro-
portion of women employed at various levels.  
In December 2022, the Supervisory Board agreed to the plan to hold the Annual General 
Meeting 2023 on a virtual basis in accordance with the regulations applicable at the time. In 
March 2023, the detailed concept proposed by the Board of Management was approved. 
With regard to the Annual General Meeting 2024, the Board of Management explained the 
reasons for its decision in favour of the virtual format to the Supervisory Board.

 Report of the Supervisory Board  
The BMW Group’s long-term business plan was the subject of comprehensive examina-
tion by the Supervisory Board. In view of the ramp-up of electric mobility in an environment 
that remains challenging and volatile, the focus was on safeguarding growth and returns. 
The Board of Management informed us about plans for the various vehicle and corporate 
segments and ambitious long-term targets, while confirming its key objectives for growth, 
market shares and profitability. We were presented with key financial indicators for each 
segment, in addition to opportunities and risks for the planning period. After thorough ex-
amination, the Supervisory Board approved the long-term business plan drawn up by the 
Board of Management.  
In December 2023, the Board of Management presented the budget for the financial year 
2024. After exhaustive discussion with the Board of Management, we gave the budget our 
approval. 
I also met with investor representatives on a regular basis to discuss topics specific to the 
Supervisory Board during the financial year 2023. We touched on corporate governance 
issues such as succession planning for the Supervisory Board, the system for the Board of 
Management’s remuneration and the future format of the Annual General Meeting as well 
as committee work and the Supervisory Board’s handling of geopolitical risks.  
With the BMW Group’s support, Supervisory Board members attended advanced training 
courses on various topics during 2023. At our July meeting held at the BMW Group’s Leip-
zig plant, the subject of which was “BMW Group Production – Electrified. Digital. Sustaina-
ble”, we discussed the topic of sustainability in production and energy generation at BMW 
Group sites. In September, we took a first in-depth look at the Group’s technology, architec-
ture and product strategy for the period as of 2025, and more closely at the strategic mod-
ules of the NEUE KLASSE. The members of the Supervisory Board then tested new BMW, 
MINI and Rolls-Royce models at the BMW M Driving Academy in Maisach. This involved a 
drive on the A8 motorway in the new BMW 5 Series sedan, where we tried out the level 2+ 
Highway Assistant. In addition, we were presented with BMW brand design vehicles, sup-
plemented by a preview of the NEUE KLASSE. A talk by a renowned Chinese economics 
expert on the state of the Chinese economy in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic and on 
opportunities for multinational corporations provided some interesting insights into the Chi-
nese market. The Supervisory Board held two hybrid meetings in October and November at 
which the heads of the responsible internal departments and an external consultant pro-
vided us with a comprehensive update on non-financial reporting and the EU taxonomy, fo-
cusing on implementation by the BMW Group. We also delved more deeply into the complex 
processes involved in implementing and reviewing the ambitious decarbonisation targets 
within the supply chain as well as the main levers for decarbonisation in this area. 
The onboarding programme for new Supervisory Board members was also continued in 
2023. As part of the programme, new members are given an insight into the BMW Group’s 
key business areas and planning processes by representatives of internal specialist depart-
ments. The programme also includes an introduction to the ongoing work of the Supervisory 
Board.  
In late 2023, we reviewed the effectiveness of the work of the Supervisory Board and its 
committees with the aid of a questionnaire, and discussed the findings in our subsequent 
meeting. Cooperation both within the Supervisory Board and with the Board of Manage-
ment was unanimously perceived as constructive and trustworthy. In the current financial 
year, we intend to act on proposals to explore certain topics in greater depth, such as bat-
tery technology and the circular economy concept.  
The Supervisory Board is careful to avoid any conflicts of interest in the course of its deliber-
ations and decision-making processes. No conflicts of interest occurred in the financial year 
2023.  
Description of Presiding Board activities and committee work  
The Supervisory Board has established a Presiding Board and four committees. At each 
subsequent Supervisory Board meeting, the Chairman of the Audit Committee, Dr Bock, 
and myself reported in detail on the work of the Presiding Committee and the other commit-
tees. Further information on the duties, composition and working methods of the Presiding 
Board as well as the various other committees is provided in the Statement of Corporate 
Governance on the BMW Group website. 
Unless a particular committee was responsible, the Presiding Board prepared the topics for 
the plenary meetings at its four meetings in cooperation with the Board of Management and 
senior heads of department. It also put forward proposals for reporting within the Supervi-
sory Board. The Presiding Board focused especially on the corporate strategy and its sus-
tainability-related aspects, in addition to longer-term corporate planning. The report on the 
BMW Group’s position was discussed in detail at every meeting of the Presiding Board. 
The Audit Committee convened eight times in total. 
In March 2023, the focus was on preparing for the Supervisory Board meeting at which the 
financial statements for the financial year 2022 were discussed and examined. After verify-
ing the matter of independence, the Audit Committee recommended to the Supervisory 
Board that PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft (“PwC”) be 
elected auditor at the Annual General Meeting 2023. There were no indications of conflicts 
of interest, grounds for exclusion or lack of independence on the part of the auditor.

 Report of the Supervisory Board  
The Audit Committee concluded that PwC’s fee proposal for the audit of the Company and 
Group Financial Statements and the BMW Group Report 2023, as well as for the review of 
the Half-Year Report 2023, was appropriate in light of the scope of its tasks. The Commit-
tee therefore issued the corresponding contracts to PwC following its election at the Annual 
General Meeting in May 2023. 
The Audit Committee also specified supplementary audit focus areas. Moreover, it approved 
the scope of the non-audit services to be performed, and received regular reports from PwC 
regarding these services. At its meetings, the Audit Committee discussed the quality of the 
audit in depth on several occasions. In particular, it received a report from the relevant de-
partment on the Group’s experience with the audit of the financial statements for the finan-
cial year 2022 and on the results of the survey conducted within the Group for this purpose. 
Based on this report, the auditor’s description of the quality assurance measures under-
taken, and the Audit Committee’s own experience with the auditor, the audit was found be 
of good quality.  
The Audit Committee also examined the combined Non-financial Statement of BMW AG 
and the BMW Group for the financial year 2022, which was part of the BMW Group Report 
2022. The Audit Committee had representatives from PwC explain the results of their audit. 
We have again engaged PwC to conduct a “limited assurance” audit of the Non-financial 
(Group) Statement for the financial year 2023, to the extent that it relates to parts of the 
management report that are not subject to a ”reasonable assurance” audit. Going beyond 
the formal review required by law, the Audit Committee also engaged PwC to audit the con-
tents of the Remuneration Report for the financial year 2023. 
The Quarterly Statements were presented to us for discussion by the Audit Committee prior 
to their publication by the Board of Management. Representatives of the external auditors 
were also present when the Half-Year Financial Report was discussed in early August 
2023. 
The Board of Management informed the Audit Committee regarding the implementation of 
the first share buyback programme (which the Audit Committee had already approved in 
2022), the redemption of the shares on 18 July 2023 and related reduction in share capital, 
as well as the second share buyback programme resolved by the Board of Management in 
May 2023. 
At its meeting in July 2023, the Audit Committee considered the effectiveness and appropri-
ateness of the BMW Group’s internal control system (including the Corporate Audit func-
tion), the compliance management system and the risk management system. In the half-
yearly risk reports, we addressed the principal risks facing the BMW Group and their classifi-
cation. We focused particularly on geopolitical risks and the resulting risk scenarios, espe-
cially for supply chains and sales markets, as well as measures to mitigate these risks. 
We also addressed the topic of climate-related risks. We regularly monitor the further devel-
opment of the internal control system for non-financial reporting with regard to the Group’s 
sustainability-related targets. 
The head of Corporate Audit presented us with the key audit findings and plans for further 
internal audits. The Chief Compliance Officer of the BMW Group reported on the structural 
development of the compliance management system, the implementation of operational 
measures and further planning. The report also addressed the implementation of the Ger-
man Supply Chain Due Diligence Act. In addition, we received a report on the BMW Group’s 
tax and customs control system from the responsible head of department. 
In its report on the audit of over-the-counter derivatives entered into by BMW AG during the 
financial year 2022, the external auditor confirmed to the Audit Committee the effectiveness 
of the system in place at BMW AG in complying with the regulatory requirements of the Eu-
ropean Market Infrastructure Regulation.  
The Audit Committee received regular reports on the state and development of significant 
legal proceedings and internal investigations and, in individual cases, discussed product- 
and emissions-related proceedings with external legal advisors brought in for that purpose.  
In its role as a preparatory body, in the course of 2023 the Personnel Committee convened 
four times to deliberate on the remuneration of, and succession planning for, the Board of 
Management. The review of the appropriateness of the Board of Management’s remunera-
tion for the financial years 2022 and 2023 and the determination of the factors for the 
Board of Management’s variable remuneration for those years were the subjects of thor-
ough preparation within the Personnel Committee. The determination of financial and ESG 
targets for the Board of Management’s remuneration for the financial year 2024 was also 
discussed in great detail. In addition, the Personnel Committee prepared for the change of 
remuneration consultant in the financial year 2023. The renewal of the anticipatory resolu-
tion on the approval of loans and transactions by BMW Bank GmbH was also on the 
agenda.  
The Nomination Committee held one meeting in the financial year 2023 in which it dis-
cussed the composition of shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board. Taking 
into account the composition requirements resolved by the Supervisory Board and the rec-
ommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code, the Nomination Committee is-
sued recommendations for the Supervisory Board’s election proposals to the Annual Gen-
eral Meeting to be held in 2024. 
The Mediation Committee, which is prescribed by law, did not need to convene during the 
financial year under report.

 Report of the Supervisory Board  
Composition of the Board of Management 
The Supervisory Board resolved to extend the term of office of one member and appointed 
two new members to the Board of Management in the financial year 2023.  
The Supervisory Board extended the mandate of Oliver Zipse, the Chairman of the Board of 
Management.  
Dr Nicolas Peter left the Board of Management on 11 May 2023 by mutual agreement as 
part of a succession arrangement following three decades of successful work at the BMW 
Group. As the Board of Management member responsible for Finance, he played a key role 
in shaping the development of the BMW Group with his profound expertise, entrepreneurial 
flair and vision. His work served to further cement the Group’s excellent reputation, both on 
the capital market and in the public eye. We are greatly indebted to Nicolas Peter for his out-
standing contribution.  
On 12 May 2023, Walter Mertl was appointed as member of the Board of Management re-
sponsible for Finance. He joined the BMW Group in 1998 and was most recently responsi-
ble for corporate controlling. Mr Mertl has embodied the Group’s commitment to sustainable 
profitability during the transformation for many years.  
On 31 October 2023, Pieter Nota left the Board of Management by mutual agreement, also 
in line with the BMW Group’s succession plans. After becoming the member of the Board of 
Management responsible for Customer, Brands and Sales in 2018, Mr Nota was a key fig-
ure in driving forward the sale of all-electric models and the digitalisation of the customer 
interface. He was also responsible for introducing a pioneering agency model for direct 
sales in selected markets. We wish to thank Pieter Nota for his excellent work and valuable 
inspiration.  
On 1 November 2023, Jochen Goller was appointed as member of the Board of Manage-
ment responsible for Customer, Brands and Sales. Mr Goller has been at the BMW Group 
since 1999 and has headed up activities in the China region since 2018. In Jochen Goller, 
we have appointed an internationally experienced sales manager with particular expertise in 
the Chinese market to the Board of Management. 
Composition of the Supervisory Board, the Presiding Board and the Supervisory 
Board’s committees  
There were no changes to the composition of the Supervisory Board during the past year on 
the shareholder representative side. The Annual General Meeting elected Dr Kurt Bock to 
the Supervisory Board for a further term of office of approximately four years. He was sub-
sequently appointed as Deputy Chairman of the Supervisory Board, member of the Presid-
ing Board and of the Personnel Committee as well as member and Chairman of the Audit 
Committee. 
With regard to the employee representatives, in January 2023 Dr Martin Kimmich was ap-
pointed to succeed the departing long-serving First Deputy Chairman of the Supervisory 
Board, Manfred Schoch, for his remaining term of office. Dr Kimmich has been Chairman of 
the Munich Works Council and the BMW AG Works Council since 2022. 
Disclosure of attendance at meetings by individual members 
The attendance rate at Supervisory Board meetings was 99%, and 100% for the meetings 
held by the various committees and the Presiding Board. The meetings were held in person, 
with individual members participating virtually only in justified exceptional cases. Three meet-
ings of the Audit Committee that dealt with the quarterly reports were held as hybrid meet-
ings, with individual members connected by either telephone or video call as planned. Indi-
vidual meeting attendance can be seen in the table below:

 Report of the Supervisory Board  
Review of financial statements and the profit distribution proposal 
PwC was appointed external auditor for the financial year 2023. PwC initially conducted a 
review of the condensed Interim Group Financial Statements and the Interim Group Man-
agement Report for the first half of 2023 and presented its findings to the Audit Committee. 
No issues were identified that might indicate that the condensed Interim Group Financial 
Statements and Interim Group Management Report had not been prepared in accordance 
with the applicable provisions in all material respects. 
The Company Financial Statements and the Group Financial Statements of BMW AG for the 
financial year ended 31 December 2023, including the Combined Management Report, on 
which PwC has issued unqualified audit opinions, were authorised by the Board of Manage-
ment on 12 March 2024. These audit opinions were signed for the fifth consecutive finan-
cial year by independent auditor Petra Justenhoven (Wirtschaftsprüferin) and, for the second 
time, by Michael Popp (Wirtschaftsprüfer) as the auditor responsible for the performance of 
the engagement.  
At its meeting held on 29 February 2024, the Audit Committee initially gave in-depth con-
sideration to the preliminary version of the Company and Group Financial Statements and 
the Combined Management Report (including the combined Non-financial (Group) State-
ment and the information on the EU taxonomy) as well as the draft version of the auditor’s 
long-form reports.  
Immediately after authorising their issue, the Board of Management submitted the Com-
pany and Group Financial Statements for the financial year 2023 and the Combined Man-
agement Report (including the Combined Non-financial (Group) Statement) to the Supervi-
sory Board. The auditor’s long-form audit reports were also submitted to the Supervisory 
Board in a prompt manner. In order to facilitate preparations, drafts of these documents had 
already been made available to the Supervisory Board in advance. 
At its meeting held on 13 March 2024, the Audit Committee diligently examined and delib-
erated on these documents before they were considered in detail at the plenary session of 
the Supervisory Board on 14 March 2024.  
At the two respective meetings, the Board of Management provided a detailed explanation 
of the reporting documents submitted to the Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board. 
The representatives of the external auditor reported on the main findings of their audit and 
answered questions put to them by members of the Audit Committee and the Supervisory 
Board, partially without the presence of the members of the Board of Management. Both 
the Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board gave meticulous consideration to the key 
audit matters and the related audit procedures. 
The representatives of the external auditors confirmed that the risk management system 
established by the Board of Management is capable of identifying at an early stage any de-
velopments that might threaten the Company’s going-concern status. They also confirmed 
that no material weaknesses in the internal control system and risk management system 
were identified with regard to the financial reporting process. 
In the course of their audit work, they did not identify any facts inconsistent with the con-
tents of the Declaration of Compliance pursuant to § 161 of the German Stock Corporation 
Act (AktG) jointly issued by the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board. 
Based on a thorough examination conducted by the Audit Committee and the Supervisory 
Board, we concurred with the results of the external audit. In accordance with the final result 
of this examination, no objections were raised. At our meeting held on 14 March 2024, we 
accordingly approved the Group and Company Financial Statements of BMW AG for the fi-
nancial year 2023. The Company Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 
2023 have therefore been adopted. 
Furthermore, in both the Audit Committee and the full Supervisory Board, we examined the 
Board of Management’s proposal to use the unappropriated profit to pay a dividend of 
€ 6.00 for each share of common stock entitled to receive a dividend and € 6.02 for each 
share of preferred stock entitled to receive a dividend and to transfer the remaining amount 
to other revenue reserves. We consider the proposal appropriate and have therefore ap-
proved it. 
Based on the preparatory work of the Audit Committee, the Supervisory Board and the 
Board of Management jointly prepared the Remuneration Report for the financial year 2023 
in accordance with § 162 AktG. At the request of the Audit Committee, PwC reviewed the 
contents of the Remuneration Report, reported to both the Audit Committee and the Super-
visory Board on the results of the review, and confirmed that the Remuneration Report com-
plies with the financial reporting provisions contained in § 162 AktG in all material respects.  
The Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board also carefully examined the combined 
Non-financial (Group) Statement for the year ended 31 December 2023. Following an in-
depth explanation of the statement by the Board of Management, representatives of PwC 
presented the key findings of their audit and answered additional questions posed by the 
members of the Supervisory Board. Based on the “limited assurance” audit performed by 
PwC on those parts of the Management Report and certain sustainability disclosures in the 
integrated BMW Group Report 2023 that were not subject to a reasonable assurance en-
gagement, PWC issued an unqualified opinion, signed for the second time by Michael Popp 
(Wirtschaftsprüfer) and for the first time by Annette Fink.

Expression of appreciation by the Supervisory Board  
With their great dedication and an outstanding collaborative effort during the past financial 
year, the members of the Board of Management and the employees of the BMW Group 
worldwide successfully defended the BMW brand’s leading position in the global premium 
segment and significantly expanded the share of electric mobility in Group sales. We there-
fore wish to express our deep thanks and appreciation to all of them.  
We are confident that the Board of Management and the BMW Group’s workforce will con-
tinue to pursue the BMW Group’s chosen path of sustainable and digitalised mobility in 
2024, and we eagerly await the launch of the NEUE KLASSE in 2025.

You know your Company: we always think ahead. 
We deliver what we say we are going to do – systematically, without making excuses, con-
sistently and reliably. Becoming a little bit better every day – that is what I expect from the 
Company and from myself. That is how we move forward – bringing ambitious goals closer 
and gradually turning them into reality. Society likes to talk about the transformation of mo-
bility and the automotive industry. 
At the BMW Group, we call it continuous progress. 
That is what the BMW Group stands for, like no other company. It is one of the reasons why 
you, our shareholders, continue to stand by us.
