DEAR STAKEHOLDERS,
WE’VE 
TRANSFORMED 
OUR COMPANY
We remain the world’s leading PC graphics chip company.  
But we are now much more. We create software-rich visual  
computing products for PCs, data centers, and mobile devices. 
Our reinvention has allowed us  
to continue to grow despite  
the slowing PC market.

WE’VE 
TRANSFORMED 
OUR COMPANY
Our financial results reached record levels in fiscal 2015, 
with revenue up 13 percent to $4.7 billion and gross margins 
widening 60 basis points to 55.5 percent. GAAP EPS rose 
51 percent to $1.12 a share. And we returned $1 billion to 
shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases.
The successful execution of our strategies drove a year  
of progress:
>   We created new products that bring our world-leading 
visual computing capabilities to customers through 
mobile and cloud platforms. Our data center and cloud 
platform businesses, Tesla and GRID, grew 60 percent. 
Our mobile platform businesses, including auto,  
grew 45 percent.
>   We introduced specialized, software-rich visual  
computing products for large vertical markets. Our 
market share for discrete GPUs hit a record 72 percent – 
not only because our GeForce GPUs are best-in-class, 
but because GeForce is a “game platform” within the  
PC, and is loved by gamers all over the world.
>   We launched SHIELD, our first living-room entertainment 
device, in March 2015. SHIELD is the most advanced 
smart TV device on the market, and early reviews have 
been fantastic. Smart TV consoles are revolutionizing our 
TV experience, just as smartphones revolutionized mobile 
communications. Tens of millions of these devices are 
sold each year, with growth over 50 percent annually.  
We see this as a very large market where we can make  
a great, sustainable contribution. 
>   Our invention engine continues to fire. We introduced  
Maxwell, our 10th generation GPU architecture and a  
breakthrough in performance and efficiency. We also 
launched Tegra X1, our latest mobile superchip, which  
is at the heart of our DRIVE automotive computers and  
our SHIELD devices. 
We faced challenges during the year in commodity phone 
and PC markets. But our strategy is to engage component 
opportunities only where OEMs value our differentiation.  
And to focus our resources on growth markets – gaming, 
automotive, enterprise, and high performance computing  
& cloud.

MAKING AN IMPACT
The people of NVIDIA share a passion for community service 
and a deep sense of corporate responsibility. 
Our philanthropic giving this year totaled $4.8 million, 
including more than $2 million toward Stanford University’s 
investments in medical research, teaching, and a new  
state-of-the-art hospital.
We proudly awarded our first annual $150,000 Global Impact 
Award, recognizing the groundbreaking use of GPUs to 
address social, humanitarian, and environmental problems. 
The winner, out of more than two dozen outstanding 
candidates, was the San Diego Supercomputer Center 
for its work developing seismic simulations that help us 
understand conditions that cause earthquakes. 
Our philanthropic efforts are driven by the NVIDIA 
Foundation, one of the industry’s few employee-run giving 
initiatives, which ensures that our energies in this area 
reflect our employees’ priorities. 
The Foundation’s flagship program, Compute the Cure, 
focuses on funding research that uses innovative 
computing techniques in the fight against cancer.  
Our $1.6 million invested in Compute the Cure in recent 
years includes major grants to research teams at the  
Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Stanford.
Project Inspire brings together our people, along with  
their families and friends, to transform their local 
communities. It continues to gain momentum, with offices 
worldwide participating. 
In Santa Clara, our employees made extensive physical 
improvements to Fischer Middle School, a school in an 
underserved part of our community. Our own investment of 
some $600,000 in labor and materials was joined by nearly 
$200,000 from other local companies and nonprofits. 
In Courbevoie, France, we transformed Centre  
Franchemont School. And in Westford, Massachusetts,  
our office made over a local Boys and Girls Club. 
Over the course of the year, employees contributed more  
than 15,500 volunteer hours. Many chose to support 
education programs and activities that, in total, benefited 
more than 67,000 children. 
All of these efforts reflect the dedication and spirit of our 
employees, which benefit the less fortunate and brings  
us closer as a team. 
THE ROAD AHEAD
I am delighted by NVIDIA’s transformation this year.  
We have innovated beyond PCs, and emerged as a growth 
company which offers products that are having great  
success in the large mobile and cloud markets. 
Our innovation is revolutionizing the markets we serve.  
With our new business model, we can see a clear path  
to sustain our growth and are excited by the opportunity  
to build a company many times our current size. Most 
importantly, we are making important contributions to 
science, industry, customers, and our community that  
make me incredibly proud. 
I want to thank the employees of NVIDIA for their 
extraordinary achievements this year. All we’ve achieved  
is only possible with their innovation and dedication. 
Sincerely,
Jen-Hsun Huang
CEO & Co-founder, NVIDIA
