Group Chairman’s statement
We see the new Code as an opportunity  
to further enhance our existing stakeholder 
engagement, ensuring that the business as a 
whole can continue to develop constructive  
and considerate relationships with all those  
with whom we work. We will include details  
of this in the Annual Report and Accounts 2019.
“ The Board fully endorses the Group’s 
commitment to develop and support our people 
and we offer the Group Management Board our 
wholehearted support in realising that ambition.”
Connecting customers to opportunities
The financial targets that John announced in  
June remain appropriate, even as the global 
economic outlook becomes less predictable.  
Our ability to meet them depends on being  
able to help our customers manage the present 
uncertainty and capture the opportunities  
that unquestionably exist.
The system of global trade remains subject to 
political pressure, and differences between  
China and the US will likely continue to inform 
sentiment in 2019. However, the conclusion  
of major trade agreements – including the 
Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement  
for Trans-Pacific Partnership; the EU’s landmark 
bilateral agreements with Japan and Singapore; 
and the potential ratification of the US-Mexico-
Canada Agreement in 2019 – provide important 
counterweights that could give impetus to 
international trade in the year ahead.
The fundamentals for growth in Asia remain strong 
in spite of a softer regional economic outlook. The 
structural and financial reforms underway across 
the region should continue to support economic 
development. China remains subject to domestic 
and external pressures, but we expect it to maintain 
strong growth. We also expect further financial 
liberalisation to form part of China’s response to 
changing external conditions. This will benefit 
domestic and international customers and investors.
The US economy and the influence of the Federal 
Reserve remain central to global sentiment. We 
expect policymakers to adopt a more cautious 
stance in 2019, even as the economy continues  
to grow. A slowdown in the pace of US interest 
rate rises could carry positive implications for  
Asian economies and businesses, as well as  
for US growth. Both the Mexican and Canadian 
economies are poised to grow at a steady pace.
Many of our UK customers are understandably 
cautious about the immediate future, given the 
prolonged uncertainty surrounding the UK’s exit 
from the European Union. HSBC UK, our new  
UK ring-fenced bank, has an important role in 
supporting our customers as they prepare for a 
range of possible outcomes. Our universal banking 
business in France will also help provide continuity 
to our customers in the UK and the rest of Europe. 
In Europe, as elsewhere, we are confident in our 
ability to help customers make the most of the 
opportunities they see.
There are more risks to global economic growth 
than this time last year, and we remain alive and 
responsive to all possibilities. Our strong balance 
sheet and revenue base equip us to navigate these 
risks and, most importantly, enable us to help our 
customers negotiate their own paths.

Fulfilling our potential
Many thanks
Enabling our people to do their jobs to the best  
of their ability is a priority for the Board, and for  
me personally. They are essential to our present 
and future success. The Board fully endorses the 
Group’s commitment to develop and support our 
people and we offer the Group Management  
Board our wholehearted support in realising  
that ambition.
My thanks go to John and each of the 235,000 
people who work for HSBC. Their hard work, 
commitment and talent has been key to the 
Group’s progress in 2018. Our challenge and 
shared purpose is to build on that good work 
through the rest of 2019 and beyond. I have  
every confidence we can do so.
“ Our strong balance sheet and revenue base 
equip us to navigate these risks and, most 
importantly, enable us to help our customers 
negotiate their own paths.”
Mark E Tucker
Group Chairman
19 February 2019
I had the honour of officially opening the new 
headquarters of HSBC UK in Birmingham in 
December. As well as providing a new home for 
the UK ring-fenced bank, One Centenary Square 
houses the European hub of HSBC University,  
our global learning and development centre.  
Since then, we have opened new HSBC University 
hubs at our new premises in Dubai, and in Mexico  
City. These cutting-edge facilities form part of  
our response to the complex challenges our 
employees now face working for a global bank  
in an unpredictable environment. HSBC University 
aims not only to equip them with the right skills, 
but also to help them understand the culture that 
will continue to make HSBC a unique organisation.

Group Chief Executive’s 
review
Helping our people be at their best is the critical enabler 
of our business strategy and fundamental to delivering 
our financial targets.
John Flint Group Chief Executive
In June 2018, I set out a plan to get HSBC growing 
again and to create value for shareholders. While 
this targets clear financial outcomes, it has our 
customers at its centre. We want to bring more  
of HSBC to more people and to serve them in the 
best possible way.
“ We want to bring more of HSBC to  
more people and to serve them in the  
best possible way.”
The eight strategic priorities that I outlined  
in June are the key to achieving these aims.  
We are seeking to connect more customers  
to our international network and high-growth 
markets. We are working to improve our capital 
efficiency and to turn our US business around.  
We are investing in technology and our digital 
capabilities to serve our customers better and  
stay competitive. We are also taking steps to 
support our people more effectively and help  
them be at their best.
I am encouraged by our progress so far. We  
are growing customer numbers and capturing 
market share in our scale markets and from our 
international network. Our US business is short  
of where we want it to be, but is moving in the 
right direction. Our investment in technology is 
making our business simpler, safer, and easier  
for our customers to use. We have launched new 
products and made strategic hires in mainland 
China and Hong Kong that are materially improving 
our service to international clients. We have also 
established our UK ring-fenced bank.
These were important factors in our 2018 financial 
performance. Revenue growth in our four global 
businesses helped deliver higher Group reported 
and adjusted profit before tax. Group return on 
tangible equity – our headline measure – was also 
up significantly from 6.8% in 2017 to 8.6%. This is  
a good first step towards meeting our return on 
tangible equity target of more than 11% by 2020.
Engaging our people
HSBC has a strong and proud culture. We 
understand our role and our purpose, and that 
HSBC exists to serve others. As Group Chief 
Executive, I have a responsibility to nurture and 
preserve those aspects of our culture that serve  
us well. I also recognise that I have a responsibility 
to improve aspects of our behaviours that may  
be impeding our performance.
In my first year in this role, I started a conversation 
throughout the bank about how we help our 
people be the best version of themselves. This is 
part of a broader ambition to create what we call 
the healthiest human system in our industry.
7

--- Page 10 ---
Strategic Report | Group Chief Executive’s review
There is more that we can do to create an 
environment that is sufficiently supportive, 
protective and engaging. We need to have more 
open and honest conversations. This is the least 
that our people should be able to expect. If we 
cannot provide it, it hurts our ability to serve not 
just our customers, but all the stakeholder groups 
on whom our success depends. It also impedes 
our ability to deliver our strategy and our targets.
We have started by signalling to our people  
that creating a safe and supportive working 
environment is a strategic priority for the business. 
Leaders are being encouraged to model the right 
behaviours and provide direction on the type of 
behaviour we expect. We are also opening 
conversations around issues like mental  
health, well-being, bullying and harassment.
We are making material changes to the 
organisation that allow us to support our people 
more effectively. Our governance procedures  
are being simplified and strengthened to reduce 
complexity and make it easier for people to do their 
jobs. We are also helping our people work more 
flexibly. On learning and development, we have 
opened new HSBC University hubs around the 
world and improved access to digital training.
“ HSBC has a strong and proud culture.  
We understand our role and our purpose,  
and that HSBC exists to serve others.”
At an individual level, every person at HSBC  
is being encouraged to think about how we  
create the healthiest human system in our  
industry, and to play an active role in doing so.  
We are regularly collecting feedback from our 
people and it is informing the action we are taking.
The early signs are positive. In 2018, 66% of our 
employees said they would recommend HSBC  
as a great place to work, up from 64% the previous 
year. While this demonstrates an improvement in  
a relatively short space of time, it also shows that 
we have much further to go. This work will 
continue into 2019 and beyond. If we are 
successful, then we will materially improve  
all aspects of HSBC’s performance, including 
delivery of our strategy.
Business performance
All four global businesses grew adjusted  
revenue in 2018.
Retail Banking and Wealth Management had  
a very good year. Higher interest rates, rising 
customer numbers, and growth of more than 
$20bn in our UK and Hong Kong mortgage book  
all contributed to a strong rise in Retail Banking 
adjusted revenue. Despite a good performance  
in the first three quarters of the year, Wealth 
Management adjusted revenue fell slightly in  
2018 due to the effects of market volatility in  
the fourth quarter.
Commercial Banking had an excellent 2018, 
delivering double-digit adjusted revenue growth  
on the back of an outstanding performance in 
Global Liquidity and Cash Management. Credit  
and Lending generated adjusted revenue growth 
from higher balances, despite lower margins from 
increased competition. Solid performances in Asia 
and Europe enabled Global Trade and Receivables 
Finance to grow adjusted revenue despite an 
increasingly difficult environment for trade.
Global Banking and Markets grew adjusted 
revenue in spite of considerably reduced market 
activity in the fourth quarter. Our market-leading 
transaction banking franchises generated strong 
increases in adjusted revenue, which exceeded  
the reduction in markets-related revenue from 
Rates, Credit, and Equities.
Global Private Banking returned to growth in 2018 
on the back of new business won in Hong Kong. 
Adjusted revenue from deposits also increased on 
the back of interest rate rises.
Adjusted jaws was negative for 2018. While 
adjusted costs were broadly as we expected for  
the full year, adjusted revenue fell short due to 
market weakness in the fourth quarter. Positive 
jaws remains an important discipline in delivering 
our financial targets and we remain committed  
to it in 2019.
8

--- Page 11 ---
Group Chief Executive’s review
Expected credit losses were slightly higher than 
loan impairment charges in 2017, reflecting the 
uncertain economic outlook in the UK  
and heightened downside risks.
We plan to achieve positive adjusted jaws in 2019 
and remain focused on achieving a return on 
tangible equity of over 11% by 2020, while 
maintaining a stable dividend.
Our common equity tier 1 ratio of 14% was lower 
than at the same point in 2017, due mainly to 
adverse foreign exchange movements and the 
impact of higher lending.
“ Despite more challenging market conditions at 
the end of year and a weaker global economic 
outlook, we are committed to the targets we 
announced in June.”
John Flint
Group Chief Executive
19 February 2019
We returned a total of $2bn to shareholders 
through share buy-backs in 2018, reflecting our 
desire to neutralise the impact of scrip dividends 
over the medium term. We remain committed  
to this policy, subject to regulatory approval.
Outlook
We have made a good start to 2019. Our Group 
revenue performance in January was ahead of our 
plan for the month and actual credit performance 
remained robust, albeit with some softening of 
credit performance in the UK. We continue to 
prepare for the UK’s departure from the EU in  
order to provide continuity for our customers in  
the UK and mainland Europe. Our well-established 
universal bank in France gives us a major 
advantage in this regard. Our immediate priority  
is to help our customers manage the present 
uncertainty.
Despite more challenging market conditions at  
the end of the year and a weaker global economic 
outlook, we are committed to the targets we 
announced in June. We remain alert to the 
downside risks of the current economic 
environment, especially those relating to the UK 
economy, global trade tensions and the future path 
of interest rates. We will be proactive in managing 
costs and investment to meet the risks to revenue 
growth where necessary, but we will not take 
short-term decisions that harm the long-term 
interests of the business.

Client examples

Euroimmun:

CLP Holdings Limited (‘CLP’): 
power and utilities, Hong Kong
Imagination, a creative agency 
and fast-growing global authority 
on brand experience, found  
itself outgrowing its banking 
relationship and constrained  
by its bank’s local focus. HSBC 
provided Imagination with the 
benefits of a robust international 
network including greater access 
to debt and liquidity, an optimised 
banking experience across 10 
countries through HSBCnet, and 
an integration with Imagination’s 
enterprise resource planning 
system for holistic viewing of 
transactions and account details.
Euroimmun was acquired by a  
US medical technology company.  
Both companies were long-standing 
CMB clients, so HSBC was 
mandated with settlement of the 
consideration. An introduction to 
HSBC’s GPB business in Germany 
led to Euroimmun’s largest 
shareholder and its Chief Financial 
Officer placing the majority of sale 
proceeds with GPB. Through 
collaboration between our CMB, 
GB&M and GPB businesses, we 
were able to provide multi-product 
solutions during critical events for 
the client.
CLP, a Hong Kong-listed pan-Asian 
power business, is committed  
to supporting the Hong Kong 
government’s target to reduce carbon 
intensity by 65–70% by 2030 from 
2005 levels. HSBC has assisted CLP  
as Sole Adviser in establishing the  
‘CLP climate action finance framework’ 
to attract qualified investments in  
the transitioning to a low-carbon 
economy. Under this framework, HSBC 
acted as a joint bookrunner on the 
debut $500m Reg S Energy Transition 
Bond issued by Castle Peak Power 
Company Limited, to help finance  
the development of a new gas-fired 
generation unit in Hong Kong.

Strategic Report
Strategic priorities
We entered the next phase of our strategy in 2018, focused on growth and 
creating value for our stakeholders. 
Return to growth and value creation
In our June 2018 Strategy Update,  
we outlined eight strategic priorities  
to deliver growth, improve returns, 
empower our people, and enhance our 
customer experience. Each priority has  
a target or set of targeted outcomes  
by 2020. The table opposite contains  
a summary of our progress, with 
additional details provided below.
purchasing of homes, as we grew our 
mortgage market share to 6.6%8. For  
our corporate clients, we launched our 
largest ever dedicated SME fund, with 
£12bn of funding, including £1bn of 
funding to help UK companies grow 
overseas. While HSBC UK has seen  
initial growth in retail customers (up  
by 251,000, a growth of 2%), we are  
still driving initiatives to grow our 
commercial customer base.
Growth from areas of strength
Strategic priority 1: We made a strong 
start in accelerating growth from our 
Asian franchise after making select 
investments in areas such as Hong 
Kong and our wealth business. Overall, 
Asia adjusted revenue was 11% higher 
than the previous year with double-
digit growth in Hong Kong, mainland 
China and the Pearl River Delta. 
Despite some market uncertainty, we 
continued to support customers as  
we increased loan balances by 9%.  
Our wealth business in Asia7 gained 
positive momentum with double-digit 
revenue growth in Private Banking and 
Asset Management, and 4% growth in 
RBWM Wealth distribution. However, 
Asia Insurance manufacturing revenue 
was down 11% versus 2017 due to 
adverse market conditions.
We continue to support clients and 
economies through the China-led Belt 
and Road Initiative, and FinanceAsia 
recognised our market leadership by 
awarding us the ‘Best Belt and Road 
Bank’ in Asia for the second 
consecutive year.
In sustainable finance, our goal is  
to be a leading partner for our clients  
to help the world’s transition to a 
low-carbon economy. We have made 
good progress with our ambition  
to provide $100bn of sustainable 
financing, facilitation and investment 
by 2025, with a cumulative total of 
$28.5bn delivered in 2017 and 2018. 
For further details on our sustainable 
finance commitment, see page 27.
Strategic priority 2: We completed  
the set-up of our UK ring-fenced bank, 
HSBC UK, six months ahead of the  
legal deadline, and we opened our  
new UK head office in Birmingham.  
We supported our retail customers’ 
12
Strategic priority 3: We continue to  
make investments to enable growth in  
our international network. In Global Trade 
and Receivables Finance (‘GTRF’), we  
are investing in a transformation of our 
operating model to help clients and 
colleagues conduct trade and manage 
capital more efficiently. In Securities 
Services, we are developing our digital 
proposition across many products.  
We are on track to achieve our target  
of mid to high single-digit revenue 
growth by 2020. International client 
revenue was up 7% compared with  
2017; transaction banking revenue  
grew 14%, driven by double-digit  
growth across Global Liquidity and  
Cash Management (‘GLCM’), Foreign 
Exchange and Securities Services.  
GTRF revenue grew by 2%, reflecting  
the subdued global trade environment.
Turnaround of low-return 
businesses
Strategic priority 4: The US turnaround  
is our most challenging strategic priority. 
Our US return on tangible equity (‘RoTE’) 
increased from 0.9% to 2.7%, supported  
by favourable expected credit losses, and 
capital released to HSBC Holdings. 
However, significant improvement is 
required to achieve our 2020 targeted 
outcome of greater than 6% RoTE in the US. 
Investments in our platforms and products 
are supporting organic growth. Our active 
customer base in RBWM increased by 
nearly 200,000 to 1.3 million people. We 
grew CMB revenue by 7% and transaction 
banking revenue in GB&M by 9%.
Strategic priority 5: To enhance returns for 
our shareholders, we have committed to 
improving our capital efficiency. In 2018, 
our revenue over risk-weighted assets 
(‘RWAs’) ratio grew by 0.3 percentage 
points to 6.2%, driven by broad-based 
revenue growth across our four global 
businesses. We continue to redeploy 
RWAs to higher-return businesses.
Putting the customer at the centre
Strategic priority 6: We aim to create  
the capacity to invest in growth and 
technology through a combination of  
cost discipline and revenue growth. We 
did not achieve our target of positive 
adjusted jaws in 2018, in part due to 
unexpected market volatility in the last 
two months of the year, which impacted 
revenue. However, we remain committed 
to the discipline of positive adjusted jaws. 
Our revenue growth helped support 
$4.1bn in investment for business growth, 
productivity, regulatory and mandatory 
purposes. We are already seeing results, 
with approximately 45% of retail 
customers now digitally active and  
more than 30% of sales through digital 
channels9. In CMB, we halved the 
onboarding time to an average of  
11 days for clients.
Strategic priority 7: We exist, at our  
core, to serve our customers and we 
made a commitment in June 2018 to 
improve customer service in our eight 
‘scale markets’10. We are measuring  
our performance against customer 
satisfaction indices. In 2018, six markets  
in RBWM and three markets in CMB 
sustained a top-three rank and/or 
improved by two ranks in customer 
satisfaction.
Empower our people
Strategic priority 8: We have committed  
to simplifying the organisation and 
investing in the future skills of our 
employees. We continue to improve our 
employee engagement, as reflected in the 
improvement of our employee advocacy  
by two percentage points to 66%. Our 
ESG rating is derived from the impact we 
have on our wider stakeholders. We are 
currently rated an ‘Average performer’, 
and we are driving several initiatives  
to achieve an ‘Outperformer’ rating. 
Information on how we are empowering 
our people can be found in the ‘How we 
do business’ section on pages 22 to 29, 
with additional details in our ESG Update 
in April 2019.

Strategic Report
Financial overview
Reported results
This table shows our reported results for 
the last three years ended 31 December 
2018, 2017 and 2016.
HSBC adopted the requirements  
of IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ on  
1 January 2018, with the exception of  
the provisions relating to the presentation 
of gains and losses on financial liabilities 
designated at fair value, which were 
adopted on 1 January 2017.
Under IFRS 9, the recognition and 
measurement of expected credit losses 
differs from the approach under IAS 39. 
The change in expected credit losses 
relating to financial assets under IFRS 9 is 
recorded in the income statement under 
‘change in expected credit losses and 
other credit impairment charges’ (‘ECL’). 
As prior periods have not been restated, 
changes in impairment of financial assets 
in the comparative periods remain in 
accordance with IAS 39 and are 
recorded in the income statement under 
‘loan impairment charges and other 
credit risk provisions’ (‘LICs’) and are 
therefore not necessarily comparable  
to ECL recorded for the current period. 
All commentary in this financial overview 
compares the 2018 results with 2017, 
unless otherwise stated. 
Reported profit before tax 
Reported profit before tax of $19.9bn was 
$2.7bn or 16% higher, mainly reflecting 
growth in revenue. Operating expenses 
fell by $0.2bn, as increases, mainly 
associated with investments to grow the 
business, were more than offset by a net 
favourable movement in significant items, 
which included the non-recurrence of our 
costs to achieve programme.
Reported profit before tax included a net 
favourable movement of significant items 
of $2.1bn, which is described in more detail 
on page 34. Excluding these items and  
a favourable effect of foreign currency 
translation differences of $0.1bn, profit 
before tax increased by $0.6bn or 3%.
Reported revenue
Reported revenue of $53.8bn was 
$2.3bn or 5% higher, which reflected 
revenue growth in all global businesses, 
although revenue fell in Corporate 
Centre. The increase in reported revenue 
included a favourable effect of foreign

currency translation differences of 
$0.1bn, broadly offset by a net adverse 
movement in significant items of $0.1bn.
Significant items included: 
 – a net loss on disposals, acquisitions and 
investment in new businesses of $0.1bn 
in 2018, compared with a net gain of 
$0.3bn in 2017.
This was partly offset by:
 – a net release of provisions related to 
customer redress programmes in the 
UK of $0.1bn in 2018, compared with 
net charges of $0.1bn in 2017; and
 – lower adverse fair value movements  
on financial instruments (up $0.1bn).
Excluding significant items and foreign 
currency translation differences, revenue 
increased by $2.3bn or 4%.
Reported ECL/LICs
movement in significant items of $2.1bn. 
Significant items included:
 – the non-recurrence of costs to achieve, 
which were $3.0bn in 2017; and
 – customer redress programme costs of 
$0.1bn in 2018, compared with $0.7bn 
in 2017.
These were partly offset by:
 – settlements and provisions in 
connection with legal and regulatory 
matters of $0.8bn in 2018. This 
compared with a net release of  
$0.2bn in 2017;
 – a provision in relation to past service 
costs of guaranteed minimum pension 
benefits equalisation of $0.2bn in  
2018; and
 – the non-recurrence of gains on  
the partial settlement of pension 
obligations of $0.2bn in 2017.
In 2018, reported ECL of $1.8bn related 
mainly to RBWM ($1.2bn), notably in 
Mexico, the UK and Asia, as well as  
CMB ($0.7bn).
Excluding significant items and adverse 
foreign currency translation differences 
of $0.1bn, operating expenses increased 
by $1.8bn or 6%.
In 2017, reported LICs were $1.8bn, 
notably in RBWM ($1.0bn) as well as  
in CMB ($0.5bn) and GB&M ($0.5bn). 
This was partly offset by net releases  
in Corporate Centre of $0.2bn.
Foreign currency translation differences 
between the periods were $0.1bn 
favourable.
Reported operating expenses
Reported operating expenses of $34.7bn 
were $0.2bn or 1% lower, as an increase 
in operating expenses from near- and 
medium-term investments to grow  
the business, together with higher 
performance-related pay, were more 
than offset by a net favourable 
Reported share of profit in 
associates and joint ventures
Reported share of profit in associates  
of $2.5bn was $0.2bn or 7% higher, 
primarily reflecting an increase in income 
from Bank of Communications Co., 
Limited (‘BoCom’). 
Excluding the favourable effect of foreign 
currency translation differences of $41m, 
share of profit in associates increased  
by $0.1bn.
Dividends
On 19 February 2019, the Board 
announced a fourth interim dividend  
of $0.21 per ordinary share.
