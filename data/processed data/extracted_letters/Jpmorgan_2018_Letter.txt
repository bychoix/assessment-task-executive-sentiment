Dear Fellow Shareholders,
Jamie Dimon,  
Chairman and  
Chief Executive Officer
Once again, I begin this annual letter to shareholders with a sense of pride about 
our company and our hundreds of thousands of employees around the world. As I 
look back on the last decade — a period of profound political and economic change 
— it is remarkable how much we have accomplished, not only in terms of financial 
performance but in our steadfast dedication to help clients, communities and 
countries all around the world. 
In 2018, we continued to accelerate investments in products, services and 
technology. For example, for the first time in nearly a decade, we extended our 
presence in several states with new Chase branches (we plan to open another 400 
new branches in the next few years). In addition, we started a new digital investing 
platform: You Invest; we launched our partnership with Amazon and Berkshire 
Hathaway in healthcare; we broadened our commitment to create opportunities 
for jobs and prosperity and reduce the wealth gap for black Americans with 
Advancing Black Pathways (announced in February 2019); and we launched our 
2

--- Page 5 ---
AdvancingCities initiative to support job and wage growth in communities most 
in need of capital. While it is too soon to assess the impact of these efforts, we’re 
seeing terrific results so far.
2018 was another strong year for JPMorgan Chase, with the firm generating record 
revenue and net income, even without the impact of tax reform. We earned  
$32.5 billion in net income on revenue1 of $111.5 billion, reflecting strong underlying 
performance across our businesses. Adjusting for the enactment of the Tax Cuts 
and Jobs Act, we now have delivered record results in eight of the last nine years, 
and we have confidence that we will continue to deliver in the future. Each line 
of business grew revenue and net income for the year while continuing to make 
significant investments in products, people and technology. We grew core loans 
by 7%, increased deposits in total by 3% and generally grew market share across 
our businesses, all while maintaining credit discipline and a fortress balance 
sheet. In total, we extended credit and raised capital of $2.5 trillion for businesses, 
institutional clients and U.S. customers.
In last year’s letter, we emphasized how important a competitive global tax system 
is for America. Over the last 20 years, as the world reduced its tax rates, America 
did not. Our previous tax code was increasingly uncompetitive, overly complex, and 
loaded with special interest provisions that created winners and losers. This drove 
down capital investment in the United States, which reduced domestic productivity 
and wage growth. The new tax code establishes a business tax rate that will 
make the United States competitive around the world and frees U.S. companies 
to bring back profits earned overseas. The cumulative effect of capital retained 
and reinvested over many years in the United States will help cultivate strong 
businesses and ultimately create jobs and increase wages. 
For JPMorgan Chase, all things being equal (which they are not), the new lower 
tax rates added $3.7 billion to net income. For the long term, we expect that 
some or eventually most of that increase will be erased as companies compete 
for customers on products, capabilities and prices. However, we did take this 
opportunity in the short term to massively increase our investments in technology, 
new branches and bankers, salaries (we now pay a minimum of $31,000 a year 
for full time entry-level jobs in the United States), philanthropy and lending 
(specifically in lower income neighborhoods).

As you know, we believe tangible book value per share is a good measure of the 
value we have created for our shareholders. If our asset and liability values are 
appropriate — and we believe they are — and if we can continue to deploy this 
capital profitably, we think we can continue to exceed 15% return on tangible 
equity for the next several years (and potentially at or above 17% in the near term), 
assuming there is not a significant downturn. If we can earn these types of returns, 
our company should ultimately be worth considerably more than tangible book 
value. The chart on the bottom of the opposite page shows that tangible book value 
“anchors” the stock price.

Tangible book value over time captures the company’s use of capital, balance sheet and profitability. In this chart, we are looking at 
heritage Bank One shareholders and JPMorgan Chase & Co. shareholders. The chart shows the increase in tangible book value per share;  
it is an after-tax number that assumes all dividends were retained vs. the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (S&P 500 Index), which is a  
pre-tax number that includes reinvested dividends.
1 On March 27, 2000, Jamie Dimon was hired as CEO of Bank One.
In the last five years, we have bought back almost $55 billion in stock or 
approximately 660 million shares, which is nearly 20% of the company’s common 
shares outstanding. In prior letters, I explained why buying back our stock at 
tangible book value per share was a no-brainer. Seven years ago, we offered an 
example of this: If we bought back a large block of stock at tangible book value, 
earnings and tangible book value per share would be substantially higher just four 
years later than without the buyback. While we prefer buying back our stock at 
tangible book value, we think it makes sense to do so even at or above two times 
tangible book value for reasons similar to those we’ve expressed in the past. If we 
buy back a big block of stock this year, we would expect (using analysts’ earnings 
5

--- Page 8 ---
estimates) earnings per share in five years to be 2%–3% higher and tangible book 
value to be virtually unchanged. We want to remind our shareholders that we much 
prefer to use our capital to grow than to buy back stock. I discuss stock buybacks 
later in this letter.

1 On March 27, 2000, Jamie Dimon was hired as CEO of Bank One.
While we don’t run the company worrying about the stock price in the short run, in 
the long run our stock price is a measure of the progress we have made over the 
years. This progress is a function of continual investments, in good and bad times, 
to build our capabilities — our people, systems and products. These important 
investments drive the future prospects of our company and position it to grow 
and prosper for decades. Whether looking back over five years, 10 years or since 
the JPMorgan Chase/Bank One merger (approximately 14 years ago), our stock 
has significantly outperformed the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and the Standard 
& Poor’s Financials Index. And this growth came during a time of unprecedented 
challenges for banks — both the Great Recession and the extraordinarily difficult 
legal, regulatory and political environment that followed.

JPMorgan Chase stock is owned by large institutions, pension plans, mutual funds 
and directly by individual investors. However, it is important to remember that 
in almost all cases, the ultimate beneficiaries are individuals in our communities. 
Well over 100 million people in the United States own stock, and a large 
percentage of these individuals, in one way or another, own JPMorgan Chase 
stock. Many of these people are veterans, teachers, police officers, firefighters, 
retirees, or those saving for a home, school or retirement. Your management 
team goes to work every day recognizing the enormous responsibility that we 
have to perform for our shareholders. 
In the first section of this letter, I try to give a comprehensive understanding of 
how we run our company, including how we think about building shareholder 
value for the long run. In that section, I highlight our strong belief that building 
shareholder value can only be done in conjunction with taking care of employees, 
customers and communities. This is completely different from the commentary 
often expressed about the sweeping ills of naked capitalism and institutions only 
caring about shareholder value.
In the second section of this letter, I comment on important forward-looking issues. 
While we remain optimistic about the long-term growth of the United States and 
the world, the near-term economic and political backdrop is increasingly complex 
and fraught with risks — both known and unknown. And we face a future with less 
overall confidence in virtually all institutions, from corporations to governments 
to the media. The extremely volatile global markets in the fourth quarter of 2018 
might be a harbinger of things to come — creating both risks for our company and 
opportunities to serve our clients. 
The third section of this letter is about public policy, specifically American public 
policy, which is a major concern for our country and, therefore, our company. 
Again, I try to give a comprehensive, multi-year overview of what I see as some of 
our problems and suggest a few ways they can be addressed. One consistent theme 
is completely clear: Businesses, governments and communities need to work as 
partners, collaboratively and constructively, to analyze and solve problems and 
help strengthen the economy for everyone’s benefit.

4.  We lift up our communities.
5.  We take care of our employees.
6.  We always strive to learn more about management and leadership. 
7.  We do not worry about some issues.

1.  We need to continue to restore trust in the strength of the U.S. banking system 
and global systemically important financial institutions.
2.  We have to remind ourselves that responsible banking is good and safe banking.
3.  We believe in good regulation — both to help America grow and improve 
financial stability.
4.  We believe stock buybacks are an essential part of proper capital allocation  
but secondary to long-term investing. 
5.  On the importance of the cloud and artificial intelligence, we are all in.
6.  We remain devoted and diligent to protect privacy and stay cyber safe —  
we will do what it takes.
7.  We know there are risks on the horizon that will eventually demand

III.  Public Policy
1. 
The American Dream is alive — but fraying for many.
2.  We must have a proper diagnosis of our problems — the issues are real  
and serious — if we want to have the proper prescription that leads to  
workable solutions.
3.  All these issues are fixable, but that will happen only if we set aside partisan 
politics and narrow self-interest — our country must come first.
4.  Governments must be better and more effective — we cannot succeed without 
their help. The rest of us could do a better job, too.
5.  CEOs: Your country needs you!
6.  America’s global role and engagement are indispensable.

JPM ORG AN  CHAS E PR INCIPLES AND STRATEGIES
In this section, I want to give the reader a comprehensive view of how we run the company. 
We manage the company consistently with these principles in mind – and they have stood 
the test of time. We also strive to satisfy, and even exceed, the requirements of our regu-
lators and governments around the globe – and we think these principles are a critical 
component of that.
1.  First and foremost, we look at our business from the point of view of the customer.
Customer needs are what gets our attention. 
We believe that in a hyper-competitive world 
(from competitors known and unknown), the 
best strategy – both offensive and defensive 
– is to give the customer more: something 
better, faster or more efficiently. We are 
always on a quest to improve our products 
and services, and, for the most part, this is 
done with enhancements in technology and 
through the continual training of our people. 
Most fundamental of all is doing the right 
thing for our customers – in all cases. 
We energetically drive organic growth.
We continue to drive good and healthy 
organic growth (meaning good customers, 
products and services they need and want 
at fair and reasonable prices), and while 
we are happy with our progress, we recog-
nize that we won’t meet every goal we set 
for ourselves and can always do better. In 
past letters, we have identified many areas 
of organic growth. Our achievements with 
these initiatives are detailed in the CEO 
letters in this Annual Report, but a few of 
the critical strategies are highlighted in the 
sidebar below.
ORGANIC GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES ACROSS OUR LINES OF BUSINESS
Consumer & 
Community 
Banking
•  By 2022, we expect 93% of the U.S. population to be in our Chase footprint 
as we expand our branch network to new markets with an integrated 
physical and digital approach. In addition to entering the Washington, D.C., 
Philadelphia and Boston markets in 2018, we recently announced nine new 
markets for 2019, including Charlotte, Minneapolis, Nashville and St. Louis. 
•  The onboarding experience for new customers is being simplified. 
Customers can open a new deposit account digitally in three to five minutes, 
functionality that added approximately 1.5 million new accounts since its 
February 2018 launch; we’re expanding this functionality inside our 
branches as well. We also recently announced Chase MyHome, our new 
digitally enabled mortgage fulfillment process that prefills applications for 
our existing customers. It’s 20% faster than our paper-based process, 
allowing us to close a mortgage within three weeks. Our confidence in our 
enhanced approach is reflected in our money-back guarantee.
10

--- Page 13 ---
•  Customers recently began receiving personalized merchant offers and 
discounts from ChaseOffersSM. This program ramped up rapidly, with 
customers activating 25+ million offers across 7 million cards in the initiative’s 
first three months. CreditJourneySM, with more than 15 million users enrolled, 
has also been a tremendously successful way to engage customers through 
access to credit score information and identity protection. 
•  And later this year, we’ll make it easier for our credit card customers to 
borrow on their existing lines through two new products — My Chase PlanSM, 
allowing customers to finance a specific purchase at a reasonable cost at 
the point of sale; and My Chase LoanSM, letting customers borrow against 
their unused credit limit and pay back their debt in fixed amounts at a 
competitive rate. These products enable us to compete for the approximately 
$250 billion in card loans that our existing customers have with competitors. 
Corporate &  
Investment Bank
•  We have been #1 in investment banking for the past decade and finished 
2018 with 8.7% of global wallet share, the industry’s best. Still, we believe 
we can increase our share over time as we continue to add bankers 
selectively and leverage technology to provide better data and insights  
to our clients. 
•  Our Treasury Services business grew revenue by 13% last year. As we 
further implement our wholesale payments model, which includes merchant 
services, we will be able to deliver a unique value proposition to our clients. 
We see opportunities in every customer segment from middle market and 
small businesses to large corporate clients and their business outside of  
the United States. 
•  We have consistently grown share in Markets — including in businesses 
where the wallet has shrunk. We are prioritizing investments in products 
and technology to stay ahead of our clients’ needs. As companies expand 
their businesses and acquire assets — increasingly across borders — our 
global expertise in hedging risks and protecting capital can be as important 
to them as the actual acquisition. 
•  Our Securities Services business has transformed itself into an industry 
powerhouse, and it sits alongside the world’s leading trading businesses. As 
asset managers face ongoing pressures from passive investing and margin 
compression in the coming years, we think we have a unique opportunity to 
help them become more efficient by outsourcing support functions and 
using our innovative technology platforms. 
•  Our Corporate & Investment Bank is one of the few truly global businesses 
in the financial services industry. As emerging countries take their place on 
the global stage, we will be there to support them. The investments we are 
making in China and in other emerging markets today will result in our 
international growth for years to come.
