Dear Fellow Shareholders,
Jamie Dimon, 
Chairman and 
Chief Executive 
Officer
Across the globe, 2023 was yet another year of significant challenges, from the 
terrible ongoing wars and violence in the Middle East and Ukraine to mounting 
terrorist activity and growing geopolitical tensions, importantly with China. Almost 
all nations felt the effects last year of global economic uncertainty, including higher 
energy and food prices, inflation rates and volatile markets. While all these events 
and associated instability have serious ramifications on our company, colleagues, 
clients and countries where we do business, their consequences on the world at large 
— with the extreme suffering of the Ukrainian people, escalating tragedy in the Middle 
East and the potential restructuring of the global order — are far more important. 
As these events unfold, America’s global leadership role is being challenged outside 
by other nations and inside by our polarized electorate. We need to find ways to put 
aside our differences and work in partnership with other Western nations in the name 
of democracy. During this time of great crises, uniting to protect our essential 
freedoms, including free enterprise, is paramount. We should remember that 
America, “conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are 
2

created equal,” still remains a shining beacon of hope to citizens around the world. 
JPMorgan Chase, a company that historically has worked across borders and 
boundaries, will do its part to ensure that the global economy is safe and secure. 
In spite of the unsettling landscape, including last year’s regional bank turmoil, the 
U.S. economy continues to be resilient, with consumers still spending, and the 
markets currently expect a soft landing. It is important to note that the economy is 
being fueled by large amounts of government deficit spending and past stimulus. 
There is also a growing need for increased spending as we continue transitioning to  
a greener economy, restructuring global supply chains, boosting military expenditure 
and battling rising healthcare costs. This may lead to stickier inflation and higher 
rates than markets expect. Furthermore, there are downside risks to watch. 
Quantitative tightening is draining more than $900 billion in liquidity from the system 
annually — and we have never truly experienced the full effect of quantitative 
tightening on this scale. Plus the ongoing wars in Ukraine and the Middle East 
continue to have the potential to disrupt energy and food markets, migration, and 
military and economic relationships, in addition to their dreadful human cost. These 
significant and somewhat unprecedented forces cause us to remain cautious. 
2023 was another strong year for JPMorgan Chase, with our firm generating record 
revenue for the sixth consecutive year, as well as setting numerous records in each  
of our lines of business. We earned revenue in 2023 of $162.4 billion1 and net income 
of $49.6 billion, with return on tangible common equity (ROTCE) of 21%, reflecting 
strong underlying performance across our businesses. We also increased our 
quarterly common dividend of $1.00 per share to $1.05 per share in the third quarter 
of 2023 — and again to $1.15 per share in the first quarter of 2024 — while continuing 
to reinforce our fortress balance sheet. We grew market share in several of our 
businesses and continued to make significant investments in products, people and 
technology while exercising strict risk disciplines. 
Throughout the year, we demonstrated the power of our investment philosophy and 
guiding principles, as well as the value of being there for clients — as we always are — 
in both good times and bad times. The result was continued growth broadly across 
the firm. We will highlight a few examples from 2023: Consumer & Community 
Banking (CCB) extended its #1 leadership positions and grew share year-over-year in 
retail deposits, credit card sales and credit card outstandings (adding close to 3.6 
million net new customers to the franchise); the Corporate & Investment Bank (CIB) 
1   Represents managed revenue.

maintained its #1 rank in both Investment Banking and Markets and gained more 
than 100 basis points of Investment Banking market share; Commercial Banking (CB) 
added over 5,000 new relationships (excluding First Republic Bank), roughly doubling 
the prior year’s achievement; and Asset & Wealth Management (AWM) saw record 
client asset net inflows of $490 billion, over 20% higher than its prior record.
In 2023, we continued to play a forceful and essential role in advancing economic 
growth. In total, we extended credit and raised capital totaling $2.3 trillion for our 
consumer and institutional clients around the world. On a daily basis, we move nearly 
$10 trillion in over 120 currencies and more than 160 countries, as well as safeguard 
over $32 trillion in assets. By purchasing First Republic Bank, we brought much-
needed stability to the U.S. banking system while allowing us to give a new, secure 
home to over half a million First Republic customers.
As always, we hold fast to our commitment to corporate responsibility, including 
helping to create a stronger, more inclusive economy — from supporting work skills 
training programs around the world to financing affordable housing and small 
businesses to making investments in cities like Detroit that show how business and 
government leaders can work together to solve problems. 
We have achieved our decades-long consistency by adhering to our key principles and 
strategies (see sidebar on Steadfast Principles on page 5), which allow us to drive 
good organic growth and promote proper management of our capital (including 
dividends and stock buybacks). The charts on pages 9–15 show our performance 
results and illustrate how we have grown our franchises, how we compare with our 
competitors and how we look at our fortress balance sheet. Please peruse them and 
the CEO letters in this Annual Report, all of which provide specific details about our 
businesses and our plans for the future. 
I remain proud of our company’s resiliency and of what our hundreds of thousands of 
employees around the world have achieved, collectively and individually. Throughout 
these challenging past few years, we have never stopped doing all the things we should 
be doing to serve our clients and our communities. As you know, we are champions of 
banking’s essential role in a community — its potential for bringing people together, for 
enabling companies and individuals to attain their goals, and for being a source of 
strength in difficult times. I often remind our employees that the work we do matters 
4

STEADFAST PRINCIPLES WORTH REPEATING (AND ONE NEW ONE)
Looking back on the past two+ decades — 
starting from my time as Chairman and 
CEO of Bank One in 2000 — there is one 
common theme: our unwavering dedica-
tion to help clients, communities and 
countries throughout the world. It is clear 
that our financial discipline, constant 
investment in innovation and ongoing 
development of our people have enabled 
us to achieve this consistency and com-
mitment. In addition, across the firm, we 
uphold certain steadfast tenets that are 
worth repeating. 
First, our work has very real human 
impact. While JPMorgan Chase stock is 
owned by large institutions, pension 
plans, mutual funds and directly by single 
investors, in almost all cases the ultimate 
beneficiaries are individuals in our com-
munities. More than 100 million people in 
the United States own stocks; many, in 
one way or another, own JPMorgan Chase 
stock. Frequently, these shareholders are 
veterans, teachers, police officers, fire-
fighters, healthcare workers, retirees, or 
those saving for a home, education or 
retirement. Often, our employees also 
bank these shareholders, as well as their 
families and their companies. Your man-
agement team goes to work every day 
recognizing the enormous responsibility 
that we have to all of our shareholders. 
Second, shareholder value can be built 
only if you maintain a healthy and vibrant 
company, which means doing a good job 
of taking care of your customers, employ-
ees and communities. Conversely, how 
can you have a healthy company if you 
neglect any of these stakeholders? As we 
have learned over the past few years, 
there are myriad ways an institution can 
demonstrate its compassion for its 
employees and its communities while still 
strengthening shareholder value.
Third, while we don’t run the company 
worrying about the stock price in the short 
run, in the long run we consider our stock 
price a measure of our progress over time. 
This progress is a function of continual 
investments in our people, systems and 
products, in good and bad times, to build 
our capabilities. These important invest-
ments will also drive our company’s future 
prospects and position it to grow and 
prosper for decades. Measured by stock 
performance, our progress is exceptional. 
For example, whether looking back 10 
years or even farther to 2004, when the 
JPMorgan Chase/Bank One merger took 
place, we have outperformed the Standard 
& Poor’s 500 Index and the Standard & 
Poor’s Financials Index. 
Fourth, we are united behind basic princi-
ples and strategies (you can see the prin-
ciples for How We Do Business on our 
website and our Purpose statement in my 
letter from last year) that have helped 
build this company and made it thrive. 
These allow us to maintain a fortress bal-
ance sheet, constantly invest and nurture 
talent, fully satisfy regulators, continually 
improve risk, governance and controls, 
and serve customers and clients while 
lifting up communities worldwide. This 
philosophy is embedded in our company 
culture and influences nearly every role 
in the firm. 
Fifth, we strive to build enduring busi-
nesses, which rely on and benefit from one 
another, but we are not a conglomerate. 
This structure helps generate our superior 
returns. Nonetheless, despite our best 
efforts, the walls that protect this com-
pany are not particularly high — and we 
face extraordinary competition. I have 
written about this reality extensively in the 
past and cover it again in this letter. We 
recognize our strengths and vulnerabili-
ties, and we play our hand as best we can.
Sixth, and this is the new one, we must be 
a source of strength, particularly in tough 
times, for our clients and the countries in 
which we operate. We must take seriously 
our role as one of the guardians of the 
world’s financial systems.
Seventh, we operate with a very important 
silent partner — the U.S. government — 
noting as my friend Warren Buffett points 
out that his company’s success is predi-
cated upon the extraordinary conditions 
our country creates. He is right to say to 
his shareholders that when they see the 
American flag, they all should say thank 
you. We should, too. JPMorgan Chase is a 
healthy and thriving company, and we 
always want to give back and pay our fair 
share. We do pay our fair share — and we 
want it to be spent well and have the 
greatest impact. To give you an idea of 
where our taxes and fees go: In the last 10 
years, we paid more than $46 billion in 
federal, state and local taxes in the United 
States and over $22 billion in taxes outside 
of the United States. Additionally, we paid 
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 
over $10 billion so that it has the resources 
to cover failure in the American banking 
sector. Our partner — the federal govern-
ment — also imposes significant regula-
tions upon us, and it is imperative that we 
meet all legal and regulatory require-
ments imposed on our company. 
Eighth and finally, we know the founda-
tion of our success rests with our people. 
They are the front line, both individually 
and as teams, serving our customers and 
communities, building the technology, 
making the strategic decisions, managing 
the risks, determining our investments 
and driving innovation. However you view 
the world — its complexity, risks and 
opportunities — a company’s prosperity 
requires a great team of people with 
guts, brains, integrity, enormous capabili-
ties and high standards of professional 
excellence to ensure its ongoing success.

and has impact. United by our principles and purpose, we help people and institutions 
finance and achieve their aspirations, lifting up individuals, homeowners, small 
businesses, larger corporations, schools, hospitals, cities and countries in all regions  
of the world. What we have accomplished in the 20 years since the Bank One and 
JPMorgan Chase merger is evidence of the importance of our values.
CELEBRATING THE 20TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE BANK ONE/JPMORGAN CHASE 
MERGER
J.P. Morgan Chase
By 2004, J.P. Morgan Chase already represented the consolidation of four of the 10 
largest U.S. banks from 1990: The Chase Manhattan Corp., Manufacturers Hanover, 
Chemical Banking Corp. and, most recently, J.P. Morgan & Company. And some of their 
predecessor companies stretched back into the 1800s, one even into the late 1700s.
Bank One
Bank One had been even busier on the acquisition front, especially across the United 
States. By 1998, then Banc One had more than 1,300 branches in 12 states when it 
announced a merger with First Chicago NBD, a Chicago-based bank created just  
three years earlier by the merger of First Chicago and Detroit-based NBD. Now 
headquartered in Chicago, the new Bank One became the largest bank in the 
Midwest, second largest among credit card companies and fourth largest in the 
United States. But the merger didn’t go as planned, with Bank One issuing three 
different earnings warnings. In March 2000, Bank One reached outside its executive 
ranks, and my tenure began as Chairman and CEO, working to overhaul the company 
and help bring it back to profitability and growth. 
The story begins ... A merger 20 years ago helped transform two giant banks
Fast forward to 2003, and another wave of consolidation was well underway in U.S. 
banking. Most of the nation’s larger banks were trying to position themselves to be an 
“endgame winner.” In the biggest deal, Bank of America agreed to buy FleetBoston 
Financial Corp. for more than $40 billion. Those two banks — already amalgamations 
of several predecessor companies — touted the breadth of their combined retail 
branch network.
7

--- Page 10 ---
But they were hardly alone. In 2003, some 215 deals were announced among  
U.S. commercial banks and bank holding companies for a total value of $66 billion, 
according to Thomson Financial, which tracks merger data.
In July 2004, J.P. Morgan Chase and Bank One merged — as part of a 225-year 
journey — to form this exceptional company of ours: JPMorgan Chase. At its merger  
in 2004, the combined bank was the fourth largest bank in the world by market 
capitalization. But with patient groundwork over the years — fixing systems and 
upgrading technology, managing the notable acquisitions of Bear Stearns and 
Washington Mutual (WaMu) and continuing to reinvest, including in our talent —  
we have made our company an endgame winner. 
In earlier years, banks worried about their survival. While the past two decades have 
brought some virtually unprecedented challenges, including the great financial crisis 
and a pandemic followed by a global shutdown, they did not stop us from 
accomplishing extraordinary things. Our bank has now emerged as the #1 bank by 
market capitalization. 
Each of our businesses is among the best in the world, with increased market share, 
strong financial results and an unwavering focus on serving our clients, communities 
and shareholders with distinction and dedication. The strengths that are embedded in 
JPMorgan Chase — the knowledge and cohesiveness of our people, our long-standing 
client relationships, our technology and product capabilities, our presence in more 
than 100 countries and our unquestionable fortress balance sheet — would be hard to 
replicate. Crucially, the strength of our company has allowed us to always be there for 
clients, governments and communities — in good times and in bad times — and this 
strength has enabled us to continually invest in building our businesses for the future.
You can see from the following charts what gains and improvements we have 
achieved along the way.
