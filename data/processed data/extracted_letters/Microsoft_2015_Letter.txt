Dear shareholders, customers, partners and colleagues:   
It’s been a remarkable year for all of us at Microsoft, a year of change and opportunity for our company, our industry 
and the world.  
We as a company stand for deeply understanding the needs of customers, translating that understanding into products 
that people love and ultimately into the success our customers have with our products. It’s that last part that is our key 
motivation. The entire Microsoft team is inspired to bring their best ideas and efforts every day to build products people 
love, and to advance our mission to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. 
And we’re seeing the impact.  
We  sharpened  our  focus  this  past  fiscal  year,  prioritizing  our  talent  and  investments  in  areas  where  we  have 
differentiation and potential for growth. We executed with financial discipline, with revenue of $93.6 billion, $60.5 billion 
of gross margin, $18.2 billion in operating income and $12.2 billion in net income. And we significantly increased our 
total cash return to shareholders by nearly 50 percent to $23.3 billion.  
We  also  made  key  decisions  that  are  moving  us  forward  as  the  company  that  builds  best-in-class  platforms  and 
productivity services for our mobile-first, cloud-first world.  
•   We launched Windows 10 as a service that unites your experience across a wide range of devices with 
innovations that increase productivity and flexibility while remaining familiar.   
•   Surface  is proving that consumers  and  businesses alike want a  tablet  that can replace their laptop. We 
achieved $3.6 billion in Surface revenue  – equally gratifying is the fact that Surface won fans while also 
creating a new hardware category.  
•  We restructured our phone business, as we aligned our first-party hardware portfolio into the larger Windows 
ecosystem.  Going  forward  we  will  focus  on  building  premium,  flagship  phones  for  Windows  fans  and 
commercial customers.  
•  We delivered Office everywhere on all devices, and Office 365 consumer subscriptions grew to more than 
15 million,  adding  nearly  10 million  subscribers  in  the  fiscal  year.  Commercial  customers  are  rapidly 
adopting this service with seats growing by 74 percent.   
•   Azure cloud platform revenue and compute usage increased by over 100 percent in the fourth quarter year 
over year.  
•   We are gaining ground in business process applications with triple-digit growth of the Dynamics CRM Online 
installed base and the overall Dynamics business growing revenue by double digits.   
•   We delivered innovative new cloud services at an increasing pace spanning enterprise mobility, big data, 
cloud infrastructure and application developer services.   
In  this  year’s  letter,  I  want  to  look  forward  and  paint  a  picture  of  how  we’re  building  on  this  momentum  while  also 
reflecting on what we’ve learned.

Empowerment.  Microsoft,  since  its  founding,  has  stood  for  individual  and  organizational  empowerment.  What’s 
different about our company when compared with the  industry  is that we make things that  help other people make 
things.  We  also  help  them  make  things  happen.  We  are  well  poised  to  ignite  a  new  revolution  in  which  digital 
technologies  democratize  access  to  people  across  economic  strata,  organizations  of  all  sizes,  entrepreneurs, 
researchers  and  students  everywhere.  This  is  empowerment.  To  deliver  on  this  promise  of  empowerment,  we’ve 
galvanized around three interconnected ambitions that will, in turn, drive our segment financial reporting this fiscal year.   
1)  Reinvent  productivity  and  business  processes.  We  are  helping  customers  be  even  more  effective  with  their 
individual time, while bringing together the power of teams and entire organizations to drive business outcomes and 
success. Time is quickly becoming our scarcest commodity, and people and organizations need the right tools and 
services that help them achieve increasingly complex and challenging outcomes more quickly than ever.   
We are building an array of productivity, communications, collaboration and business process applications so that they 
are optimized for what our users want to achieve rather than being bound to any current product category definitions. 
We let  you pick  up any device and create, collaborate,  communicate or do  business  using our cloud  services.  We 
enable you to complete your sales order by connecting seamlessly to CRM data within Outlook. We enable you to co-
author in real time a student paper with a classmate or an RFP response with colleagues across your organization. 
We empower transparent communications and discovery of enterprise knowledge using tools such as Yammer, Delve 
and Power BI. Skype and Skype for Business enable  you to  have effective meetings with customers, partners and 
colleagues anywhere, anytime.  
Here is a case in point. London’s Metro Bank is reinventing the way banking works. Metro colleagues guide customers 
through  important  financial  decisions  using  Dynamics  CRM  Online,  Office  365,  Power  BI  and  Skype  for  Business. 
Customers like Metro are proving that we are at the dawn of a new generation, one with productivity and business 
process  systems  that  fundamentally  changes  the  nature  of  work,  and  more  importantly  drives  superior  business 
outcomes.  
Looking ahead, we’re poised for new growth given our bold ambition in this space. With Office 2016 and Office 365, 
we will continue to enrich the features and capabilities to help people create and communicate. As an example, many 
Office 365 customers will now get rich new voice capabilities with Skype for Business and other new features that have 
enabled  us to expand  our market opportunity for Office 365 by more than $50 billion.  The CRM and ERP markets 
combined are over $60 billion, and represent a massive opportunity for reinvention as they shift to the cloud and mobile 
experiences.  
2) Build the intelligent cloud platform. Microsoft is building a cloud platform that enables the world’s applications to 
become intelligent using the next-generation infrastructure, data and developer services.   
We are unique in that we are the only company building out a hyper-scale public cloud while also meeting customer 
needs for private cloud and hybrid solutions. The Azure cloud platform is now available in 140 countries with over 20 
datacenter regions, more than any other public cloud. We are the first multinational company to operate a public cloud 
in China. Even as organizations transition to the cloud, we continue to see impressive growth in our server business 
with Windows Server, System Center Server and SQL Server. Our servers are the leading edge of this intelligent cloud, 
and this is important because there are going to be many legitimate reasons for people wanting digital sovereignty. We 
believe this is the future of true distributed computing infrastructure, designed to meet the needs and complexities of 
the real world.  
Microsoft Enterprise Mobility had a breakout year, and now more than 17,000 customers are using the service. EMS 
delivers infrastructure for enterprises of all sizes to manage and secure all of their identities, applications, data and 
devices. In doing so, EMS enables a new way for organizations to work in a world where they are increasingly mobile 
and using SaaS services.

We  are  helping  transform  businesses  through  the  use  of  data.  Cortana  Analytics  Suite  provides  customers  and 
application developers with a fully managed big data and analytics suite that transforms data into intelligent action. 
These capabilities are being used by customers across the full spectrum of industries throughout the economy. And 
we are capitalizing on the advent of the Internet of Things and the associated changes in business models that require 
increasingly advanced cloud data and analytics capabilities.   
We made tremendous progress in our developer engagement this past year by delivering new innovative services to 
developers across all device platforms and also opening our technology to create more participation from open source 
communities. Visual Studio Online now provides a leading set of services for modern development.   
I am excited about the growth opportunities ahead. We’ve broadened our addressable market by building and acquiring 
technologies in key growth categories like security, data and analytics, while also delivering greater integration and 
support for Linux and open source technologies such as Docker containers and Hadoop. Security is a key priority for 
our enterprise customers and represents a $30 billion market opportunity. Likewise, business intelligence and analytics 
is another rapidly growing market for us with an opportunity of more than $15 billion. We are expanding our datacenter 
presence  to  India  and  Canada,  and  will  evaluate  future  expansion  opportunities  as  well. We  also  have  major  new 
releases planned across Windows Server and SQL Server in the coming year that will provide continued opportunity 
for growth and include innovations developed in our public cloud to empower customers’ IT and developer teams to 
achieve more.  
3) Create more personal computing. Our ambition is to make your Windows experience, whether at home or at work, 
more natural, more mobile, and more trusted. Whether using our devices for productivity, gaming, browsing or anything 
else, we want to move customers from needing, to choosing, to loving Windows.   
With the launch of Windows 10, we’re just at the start of a new era of computing that’s more personal, focused on the 
mobility of human experiences across devices. Innovations such as Continuum on Lumia phones running Windows 
10,  for  example,  enable  you  to  simply  take  your  phone  and  attach  it  to  a  screen  and  keyboard  providing  robust 
productivity experiences so your phone can function as a laptop. Windows 10 is more personal and more productive 
with Cortana, Office and universal apps. Windows 10 is delivering truly breakthrough new experiences, like inking on 
our new browser, Microsoft Edge, and gaming across Xbox and PCs. It also opens up entirely new device categories 
such as HoloLens. Security and trust are essential. Windows 10 is safe, secure and always up to date. And it provides 
a single device management platform across all devices, from phones, to laptops, to Internet of Things devices.  
We’re excited and appreciative to see the enthusiastic response to Windows 10 with more than 110 million devices 
already active with the latest Windows.  
Going forward, I believe we will broaden our economic opportunity and return Windows to growth. This holiday, we will 
see the widest range ever of Windows devices, including hundreds of new hardware designs from our partners. With 
Surface, our vision that customers would want a tablet that can replace a laptop has added to the Windows ecosystem 
and created new opportunities for our partners to innovate. We’ll also grow through monetization opportunities across 
the  commercial  and  consumer  spaces.  In  the  enterprise,  customers  will  continue  to  value  our  unparalleled 
management, security and servicing capabilities. And for consumers, Windows 10 creates monetization opportunities 
with Store, search and gaming.

New growth. With all of this new innovation hitting the market, we are on track to reach two important goals for fiscal 
year 2018: a commercial cloud revenue  annual  run rate of $20 billion and 1 billion Windows  10 active devices  per 
month.  
Our approach to growth is simple – we’ll make products and services that are differentiated in markets that are large 
and growing and pioneer new categories. We’ll continue the transition from a transactional relationship with customers 
to one that recognizes the more consistent, lifetime value of a customer. Each of our three ambitions positions Microsoft 
to increase the lifetime value of our customers and win new customers in every part of the world. We work hard to earn 
the trust you’ve shown with your investment. Our past success and ongoing execution make it possible for us to deliver 
the financial performance, strength of balance sheet and return of capital today. It’s our passion for innovation and 
ambition in rapidly growing markets is what has the potential to deliver new value long into the future.   
Culture. Simply stated, I want Microsoft to be the greatest place to work for smart people who are hungry to make a 
difference. It’s been said that culture is the widening of the mind and of the spirit. We spend far too much of our lives 
at work not to find deep meaning in what we do. The broad aperture of our mission and appetite for growth invites 
diversity in all delineations so all employees can uniquely contribute and bring their best every day. When people are 
doing what they love and pursuing a mission they believe in with a growth mindset, I know both great innovation and 
growth will happen.  
When I first started in my new role last year I told employees it was time for us to rediscover our soul – what makes us 
unique.  In  “The  Soul  of  a  New  Machine,”  author  Tracy  Kidder  shows  us  that  technology  is  nothing  more  than  the 
collective soul of those who built it. The technology is fascinating, but even more fascinating is the profound obsession 
of its designers. In the year ahead we will continue to ask ourselves what are the challenges mankind faces, how can 
technology help, and what is the contribution of Microsoft? We can clearly see that there’s a transformation underway 
in our business and renewed spirit in our hallways. We are just starting to get a glimpse of how Microsoft technology 
empowers customers to succeed and make their own difference in the world. We are eager to see what we can do in 
the year ahead to drive greater growth and greater impact in our world.

Note About Forward-Looking Statements  
This  report  includes  estimates,  projections,  statements  relating  to  our  business  plans,  objectives,  and  expected 
operating results that are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform 
Act  of  1995,  Section 27A  of  the  Securities  Act  of  1933  and  Section 21E  of  the  Securities  Exchange  Act  of  1934. 
Forward-looking  statements  may  appear  throughout  this  report,  including  the  following  sections:  “Business,” 
“Management’s  Discussion  and  Analysis,”  and  “Risk  Factors.”  These  forward-looking  statements  generally  are 
identified by the words “believe,” “project,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “intend,” “strategy,” “future,” “opportunity,” 
“plan,”  “may,” “should,” “will,” “would,”  “will  be,”  “will continue,” “will  likely result,”  and  similar expressions. Forward-
looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties that 
may cause actual results to differ materially. We describe risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and 
events to differ materially in “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis” in our fiscal year 2015 Form 
10-K. We undertake  no obligation to  update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether because of 
new information, future events, or otherwise.   
BUSINESS DESCRIPTION  
GENERAL  
Our vision  
Microsoft is a technology company whose mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet 
to achieve more. Our strategy is to build best-in-class platforms and productivity services for a mobile-first, cloud-first 
world.  
The  mobile-first,  cloud-first  world  is  transforming  the  way  individuals  and  organizations  use  and  interact  with 
technology.  Our  worldview  for  mobile-first  is  not  about  the  mobility  of  devices;  it  is  centered  on  the  mobility  of 
experiences that,  in turn, are orchestrated  by the cloud. Cloud computing  and  storage  solutions provide  users and 
enterprises with various capabilities to store and process their data in third-party data centers. Mobility encompasses 
the  rich  collection  of  data,  applications,  and  services  that  accompany  our  customers  as  they  move  from  setting  to 
setting in their lives. We are transforming our businesses to enable Microsoft to lead the direction of this transformation, 
and enable our customers and partners to thrive in this evolving world.   
What we offer  
Founded in 1975, we operate worldwide and have offices in more than 100 countries. We develop, license, and support 
a wide  range of  software products,  services, and devices that  deliver  new  opportunities, greater convenience, and 
enhanced value to  people’s lives. We offer an array of services, including cloud-based services, to consumers and 
businesses. We design, manufacture, and sell devices that integrate with our cloud-based services, and we deliver 
relevant online advertising to a global audience.  
Our products include operating systems for computing devices, servers, phones, and other intelligent devices; server 
applications  for  distributed  computing  environments;  cross-device  productivity  applications;  business  solution 
applications; desktop and server management tools; software development tools; video games; and online advertising. 
We also design and sell hardware including PCs, tablets, gaming and entertainment consoles, phones, other intelligent 
devices,  and  related  accessories.  We  offer  cloud-based  solutions  that  provide  customers  with  software,  services, 
platforms, and content. We also provide consulting and product and solution support services, and we train and certify 
computer system integrators and developers.   
The ambitions that drive us  
To carry out our strategy, our research and development efforts focus on three interconnected ambitions:   
•  Reinvent productivity and business processes.   
•  Build the intelligent cloud platform.  
•   Create more personal computing.  
Reinvent productivity and business processes  
We  believe  we  can  significantly  enhance  the  lives  of  our  customers  using  our  broad  portfolio  of  communication, 
productivity,  and  information  services  that  spans  devices  and  platforms.  Productivity  will  be  the  first  and  foremost 
objective, to enable people to meet and collaborate more easily, and to effectively express ideas in new ways. We will
