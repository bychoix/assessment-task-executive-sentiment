Making Ever-better Cars and Our Strategic 
Shift toward Electriﬁ cation, Information, 
and Intelligence Technologies
Based on the Toyota 
Global Vision, announced 
in March 2011, Toyota 
strives to implement a 
positive cycle of making 
ever-better cars that 
exceed customer expec-
tations, enriching lives of 
communities, being 
rewarded with the smiles 
of customers and commu-
nities, and thus reinforcing

its stable base of business in order to grow sustain-
ably in concert with society. As it faces the greatest 
changes to the automobile in a century, Toyota’s 
long-term strategy is to advance management based 
on its vision of the future mobility society of 2030.
  Since the birth of the automobile in the 18th centu-
ry, the mobility of people and things has increased 
dramatically. Today, it is possible to provide conve-
nient transportation to virtually anywhere at any time. 
The development of mobility has underpinned eco-
nomic growth and the development of society and 
culture. The heart of this evolution has been the 
steady improvement of vehicle performance, safety, 
and convenience.
  Now, changes driven by innovation in automated 
driving technologies that employ artiﬁ cial intelligence 
(AI), connected car technologies, robotics, and other 
areas are on the verge of linking cars, people, and 
social infrastructure in new ways, transforming indus-
try, society, and the very ways we live. 
  We believe that our customers today greatly enjoy 
car ownership—they feel attached to their cars and 
appreciate car design and the fun of driving. However, 
with environmental and resource-related problems 
growing more severe, cars are increasingly being seen 
as emblematic of pollution and the waste of energy 
and resources. 
  The technologies driving the rapid changes in the 
business environment surrounding cars, such as 
electriﬁ cation, connected systems, and AI, have the 
potential to provide never-before-seen value. They 
are also driving the provision of social value by, for 
example, helping to eliminate trafﬁ c accidents and 
environmental burden. Going forward, the costs 
associated with these technologies, such as those of 
enhancing functionality to meet needs related to 
environmental regulations, automated driving tech-
nology, and connected technologies, may signiﬁ cant-
ly impact our businesses. However, mobility services 
and connected services that utilize such technologies 
also present opportunities to create new revenue 
models. Based on this understanding, we believe 
that Toyota must now endeavor to both make ever-
better cars in order to sustain and enhance the auto-
mobile manufacturing business, its current mainstay, 
and shift to new business models for the future. 
  To make ever-better cars, we are striving to 
enhance the speciﬁ c appeal of each type of car, 
whether it be a Lexus, part of our GR sports car 
series, or a Land Cruiser, clearly deﬁ ning the role and 
key characteristics of each. By doing so, we provide 
value in the form of uniquely Toyota cars that will be 
cherished and appreciated by customers for years 
and years. At the same time, by making a strategic 
shift toward electriﬁ cation, information, and intelli-
gence to build new business models, we are 
expanding our range of business. 
In these ways, we will not only continue to evolve 
our existing car manufacturing business, but expand 
the scope of innovation to encompass social plat-
forms that meet society’s needs and technological 
platforms, such as AI, that extend beyond cars. By 
doing so, we aim to provide broad-ranging value that 
exceeds customer expectations as we work to cre-
ate the mobility society of the future. 
  There is a limit to what Toyota can do to provide 
such future value. To blaze the trail toward a new 
mobility society, we must ﬁ nd partners who share our 
aspirations and will inspire us to continue pushing 
forward while cooperating and competing with play-
ers in other industries.

Focused on the Mobility of the Future
Eco-car Strategy: Electriﬁ cation 
Toyota is exploring all available options in powertrain 
development. We believe that we can build a highly 
energy efﬁ cient mobility society by allowing govern-
ments and markets to select the cars best suited to 
regional energy and infrastructure conditions and 
allowing customers to choose the cars with the spe-
ciﬁ c characteristics best suited to their needs. 
  For the time being, the further development of 
technologies for conventional engines, which are still 
the mainstream, is a practical, highly realistic way to 
help reduce CO2 emissions. At the same time, we are 
working to develop and increase the use of fuel cell 
vehicles (FCVs), the ultimate eco-cars, and advancing 
other initiatives in coordination with diverse stakehold-
ers to realize our goal of establishing a low-carbon 
society that uses hydrogen. We are also accelerating 
the development of electric vehicles (EVs), another 
zero-emission vehicle option. To this end, we have 
established the EV Business Planning Department 
and a business and capital alliance with Mazda Motor 
Corporation, launching a new company to implement 
joint technological development. 
  Toyota boasts a wealth of accumulated know-how 
regarding vehicle electriﬁ cation technology and com-
mercialization that dates back to the launch of the 
Prius 20 years ago. We will continue to advance ini-
tiatives to accelerate our technological development 
and further reduce CO2 emissions. 
Connected Strategy: Information
Big data collected from cars will enable a wide range 
of new mobility services, such as accident and 
breakdown prediction, the generation of dynamic 
maps using probe data (vehicle tracking information 
generated using GPS), and agent functions to help 
users drive safely and comfortably. 
  Aiming to build new business models, Toyota is 
shifting toward a focus on electriﬁ cation, intelligence, 
and information, and has created what it calls 
Connected Strategy. The three pillars of this strategy 
are as follows. 1. Connect all cars to build a data col-
lection platform, 2. Utilize big data to revolutionize 
Toyota’s business, and 3. Collaborate with partners 
in various other industries and IT companies to pro-
duce new mobility services. 
  We aim to combine Toyota’s strengths—such as 
know-how developed in the automobile manufactur-
ing business and contact with customers through 
sales of more than 10 million vehicles annually—and 
the strengths of companies in other industries, 
including IT. By doing so, even as car usage shifts 
from ownership toward service-based models, we 
are working to create a safe, convenient, and excit-
ing future mobility society by providing customers 
with appealing services. 
Automated Driving and Utilizing AI: Intelligence
Toyota’s overall development philosophy for auto-
mated driving technology is the Mobility Teammate 
Concept, an approach built on the belief that people 
and vehicles can work together in the service of safe, 
convenient, and efﬁ cient mobility.
  We believe that it is essential that we develop auto-
mated driving technology to be human-centric and, 
above all, safe. In addition to sophisticated safe driving 
assistance, we are developing automated systems 
that can perform full-time dynamic driving. At the 
same time, by utilizing our advanced safety technolo-
gy know-how, we are working to promote the rapid 
uptake of new safety technologies in the market.
  Toyota has established Toyota Research Institute, 
Inc., with Dr. Gill Pratt, one of the world’s foremost AI 
researchers, as its CEO, and set up a related venture 
capital fund. Through these efforts, we are accelerat-
ing initiatives in such areas as automated driving, AI, 
and robotics. 
  Toyota believes that safe, fun automated driving 
technologies will expand freedom of movement for 
all, bringing cars and people even closer together, 
such that cars will continue to be loved by people.

Advancing Our Business Structure
Toyota is working to enhance its true competitive-
ness, particularly in the automobile manufacturing 
business, and shifting to new business models. In 
line with these strategies, we are advancing initiatives 
focused on ensuring ongoing growth 10 years from 
now, 20 years from now, and beyond. Seeking to 
break free of the restraints of Toyota’s existing con-
ventions and rules, we have started from scratch, 
focusing on the future as we set about to advance 
business innovation. Ongoing growth will be impossi-
ble unless we overcome the major issues created by 
Toyota’s expansion. Today, Toyota makes and sells 
more than 10 million automobiles annually. To survive 
at this scale, we are establishing new ways of oper-
ating to achieve the following two targets. 
(cid:129)  Develop a sufﬁ cient number of people who can 
lead with quick judgment, quick decisions and

(cid:129)  Reduce the time and effort consumed by cross-

  One of Toyota’s traditional strengths has been the 
process by which its experts on each function and 
process engage in thorough discussion to ﬁ nd opti-
mal solutions. However, before we began our current 
efforts to advance business innovation, overemphasis 
on function-based logic and reasoning had become a 
weakness, leaving Toyota unable to make quick deci-
sions in response to a rapidly changing environment.  
  Toyota regards the changes it has been making as 
opportunities. We seek to take on new challenges, 
unrestrained by existing approaches and remember-
ing always that there are better methods waiting to 
be discovered.
Making Ever-better Cars and 
Developing People
Toyota has revised its internal organization a number 
of times to enhance true competitiveness and pro-
mote sustainable growth.
In 2011, we adopted a system of autonomous 
region-based management, stationing the chief ofﬁ cers 
responsible for each region in their respective regions to 
ensure operations are more closely linked with local 
communities. In 2013, we adopted the Business Unit 
System, under which we organized workﬂ ows by busi-
ness model. Through these efforts, we made progress 
toward achieving management closely rooted in local 
areas and speedy product development. 
  At the same time, however, it became clear that 
even with these changes, Toyota’s ways of operating 
were still basically extensions of the old forms, and

thus carried with them the same problems— 
coordination across functions and decision making 
were taking too long. 
In April 2016, we adopted a new system with 
smaller business units organized around products, 
aiming to dissolve the barriers between functions, 
reduce the need for cross-unit coordination, speed 
up decision making, and better link all the work we 
do to making ever-better cars while developing 
human resources to support that goal. 
  Speciﬁ cally, we concentrated our forward-looking 
R&D and production engineering teams within the 
Advanced R&D and Engineering Company and estab-
lished four vehicle-based companies specializing in 
compact cars, mid-size cars, commercial vehicles 
(CVs), and the Lexus brand. We furthermore concen-
trated powertrain component-related operations in the 
Powertrain Company and connected technology-
related operations in the Connected Company.
  The new product-based companies serve to remove 
all barriers between functions, consolidating the entire 
process from planning to production under the authority 
and responsibility of a single leader and providing all 
necessary business functions within a compact struc-
ture for streamlined, integrated operations. 
  Toyota also reorganized its head ofﬁ ce, which is 
responsible for corporate functions. We established 
the Corporate Strategy Division, charged with formu-
lating long-term strategy for ongoing growth, and the 
Frontier Research Center, responsible for actively 
incorporating insight from outside the Company to 
create the technologies and businesses of the future 
from a long-term, society-oriented perspective. 
  Continuing our business innovation efforts, we 
established the EV Business Planning Department in 
December 2016. Then, in January 2017, we created 
the Emerging-market Compact Car Company, aiming 
to bring highly competitive ever-better cars to market 
based on Daihatsu Motor Co., Ltd.’s approach to 
manufacturing affordable, high-quality products. 
In this way, we set up the EV business as an internal 
start-up under the direct control of the president. This 
too was in order to make a clean break from old hab-
its and establish fast ways of operating to help drive 
Toyota’s overall efforts to advance business innovation.  
In April 2017, a year after transitioning to the new 
system, in line with our ongoing Company-wide busi-
ness innovation efforts, we established the GAZOO 
Racing Company, aiming to leverage our accumulat-
ed motor sports know-how to develop and release 
cars that offer customers true Waku-doki (excitement 
and exhilaration that wows you). We also consolidat-
ed our regional business units into the Business 
Planning & Operation Unit, unifying region-based 
operations to facilitate cooperation with the product-

  The new framework has enabled the consolidation 
of responsibility and authority in the company presi-
dents, helping to speed decision making. 
  Furthermore, the new framework has helped us oper-
ate with a greater awareness of the entire car manufac-
turing process. This has brought to light previously 
unnoticed issues, and better positioned us to ﬂ exibly 
change organizational frameworks going forward. 
  Toyota is stepping up its competitiveness by 
making ever-better cars while making a strategic 
shift toward electriﬁ cation, information, and intel-
ligence to advance initiatives aimed at expanding 
future mobility value. To achieve the goals of our 
long-term strategies, we are developing human 
resources and revamping internal structures and 
advancing business innovation while reinforcing 
alliances with a wide range of partners, including 
those in other industries. Looking at the enor-
mous changes surrounding cars as opportunities, 
Toyota is steadily advancing toward the creation 
of a better mobility society.

Eco-car Strategy: Electriﬁ cation 
Toyota considers responding to environmental issues a top management 
priority and has long endeavored to contribute to the realization of a sus-
tainable mobility society. To this end, we have taken on tremendous 
challenges, resulting in, for example, the release of the world’s ﬁ rst mass-
produced hybrid vehicle, the Prius, in 1997, and a fuel cell vehicle, the 
Mirai, in 2014. 
  Nevertheless, severe heat, heavy rainfall, drought, and other extreme 
weather phenomena attributable to climate change caused by rising lev-
els of greenhouse gases continue to threaten livelihoods around the 
world. Furthermore, the world’s reserves of oil, the main energy source 
that powers cars, are not inﬁ nite. In response to these circumstances, in 
2015, Toyota unveiled the Toyota Environmental Challenge 2050, starting 
work on six challenges aimed at not only eliminating CO2 emissions, but 
making a net positive impact on the planet and society. 
  The ﬁ rst of the six challenges is the New Vehicle Zero CO2 Emissions 
Challenge, under which we aim to reduce global average new vehicle 
CO2 emissions by 90% from Toyota’s 2010 global level. Toyota is devel-
oping and promoting the use of a variety of eco-cars to help achieve the 
Paris Agreement* goal of keeping global warming below 2°C.
*  The Paris Agreement, reached in December 2015, was negotiated at the 21st yearly session of 
the Conference of the Parties (COP 21) to the United Nations Framework Convention on 
Climate Change, held in Paris. The agreement set the long-term goal of limiting global warming 
to well below 2°C compared with pre-industrial levels and calls for net zero anthropogenic 
greenhouse gas emissions to be reached during the second half of the 21st century. 
Toyota’s Environmental Technology Strategy
Toyota believes that it is vital to pass down to the next generation the 
gains in the mobility of people and things achieved thus far by global 
mobility society while also addressing climate change and the uncertain 
future of petroleum resources. We are therefore focusing efforts on 
developing eco-cars that save energy and use diverse fuels while also 
promoting their widespread use. Automotive fuels can be produced by 
processing a variety of primary energy resources. By developing different 
powertrains optimized for a range of such fuels, Toyota is working to 
save energy and respond to fuel diversiﬁ cation.
  As illustrated in the chart entitled “Alternative Fuel Comparison” on the 
next page, there are multiple alternatives to petroleum, each with its own 
pros and cons. Similarly, energy policy varies by country and region. 
Toyota is advancing development on all fronts, including hybrid vehicles 
(HVs), plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHVs), fuel cell vehicles (FCVs), and electric 
vehicles (EVs). Each type of eco-car has a unique set of characteristics. 
By enabling customers to pick eco-car that is right for them, we believe 
that we are helping to build a highly energy-efﬁ cient mobility society.

Eco-car Strategy: Electriﬁ cation 
Accelerating Electriﬁ cation Initiatives
Toyota is advancing development on all fronts, with a particular focus on 
electric and hydrogen power, which it views as especially promising 
approaches to fuel diversiﬁ cation. FCVs offer convenience on par with 
conventional gasoline vehicles in terms of cruising range and refueling 
time. Moreover, hydrogen can be produced from a wide variety of mate-
rials and used for a wide range of applications. And, while EVs currently 
face hurdles due to battery limitations, namely cruising range and charg-
ing time, they offer the advantages of being chargeable at home and 
requiring only relatively simple infrastructure development. Policies and 
regulations aimed at promoting the use of zero-emission vehicles are 
developing rapidly around the world. Toyota believes that it is therefore 
necessary to advance the development of eco-cars in a way that is 
responsive to the energy challenges and infrastructure of each country 
and region as well as the ways customers use vehicles. 
  We take such an approach with EVs, one zero-emission vehicle 
option; at the end of 2016, we set up the EV Business Planning 
Department as an internal start-up aimed at creating and releasing prod-
ucts based on the market characteristics of individual countries and 
regions. Aiming to quickly bring EVs to market, the new department is 
amassing a wide range of technological know-how and resources from 
the Toyota Group, such as those of Toyota Industries Corporation, Aisin 
Seiki Co., Ltd., and DENSO Corporation, working within a small 
 corporate structure to advance development at a speed not seen before. 
  We entered a business and capital alliance with Mazda Motor Corporation 
toward the goal of making more-appealing cars, announced in August 2017. 
One aim of this alliance is joint development of technologies for electric cars. 
Demand and expectations for EVs are growing worldwide. Details are yet to 
be determined, but Toyota and Mazda are considering the joint development 
of technologies for the basic structure of competitive electric vehicles. These 
technologies will enable rapid, ﬂ exible response to changing regulations and 
market conditions. To the extent necessary for the joint development of EVs, 
we aim to combine the strengths of both companies and freely share know-
how related to EVs in order to nimbly and efﬁ ciently respond to difﬁ cult-to-
predict changes in the EV market during the development period. In addition, 
in late September 2017, Mazda, Denso, and Toyota signed a joint technology 
development agreement related to basic structural technologies and estab-
lished EV C.A. Spirit Corporation to facilitate said development. 
  Toyota’s Corolla Hybrid and Levin Hybrid, equipped with hybrid units pro-
duced in China, have been well received in the Chinese market. We intend to 
release plug-in hybrid variants of the Corolla and Levin in this market in 2018 
and are considering plans to introduce EVs within a few years. 
  The development of both EVs and FCVs presents opportunities to 
leverage Toyota’s electriﬁ cation technologies, which have been honed by 
its extensive know-how and experience regarding hybrid technology, one 
of Toyota’s core technologies. 
  As our competitors also accelerate their electriﬁ cation initiatives, we 
expect that competition to procure onboard batteries will intensify. 
Among secondary batteries, which can be repeatedly charged and used, 
lithium ion batteries offer the best performance in terms of power and 
energy per unit mass and volume. Toyota developed the world’s ﬁ rst 
method for observing the behavior of lithium ions contained in lithium ion 
batteries’ electrolyte solution during charging and discharging. This is 
expected to lead to new insights in research and development aimed at 
improving battery performance and durability, helping to enhance the 
cruising distance and battery life of PHVs and EVs. 
  Lithium ion batteries employ ﬂ ammable organic solvents, so they must 
be built to prevent leaks. Given this, Toyota is advancing R&D aimed at 
creating a solid-state battery that will serve as a high-performance, next-
generation battery. In addition to R&D conducted by our own dedicated 
internal R&D divisions, we are working with universities and other 
research organizations in this area. 
Building a Low-carbon Society
Spurred by the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics, further develop-
ment toward the creation of a hydrogen society is expected in the coming 
years. Toyota seeks to contribute to this development. Since the 2014 
release of the Mirai, Toyota has continued to focus on technological
