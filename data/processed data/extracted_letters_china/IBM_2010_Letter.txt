As the new century dawned, we saw change coming. The IT industry  
and the broader economy were being transformed by the rising tide of  
global integration, by a new computing model and by new client needs  
for integration and innovation.
And that meant we needed to transform ourselves.
1. We changed our business mix toward  
higher-value, more profitable technologies  
and market opportunities.
Segment Pre-Tax Income* 
($ in billions)
2. We became a globally integrated enterprise,  
improving productivity and capturing new growth.
Since 2005, global integration has enabled IBM to gain $6 billion in 
productivity savings while improving service quality. We have shifted 
resources toward building client relationships and employee skills, 
while positioning IBM for new market opportunities, such as business 
analytics, Smarter Cities and infrastructure build-outs underway in 
emerging markets.

3. By aligning our business model with our clients’ 
needs we generated superior financial results.
Financial Performance History 
(% of total revenue, $ in billions)
We achieved record earnings per share. 
Diluted earnings per share in 2010 were $11.52, having nearly 
tripled since the end of 2000, and marking eight consecutive 
years of double-digit growth. Our focus on productivity  
and a continuing shift in our business mix to more profitable 
segments has helped drive our performance. 
And record cash performance.  
In 2010 our free cash flow, excluding the year-to-year change in 
Global Financing receivables, was $16.3 billion—an increase of 
$1.2 billion from 2009. Since the end of 2000 we have generated 
$109 billion in free cash flow.

4. We invested in future sources of growth  
and provided record returns to shareholders … 
Since the end of 2000, we invested $43 billion in capital  
expenditures and $27 billion net on acquisitions (116 companies)  
targeted toward high-value areas.
We returned $89 billion to our shareholders as share repurchases  
and increased our dividend each year over the last decade.  
At the end of 2010 our quarterly dividend per share was five  
times higher than in 2000.
  … while continuing to invest in R&D — nearly  
$60 billion since the end of 2000.

5.  Today, we run a business model that delivers  
long-term value and high performance.
Early in 2007, we established our earnings per share road map  
to 2010.  It provided clarity about our business model, objectives  
and key factors driving performance. The road map also aligned  
all IBMers against a set of long-term objectives. 
We achieved $11.52 of EPS in 2010, well above the high  
end of the range of $10 to $11 during one of the toughest  
economic environments in decades. 
This resulted in superior returns to investors over the  
road map period. 
Now, our 2015 Road Map continues the drive to higher  
value—with the expectation of at least $20 operating EPS  
in five years (non-GAAP).*
Key objectives over the next five years:
•  $100 billion in free cash flow
•   Software becomes about 
•  $70 billion of capital returned 
  to shareholders
•   $20 billion in spending  
on acquisitions

•   Growth markets

Today our investments are fueling growth initiatives 
that are expected to drive $20 billion in incremental 
revenue by 2015.
Growth Markets
Approaches 
30%
of IBM’s  
geographic revenue by 2015 
Opportunity:  
The emerging market GDP growth  
rate—expected to be 5 percent  
through 2015—is more than double  
that of major markets.   
2015 Road Map Objective:  
Growth Markets revenue  
approaches 30 percent of IBM’s  
geographic revenue by 2015.
Cloud
$7billion  
in revenue by 2015
Opportunity:  
Cloud is a new, highly efficient model  
for consuming and delivering IT-based 
services. It is made possible by virtualizing 
resources, automating processes  
and standardizing tasks so they can be  
offered as easy-to-use services.
2015 Road Map Objective:  
Cloud revenue is expected to be  
$7 billion by 2015, of which $3 billion  
is incremental.
A historic economic expansion is underway in the  
emerging markets of the world—as their populations  
join the middle class and their economies join the global 
marketplace. In the largest of these emerging markets, 
such as China, India and Brazil, IBM is broadening  
its well-established base of skills and capabilities, nearly 
doubling our number of branch locations. In less  
developed markets, such as Africa, we are leveraging 
anchor clients in sectors like communications and  
banking. Our recent partnership with Bharti Airtel Africa to 
provide 21st century wireless telecommunications across  
16 countries of Sub-Saharan Africa is one example.
IBM has helped thousands of clients in areas as diverse  
as banking, healthcare and government build their own 
clouds or securely tap into IBM cloud-based business and 
infrastructure services. IBM manages millions of cloud-
based transactions every day and provides cloud analytics 
services to clients like Seton Hall University, Petco, Speedo 
and Crocs.
ING, a major player in the financial services industry, 
engaged IBM to design and build a cloud platform that will 
speed the delivery of new services to millions of clients and 
employees. Danone is working with IBM to provide a secure 
cloud trading network for its customers and business 
partners, while ADP is using IBM’s cloud integration 
software to expand its tax filing offerings to new markets 
serving employers of all sizes.

Business Analytics
$16billion  
in revenue by 2015
Opportunity:  
Global data volumes are predicted  
to increase by 29 times over the next  
10 years to 35 zettabytes.* (A zettabyte  
is a 1 followed by 21 zeros.) 
2015 Road Map Objective:  
Business analytics revenue is   
expected to be $16 billion by 2015.
Smarter Planet
$10billion  
in revenue by 2015
Opportunity:   
The infusion of digital intelligence into 
industries, infrastructures, processes  
and cities can make them more  
productive, efficient and responsive. 
2015 Road Map Objective:  
Smarter Planet revenue is expected  
to be $10 billion by 2015.
Enterprises need a way to manage and mine the deluge  
of potentially valuable information, and the key is advanced 
data analytics. IBM spotted this emerging need early, 
building the world’s leading analytics practice—with  
7,800 expert consultants, the world’s premier nonacademic 
mathematics function and the acquisition of 25 companies, 
for $14 billion in gross spending, to deepen our capabilities.
Our scientists have received more than 500 analytics 
patents. They are expanding technology frontiers through 
breakthroughs like the powerful new computer named 
Watson, which competed and won on the television  
quiz show Jeopardy! Applying Watson’s use of advanced 
analytics to decipher natural language, IBM is working  
to identify better healthcare diagnoses, potential  
drug interactions and “what if” scenarios in finance  
and compliance.
In 2008 and 2009, we articulated a point of view on ways 
the world can become smarter, and in 2010, we deployed 
significant resources to capture the opportunity in key, 
high-growth industries where our experience and solution 
delivery is strongest. We also expanded our Smarter Cities 
initiative, targeting local leaders who influence trillions in 
spending worldwide. In Rio de Janeiro, IBM is developing  
a system to integrate real-time information and processes 
across many city departments, including civil defense, 
transportation and meteorology, for a sustainable opera-
tions infrastructure in the face of unprecedented growth. 
Similar city infrastructure projects are underway in cities 
across the world such as Ho Chi Minh City, Shanghai, 
Seoul, Sydney, Helsinki, Amsterdam, Rotterdam, San 
Francisco and Washington, D.C.

In our second century, as in our first, IBM’s business model 
is based on continuous forward motion.
Through 100 years of a commitment  
to innovation and progress … 
Inventing core technologies …
A commitment to research …
Through breakthroughs like the FORTRAN programming  
language in 1957, computer memory in the 1960s, the relational 
database in the 1970s, reduced instruction set computing (RISC)  
in the early 1980s, and materials science advances in the 1990s 
(now in millions of mobile devices), IBM built the foundations for a  
world of instrumented, interconnected and intelligent systems. 
Defining computing architectures …
From punched card tabulators in the 1920s, to the compatible 
mainframe System/360 in the 1960s, to the PC in the 1980s,  
to parallel computing in the 1990s, IBM has shaped the modern  
IT industry. Today IBM is leading shifts to enterprise cloud  
computing and building highly optimized systems like Watson  
able to understand and analyze natural language.
