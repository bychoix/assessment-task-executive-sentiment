LETTER TO  
SHAREHOLDERS
Dear Fellow Shareholders:
2016 was an eventful year for our 
company, our country and the world. 
As the year progressed from a first 
half defined by economic anxiety and 
volatility to a second half impacted 
by a series of political upsets and 
surprises, we demonstrated the power 
and resilience of Citi’s unique global 
franchise by helping our millions of 
customers and clients around the world 
navigate an environment far more 
challenging than anticipated. 
The nearly $15 billion in net income 
we earned in 2016 is a reflection 
of the momentum we built across 
many of our core businesses while 
continuing to make the investments 
necessary for future growth. Among 
the many milestones we marked on 
the road to achieving our ultimate 
goal of being an indisputably strong 
and stable institution, I’d like to 
highlight the following:
In our Global Consumer Bank, we 
continued to focus our footprint with 
the announcement of plans to divest 
our retail banking and credit card 
businesses in Argentina, Brazil and 
Colombia, strategic decisions that 
enable us to consolidate our finite 
resources on our three major consumer 
markets: the U.S., Mexico and Asia. 
In the U.S., we converted 11 million 
Costco customers to our platform over 
a weekend in June while adding an 
additional 1 million new cardholders 
in the next six months. We also 
extended our nearly three-decade-long 
relationship with American Airlines and 
renewed an important partnership with 
The Home Depot.
In Mexico, where we enjoy scale and a 
strong market position, we rebranded 
our franchise Citibanamex and 
embarked on a multi-year $1 billion 
investment program that includes 
the modernization of our branches 
and upgrades to our technology. This 
investment reaffirms our long-standing 
commitment to our North American 
neighbor, and our continued confidence 
in its growth prospects.
We also made progress meeting the 
evolving needs of our customers by 
massively accelerating our mobile-first 
digital strategy. Our newly formed Citi 
FinTech unit spearheaded the first 
mobile app that combines banking, 
wealth management and money 
movement for our Citigold clients. 
And in Asia, we entered into promising 
partnerships with ride-hailing platform 
Grab, hospitality pioneer Airbnb 
and Lazada Group, a leading online 
shopping and selling site.
revenue and margin growth for the 12th 
consecutive quarter. Our #1 ranking in 
the influential Greenwich Associates’ 
Annual Survey for Global Fixed Income 
Market Share further confirmed that 
Citi has gained more market share 
in FICC than any of our competitors 
worldwide, and that our market shares 
in fixed-income and equities have risen 
to their highest point since the crisis.
We distinguished ourselves by advising 
on 10 transactions worth $140 billion 
in market value in a single week. These 
included advising Time Warner on its 
$108 billion transaction with AT&T, 
B/E Aerospace on its $8 billion sale 
to Rockwell Collins, TD Ameritrade on 
its $4 billion acquisition of Scottrade 
Financial Services and seven significant 
others. Over the course of the year, 
our bankers also served as advisors on 
other landmark transactions including 
to Dell and Silver Lake Partners on the 
$67 billion acquisition of EMC and to 
Baxalta on its $32 billion acquisition by 
Shire. Being named Bank of the Year  
for 2016 by International Financing 
Review recognized our position as an 
industry leader.
We also continued to make progress 
in our journey toward being a simpler, 
smaller, safer and stronger institution.
In our Institutional Clients Group, 
revenues rose 10 percent for the year 
in Fixed Income and Equities, while our 
industry-leading Treasury and Trade 
Solutions (TTS) business, the largest 
proprietary closed-loop mover of money 
in the world, generated year-over-year 
With the non-core assets in Citi 
Holdings down to just 3 percent of 
Citigroup’s balance sheet, we no longer 
will report Holdings results separately. 
At its peak, Holdings had more than 
$800 billion in assets and was capable 
of producing multi-billion dollar losses

the year. And with a Supplementary 
Leverage Ratio of 7.2 percent, both ratios 
exceed regulatory requirements and 
show we have capacity to continue to 
increase the amount of capital we return.
All these milestones and achievements 
underscore what might easily constitute 
our boldest headline of the year: Our 
restructuring is over. Today, Citi has 
returned to its roots with two core 
businesses appropriately scaled to serve 
customers and clients who benefit from 
our global network and footprint. 
With a revenue base balanced across 
products and regions — firmly supported 
by a business model that would be 
difficult, if not impossible, to replicate 
in today’s environment — our unique 
and resilient global franchise is not only 
well-suited to meeting the needs of 
our customers and clients around the 
world but is also, importantly, beginning 
to produce the capital returns our 
investors expect and deserve.
Despite these accomplishments and 
our ongoing success, however, we 
recognize that with respect to the 
goals and targets we set for ourselves, 
our performance last year fell short. 
Specifically, our core Citicorp net 
income dropped from $16.3 billion 
in 2015 to $14.3 billion last year; our 
Citigroup Efficiency Ratio rose to  
59 percent in 2016 from 57 percent in 
2015; our Return on Assets decreased 
from 95 basis points in 2015 to 82 
basis points last year; and our Return 
on Tangible Common Equity (ROTCE) 
dropped from 9.3 percent in 2015 to  
7.6 percent last year.

in a single quarter. In contrast, its last 
quarter of results was its 10th straight 
with a profit, and we remain committed 
to keeping the portfolio at a break-
even level or better. Significantly, we 
were the only one of eight U.S. banks 
found by the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation and the Federal Reserve to 
have no deficiencies in our Resolution 
and Recovery Plan. 
And we meaningfully increased the 
amount of capital we return to our 
shareholders. In 2016, we returned 
nearly $11 billion in capital to you, and 
— combined with the announcement of 
an incremental increase of $1.8 billion 
we made in November — we raised

our total capital return for the 2016 
Comprehensive Capital Analysis and 
Review cycle to $12.2 billion. To put that 
figure in context, that’s nearly 10 times 
the $1.3 billion in capital we returned 
just two years ago. 
We returned this capital through a 
larger dividend and buybacks, which 
reduced the number of common shares 
outstanding by 181 million, or 6 percent, 
and increased our Tangible Book Value 
per share by 7 percent to $64.57.
Even after returning that capital, we 
ended the year with a Common Equity 
Tier 1 Ratio of 12.6 percent, 50 basis 
points higher than when we started

LETTER TO  
SHAREHOLDERS
Why? First, early last year, despite the 
volatility in the markets, we decided to 
push ahead with our plans to invest in 
Cards, Equities, Mexico, TTS, Citigold, 
and much-needed infrastructure and 
technology across the franchise. We 
also saw expected smaller gains on 
asset sales in Citi Holdings, which 
further reduced our top-line results. 
All that aside, we do have a clear path 
to producing those better returns 
you have every reason to expect and 
deserve. That path primarily relies on 
drivers that are within our control:
First, our raw earnings power, which 
consists of continuing to drive client 
engagement, continuing to grow 
wallet share, continuing to monetize 
the investments we’ve made in our 
franchise, and continuing to improve 
our efficiency through simplification, 
digitization and expense discipline. 
Second, our capital base optimization, 
which consists of continuing to wind 
down our non-core assets, continuing 
to utilize our Deferred Tax Assets (DTA) 
while reducing the amount of capital 
we need to support them, and seeking 
to return as much regulatory capital 
to shareholders as we possibly can 
above the amount needed to prudently 
operate and invest in our businesses. 
Third, our operating environment, 
including the expected upward 
trajectory of the Federal Funds Rate. 
We believe that strong execution 
against all three drivers will place our 
updated financial targets firmly within 
reach, including: a 10 percent ROTCE 
excluding our disallowed Deferred Tax 
Assets in 2018; and a 10 percent ROTCE 
including our DTA in 2019. Longer term, 
we believe Citi is capable of generating 
a 14% ROTCE.
While expectations for growth have 
gained conviction since the election 
of Donald J. Trump as U.S. president, 
some have questioned whether our 
globality is a vulnerability in the current 
political environment. To the contrary, 
we see it as an advantage. Trade policy 
and agreements may take different 
forms and reflect different priorities, 
but trade isn’t going away. And our 
network is uniquely situated to helping 
our clients — many of whom are U.S. 
and non-U.S. multinationals we serve 
in dozens of countries — navigate these 
changes, whether through supply chain 
optimization, our advisory capabilities 
or trade finance.

Our confidence is rooted in a deep 
conviction that at Citi, we have the 
right model, the right strategy, the right 
customers and clients, and the right 
people in the right places to meet our 
updated targets.
It’s also clear that to fulfill our promise 
and potential to be the world’s best 
global bank, we must continue to 
demonstrate that we provide not 
just economic value to our clients 
and customers but social value to 
communities around the world. 
We are ahead of schedule in fulfilling 
our 10-year, $100 billion Sustainable 
Progress Initiative, dedicated to 
financing solutions that produce lower 
carbon emissions to safeguard our 
environment and natural resources.
And in 2016, we increased our lending 
to small businesses in the U.S. to more 
than $11 billion, raising our total over the 
last five years to nearly $50 billion. Once 
again, we were the leading financer of 
affordable housing in the U.S., as had 
been the case for seven years in a row. 
We recently announced the global 
expansion of the Citi Foundation’s 
pioneering Pathways to Progress 
initiative — which last year achieved its 
initial goal of connecting 100,000 people 
in 10 U.S. cities to better skills, better 
jobs and better career opportunities — 
from a purely domestic initiative into 
a major $100 million investment to 
connect 500,000 young people inside 
and outside the U.S. to training and jobs 
over the next three years. It’s the largest 
philanthropic commitment in our over 
200-year history.
