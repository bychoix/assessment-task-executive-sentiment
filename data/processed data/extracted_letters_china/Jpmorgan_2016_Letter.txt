Dear Fellow Shareholders,
Jamie Dimon,
Chairman and  
Chief Executive Officer
I begin this letter with a sense of gratitude and pride about JPMorgan Chase that 
has only grown stronger over the course of the last decade. Ours is an exceptional 
company with an extraordinary heritage and a promising future. 
Throughout a period of profound political and economic change around the world, 
our company has been steadfast in our dedication to the clients, communities and 
countries we serve while earning a fair return for our shareholders. 
2016 was another breakthrough year for our company. We earned a record $24.7 billion 
in net income on revenue 1 of $99.1 billion, reﬂecting strong underlying performance 
across our businesses. We have delivered record results in six out of the last seven 
years, and we hope to continue to deliver in the future. 
Our stock price is a measure of the progress we have made over the years. This 
progress is a function of continually making important investments, in good times and 
not so good times, to build our capabilities — people, systems and products. These

the extraordinarily difficult legal, regulatory and political environments that followed. 
We have long contended that these factors explained why bank stock price/earnings 
ratios were appropriately depressed. And we believe the anticipated reversal of many 
negatives and the expectation of a more business-friendly environment, coupled with 
our sustained, strong business results, are among the reasons our stock price has done 
so well this past year. 
As you know, we believe tangible book value per share is a good measure of the value 
we have created for our shareholders. If we believe our asset and liability values are 
appropriate — and we do — and if we believe we can continue to deploy this capital at 
an approximate 15% return on tangible equity, which we do, then our company should 
ultimately be worth considerably more than tangible book value. If you look at the 
chart below, you’ll see that tangible book value “anchors” the stock price.
In the last ﬁve years, we have bought back $25.7 billion in stock. In prior years, I have 
explained why buying back our stock at tangible book value per share was a no-
brainer. While the ﬁrst and most important use of capital is to invest in growth, buying 
back stock should also be considered when you are generating excess capital. We do

Tangible book value over time captures the company’s use of capital, balance sheet and profitability. In this chart, we are looking at 
heritage Bank One shareholders and JPMorgan Chase & Co. shareholders. The chart shows the increase in tangible book value per share;  
it is an after-tax number assuming all dividends were retained vs. the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (S&P 500), which is a pre-tax number 
with dividends reinvested.
1 On March 27, 2000, Jamie Dimon was hired as CEO of Bank One.
currently have excess capital. Five years ago, we offered the example of our buying 
back stock at tangible book value and having earnings per share and tangible book 
value per share substantially higher than they otherwise would have been just four 
years later. While we prefer buying our stock at tangible book value, we think it makes 
sense to do so at or around two times tangible book value for reasons similar to those 
we’ve expressed in the past. If we buy back a big block of stock this year (using analyst 
earnings estimates for the next ﬁve years), we would expect earnings per share in ﬁve 
years to be 3%—4% higher, and tangible book value would be virtually unchanged. 
In this letter, I discuss the issues highlighted on the next page — which describe many 
of our successes and opportunities, as well as our challenges and responses. Like last 
year’s letter, we have organized much of the content around some of the key questions 
we have received from shareholders and other interested parties.

--- Page 8 ---
I.  
The JPMorgan Chase franchise
1. Why do we consider our four major business franchises strong and market leading? 
2.  Why are we optimistic about our future growth opportunities?
3.  What are some technology and ﬁntech initiatives that you’re most excited about? 
4.  How do we protect customers and their sensitive information while enabling them 
to share data? 
5.  What are your biggest geopolitical risks?
6.  Although banks and other large companies remain unpopular with some people, 
you often say how proud you are of JPMorgan Chase. Why?  
II.   Regulatory reform
1. 
Talk about the strength and safety of the ﬁnancial system and whether Too Big  
to Fail has been solved. 
2.  How and why should capital rules be changed?
3.  How do certain regulatory policies impact money markets?
4.  How has regulation affected monetary policy, the ﬂow of bank credit and the 
 growth of the economy? 
5.  How can we reform mortgage markets to give qualiﬁed borrowers access to the 
credit they need? 
6.  How can we reduce complexity and create a more coherent regulatory system?
7.  How can we harmonize regulations across the globe?
III.   Public policy
1. 
The United States of America is truly an exceptional country.
2.  But it is clear that something is wrong — and it’s holding us back.
3.  How can we start investing in our people to help them be more productive and 
share in the opportunities and rewards of our economy?
4.  What should our country be doing to invest in its infrastructure? How does the lack 
of a plan and investment hurt our economy?
5.  How should the U.S. legal and regulatory systems be reformed to incentivize 
investment and job creation?
6.  What price are we paying for the lack of understanding about business and  
free enterprise?
7. 
Strong collaboration is needed between business and government.

I. THE  JPM OR GAN  CH ASE FR ANCHI SE
1. Why do we consider our four major business franchises strong and market leading?
The chart below and those on page 8 speak 
for themselves. Looking closely at the actual 
numbers, it’s clear that every business is 
among the top performers ﬁnancially – 
whether you look at eﬃciency (overhead 
ratios) or return on equity (ROE) vs. the best 
in that business. More important, customer 
satisfaction is at the center of everything 
we do. Each business has gained market 
share – which is possible only when you are 
improving customer satisfaction and your 
products and services relative to the competi-
tion. And each business continues to inno-
vate, from customer-facing apps, to straight-
through processing, to digitized trading 
services or payment systems. Our business 
leaders do a great job describing their busi-
nesses, and I strongly encourage you to read 
their letters following this year’s Letter to 
Shareholders. Each will give you a feel for 
why we are optimistic about our future.

2.  Why are we optimistic about our future growth opportunities?
We believe we have substantial opportuni-
ties in the decades ahead to drive organic 
growth in our company. We have conﬁdence 
in the underlying growth in the U.S. and 
global economies, which will fuel the growth 
in our customer base – consumer deposits, 
assets under management and small to large 
clients globally. This growth will obviously 
be faster in emerging markets than in devel-
oped markets – and we are well-positioned 
to serve both. In addition, we believe we 
can continue to gain share in many markets 
and, over time, add new, relevant products. 
This can drive organic growth for years. 
Capturing this growth is very basic:
(cid:228)(cid:3) Selectively adding investment bankers 
and private bankers around the world
(cid:228)(cid:3) Bringing consumer and commercial 
banking branches and capabilities to more 
places in the United States
(cid:228)(cid:3) Adding wholesale branches overseas and 
carefully expanding into new countries
(cid:228)(cid:3) Adding wholesale and Private Bank clients 
as they grow into our target space
Equally important is using technology and 
ﬁntech to do a better job serving clients and 
to grow our businesses – with better products 
and services. You can read more about our 
big data, machine learning, payment systems, 
cybersecurity and electronic trading on pages 
47–68 described by our senior executives. But 
I do want to highlight a few items in the next 
question that pertain to these topics.
3.  What are some technology and ﬁntech initiatives that you’re most excited about?
One of the reasons we’re performing well as 
a company is we never stopped investing in 
technology – this should never change. In 
2016, we spent more than $9.5 billion in  
technology ﬁrmwide, of which approxi-
mately $3 billion is dedicated toward new 
initiatives. Of that amount, approximately 
$600 million is spent on emerging ﬁntech 
solutions – which include building and 
improving digital and mobile services and 
partnering with ﬁntech companies. The 
reasons we invest so much in technology 
(whether it’s digital, big data or machine 
learning) are simple: to beneﬁt customers 
with better, faster and often cheaper prod-
ucts and services, to reduce errors and to 
make the ﬁrm more eﬃcient.
We are developing great new products. 
We are currently developing some exciting 
new products and services, which we will be 
adding to our suite and rolling out later this 
year, including: 
(cid:228)(cid:3) End-to-end digital banking – The ability to 
open an account and complete the majority 
of transactions on a mobile phone.
(cid:228)(cid:3) Investment advice and self-directed 
investing – Online vehicles for both indi-
vidual retirement and non-retirement 
accounts, providing easy-to-use (and 
inexpensive) automated advice, as well as 
enabling our customers to buy and sell 
stocks and bonds, etc. (again inexpensively).
(cid:228)(cid:3) Electronic trading and other online services 
(e.g., cash management) in our Corporate 
& Investment Bank and Asset & Wealth 
Management businesses – Oﬀering our 
clients a more robust digital platform.

I.  THE JPMORGAN CHA SE FRA NCHIS E 
We are investing in data and technology to 
improve the ﬁnancial health of low-income 
households.
Over the last two years, the JPMorgan Chase 
Institute has helped identify some of the 
most pressing ﬁnancial challenges facing 
American households, such as their diﬃculty 
managing income and expense volatility. 
We are using that data to select and support 
innovative ﬁntech companies and nonproﬁts 
that are designing solutions to address these 
challenges. One example of these eﬀorts 
is JPMorgan Chase’s Financial Solutions 
Lab, which, in partnership with the Center 
for Financial Services Innovation, seeks to 
facilitate the next generation of ﬁntech prod-
ucts to help consumers manage their daily 
ﬁnances and meet their long-term goals. 
Highlights of the initiative include: 
(cid:228)(cid:3) To date, the Lab has helped support more 
than 18 ﬁntech companies working to 
improve the ﬁnancial health of more than 
1 million Americans. One example is Digit, 
an automated savings tool that identi-
ﬁes small amounts of money that can be 
moved into savings based on spending 
and income. To date, it has helped Ameri-
cans save more than $350 million.
(cid:228)(cid:3) Lab winners have raised more than $100 
million in follow-on capital.
(cid:228)(cid:3) In 2017, we launched a new competition 
seeking innovative ﬁntech solutions to 
promote the ﬁnancial health of popula-
tions often overlooked, such as people of 
color, individuals with disabilities and low-
income women. 
We are successfully collaborating with other 
companies to deliver ﬁntech solutions.
Whether it is consumer payment systems 
(Zelle), mortgages (Roostify), auto ﬁnance 
(TrueCar), small business lending (OnDeck 
Capital) or communications systems 
(Symphony), we are successfully collabo-
rating with some excellent ﬁntech companies 
to dramatically improve our digital and other 
customer oﬀerings. I’d like to highlight just 
two new exciting areas:
(cid:228)(cid:3) Developer Services API store – By 
providing direct interfaces with our appli-
cations (fully controlled, of course), we are 
enabling entrepreneurs, partners, ﬁntech 
companies and clients to build new prod-
ucts or services dedicated to speciﬁc needs.
(cid:228)(cid:3) Bill payment and business services – 
While I can’t reveal much at the moment, 
suﬃce it to say there are some interesting 
developments coming as we integrate our 
capabilities with those of other companies.
4. How do we protect customers and their sensitive information while enabling them to share data?
For years, we have been describing the risks 
– to banks and customers – that arise when 
customers freely give away their bank pass-
codes to third-party services, allowing virtu-
ally unlimited access to their data. Customers 
often do not know the liability this may 
create for them, if their passcode is misused, 
and, in many cases, they do not realize how 
their data are being used. For example, access 
to the data may continue for years after 
customers have stopped using the third-party 
services. 
We recently completed a new arrangement 
with Intuit, which we think represents 
an important step forward. In addition to 
protecting the bank, the customers and 
even the third party (in this case, Intuit), it 
allows customers to share data – how and 
when they want. Under this arrangement, 
customers can choose whatever they would 
like to share and opting to turn these selec-
tions on or oﬀ as they see ﬁt. The data will 
be “pushed” to Intuit, eliminating the need 
for sharing bank passcodes, which protects 
the bank and our customers and reduces 
potential liabilities on Intuit’s part as well. 
We are hoping this sets a new standard for 
data-sharing relationships.

5.  What are your biggest geopolitical risks?
Banks have to manage a lot of risks – from 
credit and trading risks to technological, 
operational, conduct and cybersecurity risks. 
But in addition to those, we have exposures 
around the world, which are subject to 
normal cyclical and recession risks, as well  
as to complex geopolitical risks.
There are always geopolitical risks, and 
you can rest assured we are continuously 
reviewing, analyzing and stress testing them 
to ensure that our company can endure them. 
We always try to make certain that we can 
handle the worst of all cases – importantly, 
without disrupting the eﬀective operation of 
the company and its service to our clients. We 
think these geopolitical risks currently are in 
a heightened state – that is, beyond what we 
might consider normal. There are two speciﬁc 
risks I want to point out:
Brexit and the increasing risk to the European 
Union (EU). 
Regarding Brexit, a key concern is to make 
sure our company is prepared to support our 
clients on day one – the ﬁrst day after the 
actual Brexit occurs, approximately two years 
from now. We are conﬁdent we will be able 
to develop and expand the capabilities that 
our EU subsidiaries and branches will need 
to serve our clients properly in Europe under 
EU law. This will require acquiring regulatory 
approvals, transferring certain technologies 
and moving some people. On day one, we 
need to perform all of our critical functions 
at our standards. For example, underwriting 
debt and equity, moving money and accepting 
deposits, and safeguarding the custody assets 
for all of our European clients, including 
many sovereigns themselves. We must be 
prepared to do this assuming a hard exit by 
the United Kingdom – it would be irrespon-
sible to presume otherwise. While this does 
not entail moving many people in the next 
two years, we do suspect that following Brexit, 
there will be constant pressure by the EU not 
I.  THE JP MORGAN CHASE F RANCHI SE 
to “outsource” services to the United Kingdom 
but to continue to move people and capabili-
ties into EU subsidiaries.
We hope that the advent of Brexit would lead 
the EU to focus on ﬁxing its issues – immi-
gration, bureaucracy, the ongoing loss of 
sovereign rights and labor inﬂexibility – and 
thereby pulling the EU and the monetary 
union closer together. Our fear, however, is 
that it could instead result in political unrest 
that would force the EU to split apart. The 
unraveling of the EU and the monetary union 
could have devastating economic and political 
eﬀects. While we are not predicting this will 
happen, the probabilities have certainly gone 
up – and we will keep a close eye on the situa-
tion in Europe over the next several years. 
De-globalization, Mexico and China.
Anti-globalization sentiment is growing in 
parts of the world today, usually expressing 
itself in anti-trade and anti-immigration posi-
tions. (I’m not going to write about immigra-
tion in this letter – we have always supported 
proper immigration – it is a vital part of the 
strength of America, and, properly done, it 
enhances the economy and the vitality of 
the country.) We do not believe globalization 
will reverse course – we believe trade has 
been absolutely critical for growth around 
the world and has beneﬁted billions of 
people. While there are some issues with our 
trade policies that need to be ﬁxed, poorly 
conceived anti-trade policies could be quite 
disruptive, particularly with two of our key 
trading partners: Mexico and China. 
The trade deal with Mexico through NAFTA 
is simpler than the one with China. (In full 
disclosure, JPMorgan Chase is a major inter-
national bank in Mexico, with revenue of 
more than $400 million, serving Mexican, 
American and international clients who do 
business there.) Mexico is a long-standing 
peaceful neighbor, and it is wholly in our 
country’s interest that Mexico be a pros-
perous nation. This actually reduces immi-
gration issues (there are now more Mexicans
