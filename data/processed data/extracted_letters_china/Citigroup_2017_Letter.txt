Michael L. Corbat
Chief Executive Officer
Dear Fellow Shareholders:
When we look back at 2017 from the vantage point of a few years from 
now, I am confident we will point to it as a year Citi decisively emerged 
from a prolonged period of simplification and restructuring into a new era 
of sustainable client-led growth. 
The growth we are driving today is sustainable, balanced and less exposed 
to predictable and unpredictable risks than in the past. It is not going to 
come from acquiring competitors, entering new territories, or expanding 
into ancillary businesses that don’t fit our strategy. It is going to come from 
serving our consumer and institutional clients with distinction. It is going 
to come from earning and keeping clients’ trust and safeguarding their 
security. And it is going to come from being seen as an indisputably strong 
and stable company that takes as much justifiable pride in the positive 
impacts we have on society as in our financial achievements.
That is the context in which, on Investor 
Day in July 2017 — our first in nine 
years — I reiterated our conviction that 
with our restructuring complete, we 
had crossed an inflection point. From 
2017 forward, the decisions we made 
to focus our franchise, invest in our 
capabilities and improve our client 
experience are bearing fruit in the form 
of a more compelling value proposition, 
accelerating growth and improved 
returns for shareholders. Our overriding 
goal is to combine the positive impact 
of an improving macroeconomic 
environment with even stronger 
business performance to consistently 
deliver higher returns on capital and 
increased return of capital to our 
shareholders through 2020 and beyond.
On an operating basis, our 2017 financial 
results strongly support the strategy 
we presented on Investor Day. Yet as 
a consequence of the passage of tax 
reform legislation in the U.S. in the fourth 
quarter of 2017, we took a one-time, non-
cash charge of $22.6 billion, resulting in 
a net loss on a reporting basis for the 
year of $6.8 billion. Having put that one-
time charge behind us, however, we can 
now focus on the positive impacts of tax 
reform for us and our clients. A lower tax 
rate leads to higher net income, which, 
combined with a multi-billion-dollar 
reduction in our tangible common equity, 
will have a powerful positive impact on 
our returns. We estimate the impact of 
tax reform should drive our Return on 
Tangible Common Equity (ROTCE) up by 
200 basis points or more. On a symbolic 
level, reducing the value of our Deferred 
Tax Assets (DTA) — our remaining 
remnant of the financial crisis — indelibly

marks not just the end of a year, but the 
end of an era.
The solid growth we achieved in our core 
consumer and institutional businesses 
came from a more focused country 
presence in consumer and a more 
selective client base in institutional, 
each of which is roughly half the size it 
was at its peak. We have continued to 
execute on investments to streamline 
our infrastructure and drive further 
growth in targeted areas including our 
Mexico, U.S. Cards, Treasury and Trade 
Solutions, Equities and Investment 
Banking franchises.
In Global Consumer Banking, which 
serves more than 100 million consumer 
clients in 19 markets in three regions 
— Asia, Mexico and the U.S. — total 
revenues were up 4 percent over 2016. 
From a product perspective, Global Retail 
Banking grew loans and assets under 
management as we continued to shrink 
our physical footprint. Global Cards also 
delivered good growth, driven by higher 
loan and purchase sales volumes in all 
three regions.
Our Institutional Clients Group delivered 
an impressive performance, driving total 
revenues up 7 percent. Banking revenues 
were higher across our franchise, from 
our backbone Treasury and Trade 
Solutions to Investment Banking, the 
Private Bank and Corporate Lending. 
In our Markets and Securities Services 
segment, a weaker performance in Fixed 
Income and Equities compared to the 
more robust trading environment in 
2016 was offset by growth in Securities 
Services. Once again we demonstrated 
the value of balance across and within 
our businesses. 
Investor Day 2017
Citi hosted our first Investor Day in nine 
years on July 25. It was an opportunity 
to engage directly with investors and 
share the progress we’ve made as a 
firm, as well as our objectives going 
forward. The core message was that 
we’ve crossed an inflection point as a 
firm. Topics included the momentum 
we’re seeing in our businesses, our 
competitive advantages and the 
confidence we have in our strategy.
Excluding the impact of tax reform, our 
2017 net income of $15.8 billion was 
nearly $1 billion — or 6 percent — higher 
than our 2016 net income. On this basis, 
earnings per share rose to $5.33, up 13 
percent over the prior year, including 
a benefit from share repurchases. We 
also made progress toward the targets 
we introduced on Investor Day. Due 
to strong expense management, we 
delivered a full-year Efficiency Ratio of 
58 percent, a more than 150 basis point 
improvement from 2016. We increased 
our Return on Assets to 84 basis points. 
And we achieved a ROTCE of 8.1 percent, 
including the impact of our DTA. And 
excluding the impact of our disallowed 
DTAs, our ROTCE rose to 9.6 from 9 
percent in 2016, showing progress 
toward the 10 percent target we talked 
about on Investor Day.
With regard to improving the return 
of capital to our shareholders, the 
solid results we achieved on our 
Comprehensive Capital Analysis and 
Review (CCAR) “stress test” again 
enabled the planned return of $19 
billion during the current CCAR cycle. 
That laid the foundation for us to 
reduce our outstanding share count 
by over 200 million and return over 
$17 billion of capital to shareholders 
in 2017 through common share 
repurchases and dividends. We 
announced our intention to return — 
subject to regulatory approval — at 
least an additional $40 billion of 
capital to shareholders over the next 
two 2018 and 2019 CCAR cycles. 
The Federal Reserve and the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corporation found 
no deficiencies or shortcomings in our 
2017 Resolution Plan. Both milestones 
underscored the progress we made in 
2017 toward our longstanding goal of 
being an indisputably strong and  
stable institution.
I would like to put these results in the 
broader context of a mindset shift 
we see as critical to sustaining these 
positive trends and trajectories into 
an uncertain future. We cannot control 
the macroeconomic or interest rate 
environment. But we can and must 
control the impacts our decisions  
and actions have on our clients’ 
experience of their interactions  
and engagements with us.

Letter To Shareholders
We know our clients’ expectations for 
seamless experiences are rising by the 
day. In response to that reality, our 
consumer bank launched three times as 
many digital features in 2017 as we did 
in 2016, driving double-digit growth in 
digital and mobile clients worldwide. 
In our institutional business, Citi’s online 
banking platform CitiDirect BE® was 
ranked # 1 for the twelfth consecutive 
year in the 2017 Greenwich Associates 
Digital Banking Benchmarking study. We 
partnered with Nasdaq on the rollout of 
a pioneering application of blockchain 
and distributed ledger technology 
to facilitate and automate payment 
processing. Our Treasury and Trade 
Solutions business, which provides cash 
management and trade finance services 
to multinational corporations and public 
sector clients worldwide, also launched 
a host of digital offerings designed to 
make our global network, the world’s 
largest money mover, even more of a 
competitive advantage than it is today.
All the innovations we launched, crucial 
to serving clients with distinction, 
would not have stood a chance of 
gaining traction or acceptance with 
clients if they required reassurance that 
our reputation or values were sound. 
Fortunately, the strong foundation 
we have built, based on a culture of 
competence, compliance and control 
precedes us. On a number of occasions 
in 2017, I had an opportunity to reaffirm 
those core values as events transpired  
to make taking a stand not just right  
but necessary. 
On the third day of January, in response 
to a newly-released Executive Order 
on Immigration in the U.S., I wrote to 
my roughly 210,000 Citi colleagues in 
nearly 100 countries where we open our 
doors every day to remind them that our 
diversity is a value not just fundamental 
to our present and future, but — given 
our globality — a real competitive 
advantage for our firm. 
To accelerate progress on this important 
front, I asked at least one of my direct 
reports to co-lead each of our newly-
established Affinity Groups — including 
Pride, Black Heritage, Asian Heritage, 
and Citi Salutes, dedicated to veterans’ 
support — with another senior Citi leader. 
I wrote and said to my colleagues as I 
made that announcement that while 
I know we have more work to do, our 
track record at getting difficult things 
done makes me confident that we will 
get to where we need to go. 
In honor of our 12th annual Global 
Community Day, I joined my colleagues 
to plant trees, organize the library and 
install computers at a primary school 
outside Mexico City. I felt just as much 
pride in the project as I did in the fact 
that I was joining over 100,000 others 
as they revitalized parks, served and 
collected food to those in need, and

in so many other ways volunteered to 
serve our communities.
Our commitment to support the 
communities we serve was sorely tested 
by the devastation wrought by hurricanes 
Harvey and Irma, which in rapid 
succession swept through Texas, Florida 
and the Caribbean. In those and other 
areas impacted by natural disasters in 
2017, including Mexico City, which suffered 
a massive earthquake, and Southeast 
Asia, hit hard by flooding, hundreds of 
our people went to extraordinary lengths 
to support and protect their colleagues, 
clients and communities. Working closely 
with local and global nonprofits, including 
the American Red Cross, in all those 
stricken communities our rapid response 
efforts provided funds, necessities and 
volunteer contributions to those in urgent 
need of relief. My Citi colleagues delivered 
22 tons of food and supplies to colleagues 
and communities across Puerto Rico in 
the wake of the storms. Over a two-week 
period after Irma and Harvey, we further 
supported the Red Cross by enabling it to 
re-route phone calls to specially trained 
agents in our Hagerstown, Maryland call 
center, who assisted 1,800 individuals  
in search of emergency support or  
family members.
The vast human and property losses 
those destructive storms left in their 
wake were powerful reminders of the 
extreme weather many more places 
are experiencing as a result of global 
warming. With extreme weather events 
becoming more common, enhancing 
resiliency is a key objective of our 
efforts to finance vital infrastructure in 
partnership with public sector agencies 
and entities worldwide.

Three years ago, we established a new 
Environmental Finance goal with a 
ten-year target to finance and facilitate 
$100 billion in environmental finance 
activity and we are on track to meet it 
several years early. In February 2017 
we announced a new goal to obtain 
100 percent of our global energy needs

Foundation’s groundbreaking Pathways

in ten U.S. cities to skills, jobs and career 
opportunities, went global. Now, the 
program is targeting 500,000 at-risk 
youth to be reached worldwide by 2020. 
The Foundation’s $100 million investment 
in Pathways is the largest single 
philanthropic commitment in its history.
In conclusion, a word I used more than 
once at our Investor Day to describe 
how I feel about where we are today and 
where we are going is “pride.” The Citi 
of today and tomorrow is a place all our 
colleagues are proud to work for and all 
our clients can be proud to work with. I 
am grateful to you for standing with us. 
Looking back on the decisions we made 
to prudently grow, and the decision you 
made to invest with us, I hope you share 
my conviction and belief that our best 
days and years are to come.
Sincerely,
