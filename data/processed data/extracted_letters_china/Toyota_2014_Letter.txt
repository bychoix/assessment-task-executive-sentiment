Toyota in 10 Years and 100 Years
With the goal of making ever-better cars, the Toyota Global Vision is an articulation of the kind of company we want to be. It is based on shared values and a spirit of monozukuri (conscientious manufactur-
ing) passed down since our foundation and embodied in the core values of Sakichi Toyoda, the Guiding Principles at Toyota, and the Toyota Way. We use the image of a tree to illustrate our vision: the roots 
are our shared values; the ongoing upward growth of its branches represents our efforts to expand business; the fruit represents making ever-better cars and enriching lives and local communities; and the 
trunk is our stable base of business. As the trunk of the tree grows bigger and stronger, it is able to support more branches—the creation of ever-better cars. This is the trajectory that puts Toyota on the 
path toward sustainable growth.
  Of all the components of our vision, building ever-better cars takes priority. We want to deliver products and services that surprise and excite our customers. We want to be a company that puts smiles on 
faces—and keeps them there.

Environmental concerns must be taken into 
account when we think about creating a “mobility 
society” (that is, a highly mobile society reliant on 
automobiles as its major means of transporta-
tion). The Guiding Principles at Toyota, set forth in 
January 1992, declared that we will “dedicate our 
business to providing clean and safe products 
and to enhancing quality of life everywhere through 
all of our activities.” In line with this principle, in 
December 1997, Toyota launched the world’s first 
mass-produced hybrid vehicle, the Prius.
  The environment is still a top-priority manage-
ment issue. In addition to hybrid vehicles, Toyota 
has been developing next-generation eco cars, 
including plug-in hybrid vehicles, electric vehicles, 
and fuel cell vehicles. Believing that the spread of 
eco cars is in itself good for the environment, 
Toyota has focused on hybrid vehicles, selling 
more than six million in total as of December 
2013. Although it took nine years and nine 
months for cumulative sales to reach the one 
million mark in May 2007, strengthening demand 
has accelerated the popularization of hybrids. 
After passing the four million mark in April 2012, it

  Based on the concept of producing the optimal 
vehicle in the optimal location at the optimal time, 
Toyota has broadened its hybrid lineup and now 
offers at least one in each automobile category. 
We believe hybrids have finally entered a full-scale 
growth phase and are no longer niche products.
  Toyota calculates that as of December 31, 2013, 
use of Toyota hybrids* had resulted in approxi-
mately 41 million fewer tons of CO2 emissions** 
than would have been emitted by gasoline-powered 
vehicles of similar size and driving performance. 
Toyota also estimates that the use of its hybrid 
vehicles has saved approximately 15 million kiloli-
ters of gasoline compared with the amount that 
would have been used by gasoline-powered vehi-
cles of similar size. Hybrid vehicles offer lower CO2 
emissions and lower fossil fuel consumption.
  As of the end of August 2014, Toyota has 27 
hybrid models and one plug-in hybrid model on 
the market in about 80 countries and regions. 
Furthermore, within the next two years (2014 and 
2015), we plan to launch a total of 15 new hybrid 
models worldwide. Taking advantage of our 
pioneer status, we will continue adding to this 
lineup and increasing the number of countries and 
regions where we sell hybrids, with the ultimate 
aim of popularizing eco cars around the world.

Further advances in key technologies  
for hybrid technology
Hybrid technology can be applied to the develop-
ment of all sorts of environment-friendly vehicles 
and can be found in a wide variety of powertrains. 
Toyota has positioned hybrid technology as a 
core environmental technology for the 21st 
century. As a pioneer in the mass production of 
hybrid vehicles, we are continuing to improve this 
technology.
  Power semiconductors have a big impact on 
the effectiveness of hybrid technology. Hybrid 
systems offer excellent fuel economy through the 
efficient use of two power sources: gasoline 
engines and electric motors. A large number of 
power semiconductors are used in the power 
control unit (PCU), a device situated between the 
motor, power generator and batteries. The PCU 
controls the output of the motor. Some of the 
electrical current that flows through the power 
semiconductors in the PCU is lost as heat; in fact, 
approximately 20% of a hybrid vehicle’s overall 
electricity loss is from the power semiconductors. 
PCU volume: 1/5
PCU with silicon power  
semiconductors  
(Production model) 
The PCU plays a vital role in controlling electricity usage, 
recharging batteries with electricity generated when the 
vehicle decelerates and accelerating the vehicle by supply-
ing electricity to motors from the battery bank while driving.
PCU with SiC power  
semiconductors 
(Future target)
For this reason, making power semiconductors 
more efficient will improve fuel economy. Toyota 
has been developing its own power semiconduc-
tors as a key technology for improving fuel econ-
omy since the launch of its first-generation Prius 
in 1997. In the latest, third-generation Prius, elec-
tricity loss has been reduced to a quarter of that 
of the first-generation Prius.
  Aiming to make tomorrow’s Toyota better than 
today’s, we are developing power semiconductors 
that use next-generation silicon technology, namely, 
silicon carbide (SiC), a material that is a compound 
of silicon and carbon. We have already improved 
fuel economy more than 5%* in a prototype 
featuring the new SiC power semiconductors. As 
early as possible, Toyota aims to commercialize 
SiC power semiconductors that offer a 10%* 
improvement in fuel economy through greater 
 efficiency. In addition, we aim to shrink the PCU 
to one-fifth the size of current PCUs through 
the use of SiC power semiconductors.

Building the right cars in  
the right places
Over half a century has passed since Toyota 
exported its first two Crowns to North America in 
1957, and it has been almost 30 years since 
Toyota started building cars in North America, 
beginning with New United Motor Manufacturing, 
Inc., in 1986.
  Through the 1980s, Toyota was well known as 
a maker of mid-sized and compact passenger 
cars, such as the Camry and Corolla, as well as 
the Hilux small pickup truck. In 1989, Toyota 
launched the Lexus brand as its entry into the 
luxury passenger car market. From that point 
onward, it expanded its lineups of luxury vehicles 
and cars for young drivers as well as light-duty 
trucks, and introduced hybrid models, changing 
its image as a carmaker and increasing its pres-
ence in the U.S. market.
  Cumulative production volume in North 
America reached 10 million vehicles in 2001, 20 
million vehicles at the end of 2008, and 25 million 
vehicles in October 2012. In May 2014, Toyota’s 
plant in Kentucky, which started production in 
May 1988, became the first Toyota plant outside 
Japan to have produced 10 million vehicles.
  Today, in the United States and Canada, Toyota 
has 11* manufacturing companies, three distribu-
tors, and a network of more than 1,750 dealers 
that sell more than two million Toyota and Lexus 
vehicles annually.
In our quest to innovate and make tomorrow’s 
Toyota even better than today’s, we have decided 
to establish a new North American headquarters, 
moving our regional manufacturing, sales and 
marketing, corporate, and financial services head-
quarters to a single location in Plano, Texas. The 
move is intended to increase efficiency and 
collaboration throughout the organization, with 
the ultimate aim of ensuring sustained growth in 
North America by creating a business structure 
that allows us to deliver ever-better cars to 
customers.
  Ahead of this strengthening of our business 
foundation and in line with our principle of build-
ing the right cars in the right places, we have 
assigned an American as the chief engineer over-
seeing the redesign of the flagship Camry model. 
Cumulative production volume at Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky has reached 10 million vehicles.
Under his guidance, and based on intricate market 
research, the Camry has evolved into a car with 
bold form and solid handling.

Fuel cell vehicles: ideal eco cars
Automobiles can be powered by a wide range of 
energy sources, including gasoline, diesel, natural 
gas, synthetic liquid fuel, biofuel, electricity, and 
hydrogen. Two strategies are being taken to 
address environmental problems caused by the 
mass consumption of fossil fuels: using less 
petroleum and diversifying energy sources. 
Combining high thermal efficiency, low fuel 
consumption engines and a host of advanced 
 pollution. In addition to producing zero emissions 
when driven, fuel cell vehicles are also highly prac-
tical. Their defining characteristic is their long cruis-
ing range. They can also be refueled very quickly.
  As a source of electrical power during emer-
gencies, a fuel cell vehicle is capable of powering 
a typical home for roughly a week. Because of 
their simultaneous achievement of zero emissions 
and high practicality, Toyota positions these vehi-
cles as the ultimate eco-car.
  However, one barrier to the proliferation of fuel 
cell vehicles is the need to create a refueling 
 infrastructure in the form of hydrogen stations. To 
ensure that our customers are able to operate 
fuel cell vehicles reliably, Toyota is cooperating in 
the establishment and operation of a hydrogen 
supply infrastructure in numerous countries and 
regions around the world.
  We have more than two decades of experience 
with fuel cell vehicles; we started development in 
1992 and launched the Toyota FCHV, the world’s 
first fuel cell SUV, in December 2002 on a limited 
basis in Japan and the United States. Toyota has 
developed a proprietary fuel cell stack and

leading levels.
  Toyota plans to start selling a fuel cell sedan in 
Japan before March 2015. At first, the new vehi-
cle will be sold only in major cities that plan to 
build hydrogen station networks. We are also 
preparing to launch the sedan in the United 
States and Europe around summer 2015. From 
the 2020s onward, we expect the market for fuel 
cell vehicles to increase significantly, with several 
tens of thousands of vehicles sold per year.
  Over the next 100 years, we believe electrified 
powertrains will hold the key to the future of the 
automobile. The first-generation Prius opened the 
door to this future in 1997, and a new era of 
transportation emerged once major challenges 
were overcome. Similarly, fuel cell vehicles repre-
sent the next stage in the development of a future 
“mobility society.” Toyota has embarked on a long 
journey toward making hydrogen an everyday fuel 
and fuel cell vehicles the norm.

 New Values for the Next Hundred Years   
 Message from the Executive Vice President Responsible for Accounting
Our DNA is Creating Ever-Better Cars
Toyota aims to deliver cars that open up new 
lifestyles for consumers, cars that change 
lives for the better and bring new discoveries. 
As we strive to do this, our ideals and pride in 
manufacturing are evident at every stage, 
from development through production and 
sales, and ensuring the performance and 
quality of every car we make.
  Toyota believes that cars are more than a 
means of transportation, being a source of 
excitement and exhilaration. At Toyota, we 
foster human resources to ensure that our 
DNA is passed on to future generations so 
that we can continue to sustainably create 
truly great cars.
Inherited expertise in manufacturing put 
to the test at world-class contests
Toyota’s competitiveness is derived from its 
manufacturing expertise and the passing on of 
this expertise to the next generation. Toyota 
participates in the WorldSkills Competition, which 
tests the competence of young employees (the 
under 22s), to create opportunities for the voca-
tional workers at the core of our operations to 
build on their abilities and learn advanced tech-
niques. Held once every two years since 1950, 
this international contest aims to encourage voca-
tional mastery, foster exchange among people of 
various nationalities, and nurture appreciation for 
technical workmanship. At the 42nd WorldSkills 
Competition held in Leipzig, Germany, in July 
2013, 1,007 competitors represented 53 coun-
tries and regions in 46 vocational skills. Eight 
employees from Toyota competed in seven voca-
tions, with two being awarded gold medals and 
all eight contestants receiving prizes. Toyota was 
responsible for two of the five gold medals won 
by Japan. Over the years, Toyota has won a total 
of 25 gold medals, 13 silver medals, and 9 bronze 
medals at this international contest.
In addition, four employees of Toyota in 
Thailand and Indonesia participated in two voca-
tional fields, taking home one gold medal and two 
silver medals. A culture emphasizing vocational 
skills has taken hold at our bases overseas. The 
Next WorldSkills Competition is slated for São 
Paulo, Brazil, in August 2015.
  The National Skills Competition has been held 
in Japan annually since 1963. Toyota has partici-
pated since 1966, and currently enters the 
competition in 10 vocational fields related to auto-
motive manufacturing. The 52nd National Skills 
Competition will be held in November 2014 in 
Toyota’s home prefecture of Aichi, with more than 
1,200 participants from across the country,

Creative skill use to make ever-better cars
At Toyota’s Takaoka Plant, production lines are 
occasionally referred to as “skill inheritance lines.” 
The production floor is a place where younger 
workers can learn craftsmanship as well as the 
rules and principles of manufacturing. These 
production lines were created with a sense of 
urgency, because we thought that opportunities

were being lost to pass vocational skills onward 
due to automation in plants limiting the ability of 
veteran technicians to ply their trade.
  The body remembers the experience of build-
ing something. When an issue arises, the experi-
ence can be drawn on to quickly get to the root 
of the problem through a cyclical process of 
hypothesis and verification. These advanced, 
hard-earned skills are reflected in production 
technologies, and through a constant evolution 
and sharpening of skills and technologies, a spiral 
of improvement leads to innovation.
  To reinforce its foundation for creating ever-
better cars, Toyota launched an initiative last year 
wherein young workers come into direct contact 
with how customers around the world use Toyota 
vehicles in various transportation environments. 
These young engineers, who were mostly 
dispatched to our overseas R&D centers, 
conducted surveys of market conditions, evalu-
ated local conditions, and participated in develop-
ment. The knowledge they gained through these 
experiences will help us create the ever-better 
cars of the future.
Knowledge and skills from the grueling 
world of motorsport go into making  
ever-better cars
For many years, Toyota has tested its vehicles on 
the race circuit in Nürburgring, Germany, which is 
regarded as the world’s most grueling course. 
With the aim of fostering human resources able to 
make ever-better cars, Toyota has taken this a 
step further and has participated in the 24 Hours 
of Nürburgring endurance race since 2007. The 
over-25-kilometer course combines the 
Nürburgring (North Loop) and the GP Course 
used by the F1 Grand Prix. Since 2012, Toyota 
has sent its “skill inheritance team” of mechanics 
comprising young employees with expertise in a 
variety of fields.
  Nürburgring features intense elevation changes 
of up to 300 meters on a course laid out like 
European public roads, complete with rough 
patches. During the race, the car design is tested 
and seasoned as the team members address 
unexpected problems that arise, with the group 
becoming closely attuned to the car and group 
cohesion strengthening. In an intense and short 
period, participants gain a profound appreciation 
of automobiles and a level of know-how and skill-
fulness that transcends their daily work. At our 
eighth appearance at the competition, 14 
mechanics from Toyota participated. Toyota won 
in the SP3 class, SP8 class, and the SP-PRO 
class, and the Toyota team finished in the best 
position with the highest number of laps it has 
ever accomplished.
  As Toyota manufacturing spreads globally, as 
the spirit of innovation is passed along at work-
places around the world, and as technologies 
and skills evolve, our DNA will continue to be 
passed on for not only the next 10 years but the 
next 100 years.

What Sets Toyota Apart
>  The improvement process is infinite, and 
Kaizen (continuous improvement)
Toyota has grown from a single core concept 
that is still shared by the entire Group: contrib-
uting to society by making ever-better cars.
  Some of the values and ideas that have 
defined Toyota over its 75-year history are 
listed below.
The Toyota Production System (TPS)
TPS encourages the complete elimination of 
waste, irregularities, and overburdening from 
the production process. The system, originally 
employed in the textile industry, is based on two 
fundamental concepts: jidoka, which can be 
loosely translated as “automation with a human 
touch,” and the Just-in-Time (JIT) principle. Under 
these concepts, if a problem occurs, the equip-
ment immediately stops running, preventing the 
manufacture of defective products, and at each 
stage production is limited to only what is needed, 
when it is needed, and in the amount needed.
>  Establish the facts through genchi genbutsu 
(on-site, hands-on experience)
>  Stop production lines when a problem 
occurs and implement corrective and 
improvement measures
The Nature of the Toyota Production System
after-the-fact improvements are in essence 
forward-looking improvements
These directives, which form part of Toyota’s 
management philosophy, are by no means limited 
to the production front-line. They apply universally 
to all endeavors. In effect, TPS represents the 
building blocks of Toyota’s human resource 
 development endeavors.
Genchi Genbutsu 
(on-site, hands-on experience)
The genchi genbutsu principle refers to much 
more than merely visiting a site to examine some-
thing in situ. It entails understanding and respect-
fully considering the opinions of on-site individuals 
as well as of individuals who have extensive rele-
vant knowledge. Genchi genbustu is thus a key 
concept in the improvement process. Furthermore, 
the notion of “respect for people” is consistent 
with Toyota’s founding philosophy, and is under-
pinned by the concept of thoroughgoing and 
direct communication.
Kaizen (continuous 
improvement)
Take a close look at each site
Consistently uncover issues

Building “true competitiveness”
To consistently deliver a higher level of quality and 
competitive products to its customers, Toyota 
must continue to nurture a corporate culture that 
places the utmost value on quality, productivity, 
and cost efficiency. In addition to an unwavering 
commitment to JIT that underscores our commit-
ment to the development of a short and efficient 
supply chain, we realize that we must also 
provide customers with a wide-ranging, compre-
hensive, and well-organized after-sales service 
network. From a long-term perspective, we can 
only stay competitive if we continue to focus on 
developing human resources, fostering relation-
ships of trust between management and labor, 
and ensuring that each employee remains 
committed to conscientious manufacturing. 
For its part, Toyota will continue to hone its true 
competitiveness, which provides the underlying 
strength for its manufacturing platform over the 
medium to long term. By doing so, we hope to 
ensure sustainable growth.
Representing a never-ending cycle of progress, the 
word kaizen encapsulates a spirit of striving for 
continuous improvement and a refusal to accept the 
idea that something cannot be made better. Toyota 
believes that acknowledging the possibility of contin-
uous improvement can make tasks easier and more 
enjoyable. From an organizational standpoint, kaizen 
involves the entire workforce while relying on the 
extensive knowledge, skills, and experience of the 
people working directly on the process. The concept 
is based on individuals taking ownership of their 
work and focusing on what should be done rather 
than on what can be done. At the same time, the 
kaizen process is underpinned by thoroughgoing 
and direct communication. It is essential to follow 
through once a decision has been made upon 
thorough deliberation with the participation of all. 
We consider this a valuable part of our corporate 
culture. Taiichi Ohno (1912-1990), a former Toyota 
executive vice president and founder of the Toyota 
Production System, once commented that while the 
wisdom of humankind was infinite, that wisdom 
tended to emerge only during periods of adversity. 
When things are not going well and a better method 
is discovered, it is critical that  suggestions be made 
openly, discussed, and put into practice to ensure 
continuous improvement.

 What Sets Toyota Apart   
 Enriching Lives and Building Tomorrow’s Toyota through Innovation [1 of 4]   
 New Values for the Next Hundred Years   
 Message from the Executive Vice President Responsible for Accounting
Enriching Lives and Building Tomorrow’s Toyota through Innovation 
Toyota aims to enrich lives and communities through innovations that make cars safer, more comfortable and more convenient. This will help create a future “Smart Mobility Society” in which cars are highly 
economical and energy efficient.
Safety in a “Smart Mobility Society”
To realize a safe and responsible automobile soci-
ety, Toyota has been developing safety technolo-
gies based on an “Integrated Safety Management 
Concept,” that involves a three-pronged, compre-
hensive approach to passengers, cars and trans-
portation systems, in pursuit of a practical safety 
strategy with the ultimate aim of zero traffic fatali-
ties and injuries. For Toyota, the “Integrated Safety 
Management Concept” is synonymous with vehi-
cle safety. To make cars safer, we concentrate on 
integrating safety systems, instead of having them 
function independently of each other.
  Vehicle-infrastructure cooperative systems use 
ITS (Intelligent Transport Systems) technology to 
establish car-to-car, car-to-pedestrian, and car-to-
road connections. These systems help prevent 
accidents and support safe driving environments 
by alerting drivers to pertinent information 
provided by roadside sensors and other vehi-
cles—information that is unobtainable using a 
single vehicle’s sensors alone. Toyota aims to 
make vehicle-infrastructure cooperative systems a 
reality as soon as possible, and has been working 
with government institutions to create standards 
for smart road infrastructure to upgrade the trans-
portation environment. We have been conducting 
field tests on public roads since 2006 in collabora-
tion with government agencies and other private-
sector companies. Moreover, by the mid-2010s, 
we intend to be the first company in the world to 
commercialize systems that use the 700 MHz 
band to establish connections between people 
and cars to support safe driving environments. We 
aim to create advanced driving safety systems by 
linking the automated safety systems of vehicles.
