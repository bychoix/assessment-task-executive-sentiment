15   STATEMENT OF THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT
Dear Shareholders,
The 2011 financial year was the best ever in the history of your Company, the BMW Group. We achieved 
new sales volume, revenues and earnings highs, and exceeded our targets.
The BMW Group remains the world’s top-selling premium car manufacturer  With almost 1.67 million 
vehicles sold, the BMW Group continues to be the world’s leading premium manufacturer in terms of sales 
volume. Our three automobile brands, BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce, also set new individual records. A further 
113,000 customers purchased a BMW or Husqvarna motorcycle. Our Financial Services business also con-
tributed to this positive sales development.
Revenues of € 68.8 billion and a profit before tax of more than € 7.3 billion also represent new highs for 
the Group. The BMW Group stands on a firm financial footing, maintaining our profitability. This provides 
us with additional flexibility in an uncertain environment and also gives us the ability to continue making 
important investments in the future.
Our capital expenditure of around € 3.7 billion in 2011 included investments in new products and the 
 expansion of our international production network. One thing is clear: we will continue to make major in-
vestments over the next few years. That is the only way to respond to growing demand for our vehicles and 
at the same time realise new drive technologies, industrialise electromobility and offer our customers 
 innovative mobility services. Our research and development expenses increased to more than € 3.3 billion in 
2011. This investment was primarily earmarked towards projects to secure our future growth.
We continue to strive for a good balance of growth between Europe, the Americas and Asia. We believe 
this is essential to economic success in a highly volatile environment. The same applies to our highly flexible 
international production network of 25 sites in 14 countries. In 2012, we will open a new plant in Tiexi, 
China. Future growth also exists in the BRIKT countries of Brazil, Russia, India, South Korea and Turkey. 
We intend to capitalise on this potential.
We are expanding our international presence in a global world. This will give us greater freedom from 
market and currency fluctuations, promoting our long-term success and enhancing our competitiveness. Not 
least, it will secure jobs in Germany and around the world. Germany continues to form the backbone of our 
production activities.
Consistent implementation of Strategy Number ONE is paying off  At the BMW Group, our ideas and 
actions are geared towards the long term. This is part of our corporate culture. Back in autumn 2007, before 
the global financial and economic crisis, we adopted our Strategy Number ONE with its four pillars: 
“Growth”, “Shaping the future”, “Profitability” and “Access to technology and customers”. This strategy lays 
out the guidelines for our Company to remain focused on profitability and long-term value creation in 
a changing environment and to achieve significant efficiency improvements. We set ourselves concrete 
profitability targets for 2012 and formulated our vision for 2020.
All of this has paid off – as our success in 2011 has shown. We deliver on our promises. As shareholders 
and investors, you support us in our long-term approach. I would like to thank you for your ongoing confidence 
in the Company and the decisions we make. 2011 confirmed that BMW shares are an attractive long-term 
 investment – as you have come to expect from a premium company.

Our success in 2012 and beyond  A clear focus on premium vehicles and premium services for individual 
mobility remains the core of our business model. We will continue to refine this approach. We do so in light 
of changing customer demands, stringent regulations and the demands placed on automobile manufacturers 
by different industrial policies in different countries. We reviewed our strategy in 2011 for this reason. All of 
our assumptions were verified against current trends and developments.
Our aim for the 2012 financial year is to build on past year’s success. We are targeting new highs in sales 
volume and pre-tax Group earnings. We intend to continue operating at a high level of profitability over the 
long term, which means maintaining an EBIT margin of between eight and ten per cent in the Automotive 
segment – assuming that there are no lasting negative economic conditions.
We benefit from an excellent starting position: we have a young and attractive product line-up. Regarding 
the BMW brand, the new BMW 3 Series will be playing a major role in 2012. The new BMW 3 Series Sedan 
has been available since mid-February. This was the first time we launched one of our models in all markets 
simultaneously. As well as incorporating a large number of technical innovations, our three lines, “Sport”, 
“Modern” and “Luxury”, will give customers even more choices for individualisation. We will also be adding 
the BMW brand’s new CO2 champion to our product range: the 163-horsepower BMW 320d EfficientDynamics 
Edition has a fuel consumption of 4.1 litres per 100 kilometres in the EU test cycle. This is equivalent to CO2 
emissions of 109 grams per kilometre. The BMW 320d will be followed in the autumn by the BMW ActiveHybrid 3, 
the world’s first fully hybrid compact sports sedan in the premium segment.
Another BMW product highlight this year will be the BMW 6 Series Gran Coupé. This vehicle, the first 
four-door coupé in the history of the BMW brand, will come onto the market in June. The revised BMW 7 Series 
will follow in July, bringing true luxury to the premium segment. The MINI family will expand to six 
 members in 2012 with the addition of the MINI Roadster. Rolls-Royce will maintain its successful course as 
the pinnacle of luxury motoring with its Phantom model series and the Rolls-Royce Ghost.
Shaping the mobility of tomorrow as a pioneer and trendsetter  We will begin series production of electric 
vehicles in late 2013 and intensive preparations are already underway. Electric propulsion is an option for 
all three of our brands. The first two concept cars from the new BMW i family attracted considerable attention. 
Our BMW i3 and BMW i8 prove that sustainable mobility and sheer driving pleasure go exceptionally well 
 together. At the same time, we are exploring totally new approaches to ensure environmentally and resource-
friendly production of BMW i models. The power for the assembly of BMW i models will be obtained solely 
from renewable sources – a first for the industry.
Resource-efficient production and sustainability are part of our premium promise. Measures to this effect 
are implemented at all our locations worldwide. As a result, the BMW Group has been rated the industry 
leader in all major sustainability rankings for many years.
Strategic alliances as part of Strategy Number ONE  The mobility of the future will take many forms. 
Accordingly, strategic collaborations with the best partners are an integral part of Strategy Number ONE. 
This secures long-term access to technologies and customers, pools expertise and achieves positive cost 
 effects through economies of scale. In our opinion, there are two key elements for good collaborations: first, 
the partnership must create a win-win situation. Second, the premium character and independence of our 
 vehicles and brands must always be assured.

17   STATEMENT OF THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT
In 2011 we opened a new production plant for carbon fibres in Moses Lake in the United States together 
with the SGL Group. It forms part of our international manufacturing network of ultra-light carbon-fibre 
 reinforced plastic (CFRP) for the BMW i family. Our years of experience using CFRP parts in automobile con-
struction give us a distinct advantage. Furthermore, we are positioning the BMW Group as a clear innovation 
leader in the field of lightweight construction.
We also strengthened our international multi-brand fleet management business with the acquisition of 
the ING Car Lease Group. As a result, the BMW Group now ranks among Europe’s top five fleet service 
 providers. With the expansion of our fleet management business, we are also laying an excellent foundation 
for developing modern mobility solutions and mobility services.
Our joint venture with PSA Peugeot Citroën was also successfully launched in 2011 as BMW Peugeot 
 Citroën Electrification. The joint development of components for electrification and hybridisation will also 
make the European automobile industry more competitive in the field of hybridisation.
A major breakthrough in electromobility will depend on further progress in lithium-ion battery technology. 
Our planned cooperation with Toyota Motor Corporation will contribute to this through joint research into 
battery cell technology.
The right approach to the challenges of our times  Business success depends on many different parameters. 
We believe that social responsibility and sustainable action are just as significant in this respect as growth, 
profitability and efficiency.
The Company’s success is only made possible through the dedication, creativity and team spirit of the 
 almost 100,000 employees of the BMW Group. On behalf of the Board of Management, I would like to thank 
all of our employees around the world for their commitment in 2011. I would also like to thank our entire 
 retail organisation, our suppliers and business partners.
The BMW Group is considered to be one of the most attractive employers. We recruited a total of 4,000 new 
staff in 2011, securing ourselves key competences for the future. We also embrace our responsibility for 
training young people. We increased the number of apprentices to 3,899 by the end of 2011.
We are shaping the mobility of today and tomorrow for our customers, and thereby building a stable 
foundation for the future of the BMW Group.
As our shareholders, you have continued to show your support and confidence in our abilities to manage 
the BMW Group. We strive to ensure that your Company remains an attractive investment and a profitable 
enterprise with a strong reputation and high level of credibility for years to come.
Norbert Reithofer
Chairman of the Board of Management

Record-breaking year for BMW Group 
The BMW Group experienced the best year of its corpo-
rate history in 2011, selling 1,668,982 BMW, MINI and 
Rolls-Royce brand cars (+ 14.2 %); this was more than 
ever  before in an annual period. With this performance, 
the BMW Group retains the pole position in the premium 
segment of the world’s car markets.
Sales volumes grew dynamically for all three car brands, 
each of them recording their best levels ever. Sales of 
BMW brand cars alone rose by 12.8 % to 1,380,384 units. 
A total of 285,060 units of the MINI brand were handed 
over to their new owners (+ 21.7 %). At 3,538 units, 
Rolls-Royce set a new sales volume record, posting an 
increase of 30.5 % on the previous year.
The Motorcycles segment put in another highly stable 
performance despite persistently unfavourable market 
conditions. In total, we handed over 113,572 BMW and 
Husqvarna brand motorcycles to customers during the 
year under report, 3.1 % more than in 2010. 
New records set both for revenues and earnings
Group revenues and earnings broke all existing records 
on the back of dynamic car sales volume growth and 
flourishing financial services business. Revenues in 
2011 totalled € 68,821 million, 13.8 % higher than in the 
previous year. Earnings were also strong, with profit 
 before financial result (EBIT) up by 56.9 % to € 8,018 
 million and profit before tax up by 52.1 % to € 7,383 mil-
lion.
The Automotive segment recorded a 16.8 % increase in 
revenues to € 63,229 million, with EBIT soaring to € 7,477 
million  (+ 71.7 %) and segment profit before tax reaching 
€ 6,823 million (+ 75.5 %).
Motorcycle segment revenues grew by 10.1 % to € 1,436 
million on the back of good sales volume performance. 
EBIT fell by 36.6 % to € 45 million, primarily due to re-
structuring measures taken at the level of Husqvarna. 
These measures also caused segment profit before tax to 
drop to € 41 million (– 36.9 %).
Financial Services business also made an important con-
tribution to the success of the BMW Group. With a 
 portfolio of 3,592,093 contracts in place with dealers 
and retail customers at the end of the year, the segment 
recorded growth of 12.6 %.
The Financial Services segment also performed ex-
tremely well, posting a 5.4 % increase in revenues to 
€ 17,510 million. In earnings terms, segment EBIT rose 
by 46.8 % to € 1,763 million and segment profit before 
tax by 47.4 % to € 1,790 million.

19   COMBINED GROUP AND COMPANY MANAGEMENT REPORT
Income tax expense for the year amounted to € 2,476 
million (+ 53.8 %), resulting in an effective tax rate 
of 33.5 %, marginally up on the previous year’s 33.2 %. 
Group net profit was significantly higher than in 2010, 
rising by 51.3 % to € 4,907 million.
Sharp increase in dividend
Reflecting the very strong earnings performance, the 
Board of Management and the Supervisory Board 
will propose to the Annual General Meeting to use 
BMW AG’s unappropriated profit of € 1,508 million to 
pay a dividend of € 2.30 for each share of common 
stock (2010: € 1.30) and a dividend of € 2.32 for each share 
of preferred stock (2010: € 1.32), a distribution rate of 
30.7 % for 2011 (2010: 26.5 %).
Capital expenditure increased
Capital expenditure on intangible assets and property, 
plant and equipment amounted to € 3,692 million in 
2011, 13.1 % higher than in the previous year (2010: 
€ 3,263 million). The main focus in 2011 was on product 
investments for new model start-ups (BMW 1 Series, 
3 Series), on infrastructure investments aimed at ex-
panding the production network and on the future pro-
duction of electric cars (BMW i3 and i8).
The BMW Group invested € 2,720 million in property, 
plant and equipment and other intangible assets in 
2011 (2010: € 2,312 million; + 17.6 %). Development 
 expenditure of € 972 million was additionally recog-
nised as assets (2010: € 951 million; + 2.2 %). The per-
centage of development costs capitalised decreased 
to 28.8 %, mainly due to model life cycle factors (2010: 
34.3 %).
The capital expenditure ratio for the year was unchanged 
at 5.4 % and therefore remained – thanks to the effi-
cient use of capital resources – well within the target 
range of below 7 % of Group revenues, despite substan-
tial  levels of investment in innovative products and 
technologies.
BMW Group strengthens market position in European 
fleet business
In July the BMW Group announced the purchase of ING 
Car Lease Group (ICL Group). This addition, combined 
with the existing Alphabet fleet business, increased 
the number of leasing and fleet management contracts 
handled by the BMW Group to approximately 540,000.

on the growing sector of full-service leasing. The expan-
sion of fleet management business provides the ideal 
foundation for developing forward-looking mobility so-
lutions and services.
BMW Group and SGL Group open new carbon fibre 
 production plant 
In September 2011, SGL Automotive Carbon Fibers – a 
joint venture of the BMW Group and the SGL Group – 
opened a new state-of-the-art carbon fibre manufacturing 
plant in Moses Lake, USA. The facility plays a major 
strategic role in the manufacture of ultra-lightweight 
carbon-fibre reinforced plastics (CFRP), which will be 
used extensively in the BMW i vehicles to be launched 
by the BMW Group from 2013 onwards.
CFRP is becoming increasingly important in the quest 
for lighter materials that minimise vehicle weight and 
thereby reduce both fuel consumption and CO2 emis-
sions. With their new production plant in Moses Lake, 
the BMW Group and the SGL Group are proving that 
targeted innovations can make a real eco-friendly con-
tribution towards the future of individual mobility.
Investment in SGL Carbon SE
BMW AG acquired 15.81 % of the share capital of SGL 
Carbon SE during the period under report, thus re-
inforcing our engagement in the area of lightweight 
 construction and the use of CFRP in carmaking.

General Economic Environment
Economic environment increasingly volatile
After a phase of global economic upswing that began 
in the second half of 2009, the last six months of 2011 
shows growing signs of a likely slowdown in the pace of 
worldwide economic growth in 2012. It also became 
 apparent that some of the world’s economies are facing 
a phase of stagnation.
Since summer 2011 the sovereign debt crisis plaguing 
the euro zone has given rise to a reassessment of the 
value of state bonds, shares and raw materials. In the 
short term, developments in the euro zone are likely 
to be the main single factor affecting global economic 
growth.
That having been said, rising public debt levels in the 
USA, alongside ongoing unsolved structural problems 
on the US employment and property markets also pose 
a risk to global economic growth in the current year, 
 despite any temporary signs of the situation stabilising.
Signs are emerging in China – currently the mainstay 
of global economic growth – of a significant increase 
in bad debts within the banking system, for which the 
property boom of recent years is partly to blame.
In view of these developments, forecasts for economic 
growth in 2012 have generally been scaled back. Fiscal 
policies, particularly in the USA, Europe and Japan, 
are likely to hold down growth for the time being. 
 Property markets in the USA, the UK and most of the 
euro zone continue to perform poorly. The situation in 
China is being exacerbated by the fact that property 
prices in major cities have been falling since mid-2011 
after having risen rapidly in the preceding years.
In terms of monetary policies, central banks in indus-
trial countries have more or less exhausted their re-
maining options in the period since the last crisis by 
adopting very expansive policies. Central banks in 
most emerging markets have also started to bring 
down interest rates in order to counter the negative im-
pact of a forthcoming global downturn on their local 
economies. The scope for interest rate reductions in 
these countries is, however, restricted by higher in-
flation rates. Reports on trading policies also raise fears 
of a new wave of regulation.
China was once again the main driver of global eco-
nomic growth in 2011, registering a growth rate in real 
terms of 9.0 % and, for the first time, contributing more 
than 10 % to global economic output. The growth rate 
lost impetus quite noticeably towards the end of the year 
as a result of lower revenues in the overheated property 
sector on the one hand and reduced export revenues on 
the other.
The growth rate in the USA – which still accounts for 
more than 20 % of global economic output – slowed 
down to 1.7 %, a significant drop on the previous year’s 
figure. High debt levels in the public sector and private 
sphere are proving to be a serious impediment to 
growth.
Markets in the euro zone developed highly diversely in 
2011. The average growth rate in the region was 1.6 %. 
With the exception of Germany, where the export- 
oriented economy again grew at the fairly healthy rate 
of 3.0 %, most of the other countries in Europe only re-
ported moderate growth. France's growth rate of 1.6 % 
was roughly in line with the average for the euro zone. 
The southern European countries and Ireland fared 
considerably worse due to a loss of confidence in their 
economies. The Italian and Spanish economies verged 
on stagnation, with growth rates in the region of 
0.5 %. Growth in Greece and Portugal continued to de-
teriorate. Germany is therefore one of the few countries 
within the euro zone to have returned to the economic 
output levels seen prior to the onset of the financial cri-
sis in autumn 2008.
The British economy, too, only recovered sluggishly from 
the financial crisis, posting growth of 0.9 % in 2011. 
Tax increases and spending cuts due to the government’s 
fiscal policies continued to dampen the employment 
market and discourage consumer spending, whilst mon-
etary policies allowed inflation to rise to the unusually 
high rate of 4.5 %.
The Japanese economy – beset by the natural catastro-
phe which caused massive restrictions in energy supplies 
and production cuts affecting industrial activities – 
was pushed into recession and contracted by 0.7 % com-
pared to the previous year.
The pace of economic growth also slowed in the major 
emerging markets. India saw growth fall to 6.8 %, mostly 
reflecting the negative impact of the high interest refer-
ence rate needed to bring down inflation, which was 
running at 9.0 %. A similar slowdown could be observed
