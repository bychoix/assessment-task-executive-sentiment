Letter From Your CEO
For 2014, Intel reported record revenue of $55.9 billion, up 6% from 2013. Net income rose 22% to $11.7 
billion, and earnings per share were $2.31. Our operating income of $15.3 billion was up 25% over 
2013. We achieved record annual unit shipments for PCs, servers, tablets, phones, and the Internet of Things.
Our strategy for growth is playing out well. We are driving our core businesses in personal computing  
and the enterprise, building on those assets to move into new areas such as the Internet of Things and 
wearables, strengthening Intel’s position in mobile, and continuing our relentless pursuit of Moore’s Law.  
The diversity and scale of Intel products today put us in a unique position to compete across the breadth  
of devices that compute and connect. 
Growing our core businesses
In PC clients, revenue of $34.7 billion was up 4% over 2013. Operating income of $14.6 billion was up 25%. We introduced  
the Intel® Core™ M processor family, designed to enable superior compute and graphics performance and long battery life in 
razor-thin, fanless mobile devices. In Chromebooks*, Intel now leads in market segment share. In data center products, revenue 
was $14.4 billion, up 18% over 2013, and operating income increased 31% as we capitalized on the growth of cloud computing 
and big data. We introduced next-generation Intel® Xeon® processors that enhance performance, efficiency, and security for 
compute, storage, and network workloads in cloud environments. 
Our core businesses are also providing valuable intellectual property to help us compete in diverse computing markets. For example, 
certain models of the ultra-thin Dell Venue* 8 tablet ship with Intel® RealSense™ technology, a 3-D camera capability we originally 
created for PCs. Likewise, Intel® Atom™ processors, developed first as an extension of our PC products family, are found in 
smartphones and tablets, as well as storage, networking, and computing devices in the data center and Internet of Things.  
Progress in mobile
We exceeded our goal to ship 40 million units for tablets during 2014, and became one of the largest silicon providers for tablets. 
The first U.S. smartphone powered by Intel® processors was introduced. We are ramping crucial LTE communications products 
and began shipping our second-generation 7260 LTE baseband modem. Landmark agreements with Rockchip and Spreadtrum  
in China give us new sources of innovation and partners with whom to scale Intel® architecture products. In 2015 we look to 
improve mobile profitability by further reducing costs through efficiencies and products such as our SoFIA System-on-Chip 
targeted for the mobile market segment.  
Leading in emerging sectors
We have made investments and established positions in emerging growth sectors such as the Internet of Things and wearables 
before these segments become mainstream. Our Internet of Things revenue grew 19% in 2014, to more than $2 billion. We 
announced our Basis Peak™ fitness and sleep tracker and Intel® Curie™ module, a button-sized computer designed for wearables, 
and have established a growing portfolio of wearable technology collaborations with several world-class fashion and fitness brands. 
Moore’s Law: going strong at 50
In 1965, Intel co-founder Gordon Moore made his visionary observations about how integrated electronics would change our 
world through ever-shrinking, ever-cheaper silicon circuits. Fifty years later, “Moore’s Law” remains Intel’s heritage and is still 
our driving force. In 2014, we launched chips based on the world’s first 14-nanometer (nm) manufacturing process, and our 
10nm process is under development. As we further advance Moore’s Law, our silicon technology leadership will remain a valuable 
competitive advantage. 
Role model for corporate responsibility
Intel continues to be a leader in environmental sustainability, education, and community involvement. In 2014, we extended 
efforts to ensure ethical sourcing of minerals for our products, including “conflict minerals” from the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo (DRC) and adjoining countries. After accomplishing our goal to manufacture microprocessors that are DRC conflict-free  
for tantalum, tin, tungsten, and gold, we have set a new goal that all products on our roadmap for 2016 and beyond will be DRC 
conflict-free for these minerals. In January 2015, we also announced a broad Diversity in Technology initiative that includes our 
commitment to invest $300 million to support hiring and retaining of women and under-represented minorities at Intel and 
throughout the technology and gaming industries.  
It’s best with Intel
We solidified our strategy and executed it well in 2014, resulting in a very strong year for Intel. We sharpened our focus,  
accelerated our pace of innovation, and delivered stockholder return. As we move forward, we will continue our work to  
ensure that if it’s smart and connected, it is best with Intel.

Letter From Your Chairman
Financial Results
2014 was a year of significant and tangible  
progress for Intel.  
The financial achievements described in the CEO’s letter 
reflect the energies of a company that is changing. There  
is a renewed focus on discipline and results, and we are 
executing on our strategy to deliver value to stockholders. 
We have strengthened our resolve to be successful in the 
market and to take informed, appropriate business risks. 
We are determined to heed the lessons of history, adapt  
to changes in our environment, and lead with innovation.
Your Board of Directors has been listening to investor concerns and has taken  
a fresh look at its own responsibilities to stockholders. Our priorities in 2014 
included strategic clarity, cash policy, and Board composition.
The Board has actively engaged in discussions about the strategy behind Intel’s 
investments, to help make sure possible risks and returns for stockholders are 
clearly understood. We have seen progress in unprofitable businesses and are 
encouraged by new investments to capture strategic opportunities. 
In reviewing cash policy, the Board looks first at the needs of the business.  
Most of Intel’s investments focus on advanced technologies critical to business 
success. In 2014, Intel made capital investments of $10.1 billion, the largest 
portion of which was used to build and equip leading-edge manufacturing 
capacity. The company also spent $11.5 billion on research and development. 
About 70% of this was for technical capabilities and intellectual property, the 
costs and benefits of which are shared across Intel’s business segments. This 
broad and deep foundation allows us to integrate functions into the platform 
products that customers increasingly require.
After reviewing plans for the business, the Board considers the dividend and 
then stock repurchases. In 2014, the Board announced the first increase in the 
dividend since 2012, from $0.90 to $0.96 per share. It also authorized an 
acceleration of stock repurchases to return more cash to investors. Intel 
repurchased $10.8 billion worth of Intel stock in 2014, five times the level of 
2013. Through dividends and repurchases, Intel returned cash to stockholders  
in 2014 of $15.2 billion, more than two times the amount in 2013.  
These actions extend Intel’s commitment to deliver long-term value to owners.  
In the last five years, Intel returned $54.2 billion to stockholders through 
dividends and stock repurchases. Since 2009, the dividend has risen from  
$0.56 to $0.96 per share, and average shares outstanding have decreased  
from 5.6 to 5.1 billion shares.
With an eye to Intel’s future, the Board reviewed its composition to make sure  
it has the appropriate skills and experience for stewardship. We added a new 
Board member who brings more than 20 years of experience in enterprise 
software innovation and cloud computing, areas that are key to Intel’s business.
While pointing with pride to accomplishments, we understand there is more to 
do. Many of us are disciples of former Intel CEO and Chairman Andy Grove. In his 
world, there are no victory laps. Every day brings a new challenge, and we must 
never become complacent.
At the same time, the optimism about the future shared by all of Intel’s founders 
remains strong in Intel’s culture. Fifty years after Gordon Moore made his famous 
predictions for the future of integrated electronics, we believe the potential for 
innovation continues to be enormous.
Change is essential for innovation. We must continue to embrace change and 
innovate. Our goal is to continue the foundational technology investments and 
drive Intel’s profitability.
