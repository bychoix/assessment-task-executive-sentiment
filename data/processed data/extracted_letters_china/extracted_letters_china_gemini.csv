Message from the Chairman 
and the CEO 
Message from the Chairman 
and the CEO 
2019 was a pivotal year for our company. 
Not only did we achieve strong fnancial results, but we also took decisive steps to lay the groundwork for future 
growth and proftability as well as to ensure that our company has the scale, expertise and resources to effectively 
navigate through the dramatic transformation our industry is undergoing. 
We want to thank everyone in the FCA organization for their on-going contributions during such an important year. 
Their relentless hard work and professionalism is crucial to our continued success. 
Worldwide combined shipments totaled 4.4 million units and net revenues came in at €108.2 billion. 
We achieved Adjusted EBIT for the year of €6.7 billion, with a margin of 6.2 percent. 
Across our core business operations by region, North America posted record results for the 5th consecutive year, with 
Adjusted EBIT at €6.7 billion and margin at a new high of 9.1 percent. In the United States, the Ram brand reached a 
new sales record and, for the frst time, ranked as the number two brand in the large pickup truck segment. 
We also delivered another year of strong results in LATAM, with Adjusted EBIT up 40 percent to €501 million and 
margin increasing by 150 basis points to 5.9 percent. In Brazil, we regained overall market leadership and fnished the 
year in a leading position in key segments such as SUVs, pickups and light commercial vehicles. 
Results in APAC signifcantly improved, despite continued market challenges. Actions to improve vehicle mix and net 
pricing along with cost savings and restructuring actions signifcantly reduced our loss compared to prior year. 
In EMEA, performance was adversely affected by several factors, including continued commercial challenges and the 
age of our product portfolio in the region. Lower volumes and higher incentives, together with increased compliance 
and product costs, led to a decrease in Adjusted EBIT to near break-even. However, during 2019, we took actions to 
invest in EMEA and improve operating performance. We streamlined headcount and further reduced our cost-base 
in the region. We also continued our focus on moving away from low-margin sales channels. Finally, we announced 
signifcant investments in key new products, which will go a long way towards renewing our product portfolio and 
improving our competitiveness. 
Maserati results - with an Adjusted EBIT loss of €199 million - refected the impact of important actions we took to 
start to re-position the business. During the year, a completely new management team was installed, with key talent 
recruited both internally and externally. We signifcantly reduced dealer stock and committed to key investments to 
renew and expand Maserati’s product offering, with a regular cadence of new product launches, including a signifcant 
level of electrifed powertrains, through 2024. These actions give us a high level of confdence in the future trajectory of 
the Maserati brand. 
The above operating results led the company to achieve a full-year Adjusted net proft of €4.3 billion and net proft from 
continuing operations of €2.7 billion. These results also drove Industrial Free Cash Flows of €2.1 billion. 
On the basis of these strong results, the Board of Directors recommended the payment of an ordinary dividend of €1.1 
billion to our shareholders, as previously indicated. 
Delivering such strong results is important to support the substantial investments we are making in future products, 
technologies and facilities.

Message from the Chairman 
and the CEO 
During 2019 we committed to key projects that are fundamental to our future, and will further strengthen our business 
in the years ahead. 
In the United States, we are investing $4.5 billion to expand the capacity of our facilities in Michigan and build a 
new state-of-the-art plant in Detroit that will open later this year. It’s a commitment that will add 6,500 new jobs in 
Southeast Michigan. 
In Italy, we are executing an ambitious €5 billion plan, centered around electrifcation, with key new products and a 
new Battery Hub located inside our historic Mirafori complex in Turin, that will assemble batteries for our growing 
line-up of electric models. 
In Brazil, we have started a signifcant new investment cycle of R$16 billion (approx. €3.4 billion), which will see a 
renewed product line-up for the Fiat and Jeep brands and add a new state-of-the-art fex-fuel engine plant, which 
will become the largest powertrain hub in Latin America. 
For Maserati, we are executing a major product-led transformation plan including the launch of new white-space 
products as well as several full battery electric and hybridized models. 
Undoubtedly, 2019 was another historic year in the evolution of our company because of the agreement we reached 
with PSA for a 50/50 merger that will create the world’s third largest automaker by revenues and a new global OEM 
equipped to meet the mobility challenges that lie ahead. We expect to close the transaction with PSA by the end of 
this year or in early 2021. In the meantime, we will maintain our focus on the fawless delivery of our commitments. 
Among the other highlights of the year: 
We fnalized the sale of Magneti Marelli, which not only signifcantly strengthened our balance sheet, but also 
allowed the Group to distribute a €2.0 billion extraordinary dividend to our shareholders. 
We strengthened our network of partnerships to develop e-mobility solutions for electric vehicles by executing 
agreements with Enel X and Engie Group in Europe, for both home charging stations and public charging networks. 
With a focus on improving our effciency and speed to market, we streamlined our Global Product Development 
team by bringing together vehicle and powertrain engineering under a single, global organization. 
We entered into an agreement to sell our cast iron components business operated through Teksid; this is another 
important step in the implementation of our supplier business plan and will allow the business to be further 
developed by a leading player in the cast iron industry. 
We also strengthened our product offering with several key launches, including: 
The all-new Ram Heavy Duty, which was awarded Motor Trend’s 2020 Truck of the Year, on the back of the Ram 
Light Duty winning the previous edition of the award. 
The all-new Jeep Gladiator, which was named 2020 North American Truck of the Year and marked the brand’s 
return to the pickup truck market. 
The all-new Jeep Commander PHEV, the frst electrifed vehicle of the global Jeep family, which also represented our 
entry into China’s rapidly-growing New Energy Vehicle market. 
We remain committed to continue to develop our social and environmental responsibilities.

In 2019, we further reduced our environmental footprint on a per-vehicle-produced basis at our plants around the 
world: compared with 2010, we accomplished a nearly 40 percent reduction in water withdrawal, a 27 percent 
reduction in our carbon footprint and a 64 percent reduction in waste generated. 
We strive to enrich the vitality of the communities where we live and work by creating jobs, giving back through 
employee volunteering and providing fnancial support through our charitable initiatives. During 2019, Group 
employees around the world volunteered thousands of hours in support of a wide range of social projects. 
We also aim to offer our employees an inclusive work environment, where everyone feels respected and valued. We 
are proud that our efforts were recognized by organizations such as the Refnitiv Diversity & Inclusion Index in which 
FCA was among the global “Top 25 Most Diverse & Inclusive Companies” in the workplace. 
It was also an important year for initiatives with signifcant positive impact on society. 
2019 marked the 15th anniversary of our Árvore da Vida project in Brazil, which provides educational support for 
young people in Jardim Teresópolis, one of the most impoverished districts in the metropolitan area around the 
Group’s plant in Betim. The program aims to empower families through education and, to date, has helped more than 
20,000 people in the local area. 
As part of our sustainability focus, we also provided signifcant support through the FCA Foundation for an ambitious 
and innovative project supporting scientifc education and outreach to be launched by CERN in Geneva with the 
Science Gateway, which is expected to host more than 300,000 people every year. In such an occasion, the Aula 
Magna will be dedicated to our late CEO, Sergio Marchionne. Students from primary to high-school age, and their 
families, will be able to experience the world of physics and science through interaction and experimentation. 
In conclusion, 2019 saw the Group continue to build on its rich legacy, while at the same time laying the groundwork 
for further transformation and the beginning of another momentous chapter. 
We are committed to ensuring we remain a leading global car company and to building a sustainable business for the 
beneft of all our stakeholders. 
We will continue to be guided by the same values that defne our Group by linking growth and respect, economic 
success and social responsibility, industrial development and environmental awareness. 
We would like to recognize and thank all of our shareholders and stakeholders for your trust, support and 
engagement.

management estimates, market research, publicly available information and industry publications. Market share, 
ranking and other data contained in this report may also be based on our good faith estimates, our own knowledge 
and experience and such other sources as may be available. Market share data may change and cannot always 
be verifed with complete certainty due to limits on the availability and reliability of raw data, the voluntary nature of 
the data-gathering process, different methods used by different sources to collect, assemble, analyze or compute 
market data, including different defnitions of vehicle segments and descriptions and other limitations and uncertainties

Staying the course 
Dear fellow shareholders, 
The turbulent operating environment of the past 
year has only reinforced our commitment to 
Nestlé’s longer-term objectives. Good for You, 
Good for the Planet is at the heart of our strategy. 
Our strong brands, our impactful innovation 
capabilities and our operational execution have 
helped us continue to deliver. 
True to our values 
At the start of 2022, the extreme challenges of the COVID-19 
pandemic seemed to be waning. There were some supply 
chain challenges as well as inflationary pressures but those 
appeared to be manageable. The unexpected invasion 
of Ukraine at the end of February changed the course of 
the year. Global supply chain issues proliferated, inflation 
became rampant, concerns over energy shortages took hold 
and food insecurity grew.
We faced a choice this past year in how to react to these 
challenges. There was little handwringing as it was clear to 
us that we could not lose sight of our long-term strategy: 
we continued to invest in R&D, our brands and sustainability 
initiatives. Increased food insecurity only strengthened 
Nestlé’s commitments to maintaining essential food 
supplies, providing affordable nutrition and advancing 
regenerative food systems. 
To stay on course required a constant rebalancing between 
growth, affordability, and meeting our commitments to 
shareholders and other stakeholders. There were no easy 
solutions, but we did not waver in our resolve to deliver 
on short-term expectations, progress on our long-term 
ambitions and remain true to the core of our strategy: Good 
for You, Good for the Planet. Nestlé’s decentralized five-
zone structure allowed us to be close to our consumers and 
respond to shifts in their needs, while our global, balanced 
and diversified portfolio helped us weather inflation and 
supply chain challenges.
“Increased food insecurity only 
strengthened Nestlé’s commitments 
to maintaining essential food  
supplies, providing affordable 
nutrition and advancing regenerative 
food systems.”

Dependably on track 
Even in a year as challenging as 2022, we continued to deliver. 
We stayed focused on bringing fast-paced innovations to 
market, enhancing our digital capabilities, investing in our 
brands and managing our portfolio. Our real internal growth 
remained robust under challenging conditions.
We adjusted prices to reflect our own growing costs due to 
inflation. However, we did so responsibly, seeking internal 
efficiencies and cost-saving measures to try to limit price 
increases. Nestlé’s role has always been to make nutritious 
food affordable and accessible to people everywhere, 
and we stay committed to that even in times of economic 
headwinds. Highlights from 2022 include the following:
 – Organic growth reached 8.3%, with pricing of 8.2% 
and real internal growth of 0.1%. 
 – Foreign exchange reduced sales by 0.9%. Net 
acquisitions had a positive impact of 1.1%. As a result, 
total reported sales increased by CHF 7.3 billion or 8.4% 
to CHF 94.4 billion. 
 – Underlying trading operating profit (UTOP) margin 
reached 17.1%. The trading operating profit (TOP) 
margin was unchanged versus the prior year at 14.0% 
on a reported basis. As announced at our investor 
seminar, we expect our underlying trading operating 
profit margin to return to a range of 17.5% to 18.5% 
by 2025, following the impact of cost inflation on 
our margin in 2021 and 2022.
 – Underlying earnings per share (EPS) increased 
by 9.4% in constant currency and by 8.4% on a 
reported basis to CHF 4.80. We expect to deliver 
an underlying EPS growth target range of 6% 
to 10% in constant currency. Earnings per share 
decreased by 43.5% to CHF 3.42 on a reported basis, 
mainly reflecting the gain on the disposal of L’Oréal 
shares in 2021.
 – Free cash flow was CHF 6.6 billion, as working 
capital increased temporarily in the context of supply 
chain constraints and capital expenditure remained 
at an elevated level. We expect to trend toward free 
cash flow of 12% of sales and ROIC of 15% by 2025.

Strategic portfolio management 
In 2022, we continued to invest in high-growth categories 
that contribute to our Nutrition, Health and Wellness 
strategy. Nestlé remains disciplined in its approach to 
portfolio management, looking for strategic and cultural fit, 
as well as attractive financial returns.
We remain focused on driving sustained profitable growth 
in the coffee category with the announced acquisition of 
Seattle’s Best Coffee brand from Starbucks. In addition to 
Starbucks packaged coffees sold by Nestlé under the Global 
Coffee Alliance, Seattle’s Best Coffee will join Nestlé’s roster 
of beloved coffee brands in the United States including 
Nescafé, Nespresso and Blue Bottle. 
We continue to develop Nestlé Health Science’s leadership 
position in nutrition and health, sharpening the focus 
on Consumer Care and Medical Nutrition. In 2022, 
we acquired a majority stake in Orgain as well as the 
businesses of Puravida and The Better Health Company. 
The new brands expand our markets in the vitamins, 
minerals and supplements segment in the United States, 
Latin America and Oceania. At the same time, we decided 
to explore strategic options for Palforzia, the peanut allergy 
treatment, following slower than expected adoption by 
patients and healthcare professionals.
Innovating to unlock the power of food
Building a pipeline of highly differentiated innovations, 
while rapidly testing and launching new ideas, fuels 
our growth. Our focus is on delivering tasty, nutritious, 
affordable and sustainable products by anticipating 
growing trends and meeting people’s diverse evolving 
needs and preferences, while investing in solutions with an 
improved environmental footprint. In 2022, we were able 
to maintain the same time-to-market speed as in 2021, 
despite the challenging environment.
infant formula with HMOs had CHF 1.3 billion in sales with 
double-digit growth.
Coffee. We are innovating novel systems that bring the 
perfect cup of coffee to consumers in a sustainable way. 
Nescafé Dolce Gusto Neo gives coffee lovers the best coffee-
shop-at-home experience with three brewing methods and 
compostable paper-based pods. Nespresso will also roll out 
a new range of compostable paper-based capsules that are 
retro-compatible with Nespresso Original machines, while 
Nespresso Vertuo Pop offers the smartest, smallest, most 
optimized and accessible coffee machine ever, made from 
35% recycled plastic.
Plant-based. Market demand for plant-based products 
continues to create opportunities for new offerings across 
the entire food and beverage portfolio, which contribute to 
our sustainability goals. An early focus into a wide variety of 
plant-based alternatives and a retail focus on ready-made 
meals has proven to be a winning strategy. Recent launches 
include Gerber Plant-tastic, soy-based Milo, KitKat V, Garden 
Gourmet Voie Gras and Malher Huevo Más. Plant-based 
products generated sales of around CHF 1 billion in 2022, 
posting high single-digit organic growth.
Accelerated digitalization 
Data and technology are an essential source of competitive 
advantage and Nestlé continues its data-driven digital 
transformation. We are building a seamless consumer 
experience and channel-less commerce system, unlocking 
value via consumer data across geographies and categories. 
E-commerce sales grew by 9.2% to account for 15.8% of total 
Group sales. We remain on track to hit 25% by 2025.
Artificial intelligence and remote assistance are allowing us 
to be more agile and flexible in our manufacturing sites and 
supply chains – more important now than ever.
Infant nutrition. We continue to develop science-based 
nutritional solutions for infants. The newly launched infant 
formula with Nutrilearn Connect, a unique nutrient blend to 
increase brain myelination, and rollout of our infant formulas 
with five human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) to support 
gut health and immunity exemplify this focus. In 2022, 
Creating Shared Value 
Creating Shared Value has always been fundamental to 
the way we do business at Nestlé. We have long believed 
that our company can only be successful in the long term 
by creating value for both our shareholders and society. For 
decades, our activities and products have aimed to make 
4

a positive difference to society in order to foster Nestlé’s 
ongoing success. We have not wavered in that commitment 
in the face of short-term challenges this year.
the HSR system. Nestlé is the first company to disclose the 
nutritional value of its entire portfolio.
Net Zero Roadmap. We have made good progress on our 
Net Zero Roadmap, which was strongly supported by our 
shareholders at the 2021 Annual General Meeting. We have 
already passed peak carbon, with greenhouse gas emissions 
below the 2018 baseline. From 2024, we will vote annually on 
a comprehensive report on our non-financial performance, 
including our climate-related agenda. Our commitment to 
advancing regenerative food systems supports this agenda. 
We are supporting farmers in their transition to regeneration 
through the Nescafé Plan 2030 and our income accelerator 
program for cocoa-farming families.
“For decades, our activities and 
products have aimed to make a positive 
difference to society in order to foster 
Nestlé’s ongoing success. We have not 
wavered in that commitment in the 
face of short-term challenges this year.”
Affordable nutrition. Our offering of affordable and accessible 
products aims to provide lower-income consumers with 
high-quality food products that deliver nutritional value at 
an affordable cost and in an appropriate format. Most of our 
affordable and accessible offering is fortified with at least one 
of the “big four” micronutrients: iron, iodine, vitamin A and 
zinc. In 2022, we provided 129.2 billion fortified servings of 
affordable nutrition products.
Good for You. In 2022, we made a commitment to increase 
the transparency of the nutritional value of our global 
portfolio. For the first time, we benchmarked our entire 
global portfolio against the Health Star Rating (HSR) system 
– a nutrient profiling system used by the Access to Nutrition 
Initiative – and have given an overview of our wide range 
of specialized nutrition products, which are not covered by 
Refined Board oversight 
Our Board of Directors continued to provide valuable 
guidance on our strategy, business performance and 
sustainability agenda. We maintained our practice of adding 
diverse experience and expertise through the appointment 
of two new independent directors. In recent years we have, 
in particular, strengthened the Board’s expertise on food 
systems, food and beverage, digitalization, marketing, 
sustainability and other topics. 
During 2022, the Board further refined the governance 
framework related to our sustainability agenda, including 
the annual work plan of the dedicated Sustainability 
Committee, which advises on all aspects of the Group’s 
environmental and social sustainability, including our 
efforts on climate change, human rights, and diversity 
and inclusion.
Consistently committed to our purpose 
We are committed to creating shared value for our 
shareholders and all stakeholders connected to our business 
by unlocking the power of food to enhance quality of life. 
We could not do this without the loyalty of our employees, 
business partners and investors. In this challenging year, 
we thank our employees for their admirable dedication in 
keeping us on track while rebalancing. We are also grateful 
for the support of our business partners, our consumers 
and the communities where we operate. We thank you, 
our shareholders, for your continued trust in us to stay 
the course.

 – Commit to ambitious sustainability goals to advance the 
health of the planet, drive societal progress and support 
sustainable, healthy food systems.
Our long-term value creation model is based on the 
balanced pursuit of top- and bottom-line growth as well as 
improved capital efficiency. We create value guided by three 
strategic pillars:
 – Growth through continuous innovation.  
 – Operational efficiency. 
 – Resource and capital allocation with discipline  
and clear priorities, including through acquisitions 
and divestitures.
Sustained organic sales growth  
We maintain a diversified portfolio, both in terms of geography 
and category. Our agility in changing environments and 
cultivation of our global, regional and local brands contribute 
to long-term financial performance. Our objective is to 
sustain a mid single-digit organic growth rate through rapid 
innovation, market share gains and portfolio management. 
We compete in attractive and growing categories, and 
prioritize investments to stay relevant and win in every 
segment and market in which we operate. Our digital 
technologies help us identify emerging consumer needs and 
business model opportunities so we can bring differentiated 
innovation to market fast. We partner with customers 
across the retail landscape to adapt our product portfolio 
and channel strategies, leveraging our global brands to 
customize new products for local tastes and preferences.  
In 2022:
 – 31 of our trusted brands, including Maggi, Milo and 
Nido, generated over CHF 1 billion each in annual sales 
at the retail level.
 – E-commerce sales represented 15.8% of sales and 
grew by 9.2%, and our digital marketing spend 
increased to 55%. 
 – Our premium offerings represented around 30% 
of sales and grew at a high single-digit rate. 
 – Plant-based products generated sales of around 
CHF 1 billion, posting high single-digit organic growth.
 – Emerging markets represented 42% of sales and 
grew by 10%.
 – Sales of affordable, accessible products – many nutrient-
fortified – accounted for around 18% of emerging market 
sales and grew at a double-digit rate.
We focus on categories and geographies with attractive 
dynamics where Nestlé has an ability to win. Since 2017, we 
have completed or announced more than 100 transactions 
(acquisitions and divestitures) with annual sales equivalent 
to around 22% of 2017 Group sales. 
In 2022, these included:  
 – Purchase of a majority stake in Orgain, a US leader in 
plant-based nutrition, with the option to fully acquire 
Orgain in 2024. 
 – Acquisition of Puravida, a premium Brazilian nutrition 
and health lifestyle brand, expanding the consumer 
health portfolio in Latin America. 
 – Acquisition of The Better Health Company in New 
Zealand, which includes the GO Healthy brand and 
New Zealand Health Manufacturing, expanding Nestlé 
Health Science’s portfolio of vitamins, minerals and 
supplements in AOA.
 – Acquisition of the Seattle’s Best Coffee brand from 
Starbucks. 
 – Creating a partnership with L Catterton to bring together 
Freshly and Kettle Cuisine.
 – Divestment of Gerber Good Start.

In 2022, Nestlé 
acquired a majority 
stake in Orgain, 
a leader in organic, 
plant-based nutrition 
in the United States, 
with a foundation in 
science, great taste 
and broad appeal.
We take decisive action to restore growth and profitability 
when businesses underperform. Nestlé has decided to 
explore strategic options for Palforzia, the peanut allergy 
treatment, following slower than expected adoption by 
patients and healthcare professionals. The review is  
expected to be completed in the first half of 2023. Going 
forward, Nestlé Health Science will sharpen its focus on 
Consumer Care and Medical Nutrition.
We have formed a partnership with L Catterton to bring together 
Freshly and Kettle Cuisine, a leading manufacturer of fresh 
artisanal foods for retail and foodservice customers. L Catterton 
will be the majority owner, with Nestlé holding a minority stake.
Operating more efficiently 
We fuel our growth agenda through disciplined cost 
management, improving operational efficiency at all levels 
of the business. Alongside sales growth, this approach 
enables us to free up resources for reinvestment in product 
innovation, brand building, digitalization and sustainability 
initiatives, while creating value for our shareholders. Internal 
efficiency projects help us free up resources for investments 
by optimizing our skills and enhancing effectiveness and 
speed of our organization.
We continued to adapt our organization to be more agile, 
flexible and digitalized. In manufacturing, we continued to 
upgrade our operational footprint in 2022, increasing factory 
fixed overheads by around 6%. In procurement, increased 
global buying combined with a reduced number of product 
specifications helped us reduce costs and complexity. 
Global buying through our three purchasing hubs was 68% 
in 2022. In our administration, we continued to simplify and 
standardize processes. 
As a percentage of sales based on a 5-quarter rolling 
average, working capital increased to 1.9% in 2022 due to 
our conscious decision to temporarily increase inventory 
levels. This decision, taken in the context of significant 
supply chain disruptions and the energy crisis in Europe, 
reflects our commitment to ensure continuity of supply.
Prudent allocation of capital 
Our priorities are to invest in the long-term growth and 
development of our business, while increasing shareholder 
returns and creating shared value. Nestlé pursues a value 
creation model that balances growth in earnings per share, 
competitive shareholder returns, flexibility for external 
growth and access to financial markets. We will continue 
to invest to drive brand building, innovation, digitalization 
and sustainability.
Investing for the long term includes R&D investment, 
brand support and capital expenditure to support organic 
profitable growth. We focus on projects with the highest 
potential to create economic profit. We are accelerating our 
capital expenditure plans for our fast-growing categories, 
particularly coffee and pet care.
We are disciplined when it comes to mergers and acquisitions 
in order to protect our ROIC. We have a thorough project 
governance in place, with clear accountability and targets.

both society and our shareholders at a meaningful scale.  
We do so because we believe that business should act as 
a force for good. 
We have demonstrated our commitment to maintaining 
a high level of reinvestment into the business while at 
the same time continually increasing capital returns to 
shareholders. We do this by increasing our dividend year 
after year. Based on our 2022 performance, the Board of 
Directors has proposed a dividend increase of 15 centimes 
to CHF 2.95 per share to be paid in April 2023. This 
will be our 28th consecutive annual dividend increase. 
As a result of our strong free cash flow generation and 
business disposals, we continued to return excess cash 
to shareholders through share buybacks. In 2022, Nestlé 
repurchased 92 million of its shares for a total amount of 
CHF 10.6 billion at an average price of CHF 115.36 per share. 
Nestlé plans to repurchase CHF 20 billion of its shares over 
the period 2022 to 2024. 
Creating Shared Value: The way we operate

global resources with local know-how to create value for 
Nestlé continues to follow through on our commitments to 
do business in a way that creates shared value, illustrated 
by progress toward net zero greenhouse gas emissions, 
regenerative agriculture, 100% deforestation-free supply

our portfolio.

Food provides essential nutrients to support the good 
health of people and pets, in a tasty and pleasurable 
way. It is a vital pillar of cultures, brings people 
together, underpins economies and impacts planet 
health. At Nestlé, through our R&D organization, we 
innovate with purpose to unlock the power of food and 
deliver tasty, nutritious, affordable and sustainable 
products – for today, and for generations to come. 
nutrition, sustainability and affordability in an increasingly 
complex innovation environment.
To go from idea to shop in six months – with new sites 
in Chile, China, India and Arlington, Virginia, in the 
United States – we now have 14 R+D Accelerators. 
Since 2019, the Accelerator initiative has had over 
300 participants, with 150 new products in 20 countries. 
Our innovation capabilities 
We continuously strengthen our innovation capabilities to 
ensure that we deliver products that meet people’s diverse 
evolving needs, while reducing our carbon footprint and 
contributing to company growth. In 2022, we were able 
to maintain the same time-to-market speed as in 2021, 
despite the challenging environment.
Through our regional R&D centers in Africa, China, India 
and South-East Asia, we can innovate closer to the 
people we serve with agility. We recently inaugurated 
an additional regional R&D Center for Latin America in 
Santiago, Chile, enabling us to innovate for consumers 
in the region, while leveraging our global science and 
technology capabilities to deliver tasty, nutritious, 
affordable and sustainable products. 
We also rely on new innovation tools to increase speed, 
efficiency and decision making, and deliver breakthrough 
solutions. Using advanced algorithms, we can capture 
information on trends, ingredients, flavors and health 
benefits to virtually create and quickly test concepts 
before further refining for launch. Using these tools, 
in China we launched Nescafé Dalgona coffee mixes 
and Nesvita probiotic supplements for adults. We are 
also exploring the use of artificial intelligence and data 
science that can help to manage tradeoffs between taste, 
Using a test-and-learn approach and working closely with 
retailers, we quickly develop and pilot novel concepts before 
investing in a full-scale launch. After a successful pilot test 
for KitKat V, we launched the vegan chocolate on a wider 
scale in 15 European markets.
Nutrition solutions across life stages 
We develop innovations that are backed by science across 
life stages, for people and pets. New research showed 
that Nutrilearn Connect, a unique nutrient blend, increases 
brain myelination, a process vital for cognition and motor 
development during early life. This led to a first launch 
in Hong Kong and China under the Wyeth S-26 Ultima 
brand. We also continued the rollout in 20 markets of infant 
formula with five HMOs to support gut health and immunity.
To meet toddlers’ unique nutritional needs, we introduced 
Gerber Powerblend cereals in China and India. These 
are made from diverse food groups such as whole grains, 
legumes, milk and fruits to support immunity, brain 
development and the gut microbiome.
Providing solutions for people with specific health needs 
is also a priority for us. To support women during and after 
pregnancy while breastfeeding, we launched a range of 
Materna multivitamins and supplements in Latin America 
and Europe. 
Our new regional 
R&D Center for Latin 
America in Santiago, 
Chile, enables us 
to innovate tasty, 
nutritious, affordable 
and sustainable 
products that are 
highly relevant to 
local consumers.
In the United States, we developed 
a range of Compleat plant-based 
standard tube feeding formulas to 
support digestive health, increased 
energy needs or decreased fluid needs 
in patients aged 1 to 13 years. In China, 
we launched Yiyang milk powder made 
with mulberry leaf extract, a traditional 
Chinese ingredient, to support people 
aged over 45 years in managing 
blood glucose.
For cats and dogs, we launched Purina 
Pro Plan supplements – in a multi-
format such as oils, powders and 
tablets – to support mobility, immunity, 
vitality, healthy skin and coat.

My Fellow Shareholders
April 2011
This past year, the world continued to recover from the financial crisis and adapt to the 
changing dynamics among developed and emerging markets. Equity and bond markets 
extended their rally, but were highly volatile in the face of ongoing sovereign debt concerns, 
dissension over fiscal, monetary and foreign exchange policies, and uncertain and uneven 
growth prospects. While excess supply continued to plague the U.S. housing market, home 
prices in China soared amid worries of new asset bubbles in the fast growing emerging 
markets. Demand for commodities remained robust and gold appreciated sharply, enjoying 
its renewed status as a preferred store of wealth. Although investors took tentative steps to 
re-risk their portfolios with allocations to bonds, index equities and emerging markets, bank 
deposits and cash balances remained exceptionally high.

my fellow shaReholdeRs:
for 26 years, BlackRock has dedicated itself to helping clients build 
better fi  nancial futures. today, those clients trust us to manage 
more money than any other investment fi  rm in the world. and we 
believe that BlackRock’s differentiated offering — combining a full 
range of active and index strategies with a strong risk management 
culture — has never been more essential than it is now.
Financial, technological and social changes are remaking 
the global economy and the way capital fl  ows through it. 
Divergence is increasing, as nations around the world follow 
different trajectories in economic growth, monetary policy, 
asset prices and currency valuations. Central bank actions, 
political events and disruption in the energy market are driving 
volatility in global fi nancial markets while also creating the 
potential for new risks. Technology is changing the way we live 
and spend. And longevity is driving demographic upheaval.

2014 revenue was $11.1 billion, with operating income, as 
adjusted, of $4.6 billion, up 9% and 13%, respectively, versus 
2013. Earnings per share, as adjusted, rose 17% year over 
year, and since 2007 (the fi nal year of pre-crisis earnings), 
BlackRock has grown earnings per share, as adjusted, by 142%, 
versus 76% for the S&P 500 and 9% for the S&P Financials. 
Since our founding in 1988, BlackRock has never wavered 
in acting as a fi  duciary for our clients. This year’s annual 
report explores how BlackRock continues to fulfi ll that 
mission — and lay a foundation for long-term growth — 
by continuing to build a strong and agile platform that can 
anticipate change and adapt ahead of a shifting economic 
and fi nancial landscape, without compromising our 
relentless focus on risk management and performance 
for our clients.

At BlackRock, we are constantly looking at the world — 
and at ourselves — to assess whether our products, our 
services and our strategies can meet the challenges that 
tomorrow will present. The disruptions that occurred or 
crystallized in 2014 — in technology, fi nancial markets, and 
longevity and retirement — are having a major impact on 
how we and our clients live, work and invest.
A Divergent World
Today’s investors are faced with a diverse set of challenges 
roiling global markets. Interest rates remain at historically 
low (or even negative) levels, central bank policy continues 
to outweigh market fundamentals, currency volatility has 
spiked and we are seeing dramatic shifts in oil prices. 
The Federal Reserve is setting the stage for higher interest 
rates in the U.S., but the low-for-long theme remains 
pervasive. The European Central Bank, by contrast, is 
pursuing quantitative easing, pushing European bond yields 
into negative territory. Given the lack of effective fi scal policy 
by governments, the European Central Bank’s steps will be 
critical in buying Europe the time it needs to heal and grow.

However, while these actions are keeping borrowing costs 
low, they are also impacting how investors are saving for  
the future, forcing them to take increasing risk as core bond 
allocations are insufficient to meet the growing liability 
burdens of pension funds, insurers and retirees. 
Politicians, central bankers and regulators have rightly 
identified asset-price bubbles as a serious source of risk,  
yet the unintended consequences of aggressive monetary 
policy are the biggest driver of such bubbles today. Yield-
starved investors attempting to meet future liabilities are 
turning to lower-rated credits and longer-duration assets. 
Not only is this driving prices ever higher in certain asset 
categories, but it is also contributing to greater portfolio 
concentration in more volatile areas of the market than 
historical norms.
The situation is worsening every day, as the pool of funds  
in search of returns grows larger. To meet the needs of  
longer lives and soaring healthcare costs, for example, 
companies are stepping up contributions to their pension 
funds. For the same reasons, individuals are adding to  
their defined contribution accounts. And insurers are writing 
new policies, whose premiums need to be invested to meet 
future liabilities. Today’s pre-retirees in particular face a stark 
set of choices: put their cash in the bank at a near-zero or 
negative yield, search in vain for a capital-starved insurer who 
can provide a guaranteed income product, or step further  
out onto the risk curve at a time when they should be seeking 
income rather than capital appreciation. 
This mix of growing assets and shrinking yields is creating  
a dangerous imbalance. Yet monetary policy makers seem 
insufficiently attuned to the conundrum their actions are 
creating for investors: reach for yield and continue to fuel  
an expanding bubble, or remain on the sidelines and watch 
unfunded liabilities grow unchecked. This increasingly 
desperate search for yield is now the greatest source of 
prudential risk in the financial system — and one that central 
bankers and regulators ignore at our collective peril if they 
hope to truly reduce risk in the system. 
In addition to their impact on interest rates and risk markets, 
divergent monetary policies also are creating volatile

conditions in currency markets. The specter of a U.S. rate 
hike has exerted upward pressure on the dollar, while the 
euro is exhibiting extraordinary weakness. 
Since peaking in the early 2000s, the U.S. dollar index 
weakened by more than 40% through the fi nancial crisis in 
2008, helping to form a critical piece of the foundation for the 
U.S. to increase global competitiveness and emerge from 
recession. Since last July, the dollar has given back much 
of that competitive advantage, strengthening by 25% versus 
a basket of global currencies over only a matter of months 
as divergent economic conditions and central bank actions 
have sent currency markets into one of the most volatile 
periods on record. 
And while fi rst the yen and more recently the euro have 
made headlines, emerging market currencies have in some 
cases experienced an even greater impact — with the value 
of the Brazilian real falling by more than half in the past 
four years (and more than 30% since just mid-2014) and the 
Mexican peso sitting at an all-time low versus the U.S. dollar. 
These shifts will have a marked infl  uence on global capital 
fl  ows and investment, and correctly identifying winners 
and losers will materially infl  uence portfolio returns. 
In particular, the relative valuation of the U.S. dollar is now 
having a rapid and material impact on U.S. companies and 
their ability to compete in a global market. While the U.S. 
economy as a whole is not overly exposed to exports, many 
of our largest and most infl  uential companies are. We believe 
that this will lead to an erosion in confi dence on the part 
of CEOs, with the potential to slow both investment decisions 
and future growth in the U.S.
In addition to divergent monetary policy and shifting exchange 
rates, the new paradigm for oil prices will contribute to 
continued volatility. 
Cheap oil will act as a sizable tax cut for the global economy, 
potentially leading to a major redistribution of wealth. But 
the effects will not be uniform: high-cost energy production 
economies are experiencing headwinds; countries like 
the U.S., China and India are experiencing the benefi  ts of 
stimulus; and countries that have seen currency devaluation

in recent months are experiencing more modest gains. 
More shocks can be expected as production decisions and 
the demand side seek equilibrium, but ultimately lower 
energy prices should benefi t the global economy. 
Technological Transformations
In the 1990s, the world spoke of change driven by information 
technology as occurring at “Internet speed.” Today, the 
snowballing effects of technology are making that pace 
seem glacial by comparison.
One example of how technology fosters rapid market 
transformation is the abrupt rise of the “sharing economy” — 
companies such as Uber, ZipCar or China’s Kuaidi. 
Convenience is the obvious benefi t of services such as these, 
but over time they will also infl uence major consumer spending 
decisions, and in turn, capital fl ows. Low-cost taxi options or 
car-sharing services, for example, are making car ownership 
less necessary. Home-rental services like Airbnb are eating 
into hotel revenues and simultaneously turning homes into 
income-generating assets. Crowdfunding and peer-to-peer 
lending are providing entirely new avenues for raising capital. 
While the long-term effects of these trends are diffi cult 
to predict, there is no question that the sharing economy is 
reshaping the way capital moves through the system. 
These popular new consumer technologies attract a great 
deal of attention, but technology’s impact on such traditional 
sectors of the economy as energy, agriculture and manu-
facturing is perhaps even more profound. The recent fall in 
oil prices was driven in large part by technology, as new 
exploration and extraction technologies accelerated supply 
ahead of demand. In response, the number of oil rigs 
operating in the U.S. has fallen by nearly half in just the past 
four months, yet output continues to rise as larger and 
higher-yielding shale wells drive record production. U.S. 
crude inventories are now at their highest seasonal levels in 
80 years, sparking concerns about storage capacity. 
In the agricultural sector, Dow Chemical recently developed 
a new technology improving how fertilizer bonds with soil. 
Although this development has received far less attention 
than Uber or fracking, its potential long-term impact is 
just as signifi cant, and perhaps even greater. This innovation 
will reduce nitrogen leaching, dramatically lessening the 
environmental impact of agriculture. Farmers will apply 
fertilizer less frequently, increasing productivity and ultimately 
creating effi ciencies for end consumers. 
Technology also remains a critical factor in our own industry, 
speeding and democratizing access to information, enabling 
investors to react to sudden shifts in the markets driven 
by divergence and technology and creating demand for a 
higher quality client experience.
Perhaps no area is more affected by technology today than 
jobs. Factories are increasingly staffed by robots, not 
laborers. Drones may soon deliver our packages or even our 
meals. As automation drives extraordinary increases in 
productivity, millions of workers globally are being displaced, 
with the burden falling disproportionately on lower-skilled 
workers and new entrants to the job market. And in a 
global economy, the pressure to educate and train a skilled 
workforce has never been more intense. 
Longevity and Retirement 
Automation is not the only challenge workers are grappling with 
in a changing world. They must also confront one of the 
defi ning social and economic challenges of our age: preparing 
for longer lives. 
The effects of longevity are multifaceted. Longevity will 
reshape the job market, as younger workers fi nd it more and 
more diffi cult to enter the workforce. It will dramatically alter 
the nature and cost of healthcare, as the number of high-
cost patients grows. But most of all, longevity will require 
people and governments across the world to take a new 
approach to retirement — to encourage, or even mandate, 
widespread savings. 
Longer lifespans mean a greater savings burden, and the world 
is woefully underprepared. According to BlackRock’s Global 
Investor Pulse Survey, 69% of investors globally worry they 
won’t be able to live comfortably in retirement. 
The cost of living longer is coinciding with divergent economic 
prospects, low yields and modest growth. Adding to the 
problem, people all over the world are underinvested — if 
they are invested at all — while governments face diverse 
policy challenges. 
Nations with overly generous pension plans risk not being 
able to fulfi ll their obligations. Those with no support for their 
retirees could face immense poverty, a growing drain on 
resources and civil unrest. Even nations in the middle, like the 
U.S., have millions of people underinvested and overly 
dependent on Social Security — which was not designed 
to support widespread longevity. Countries that meet this 
daunting challenge head-on will come to lead the next 
century. Countries that shrink from it do so at great risk. 
InvestIng In the fIRm’s futuRe
Twenty-six years ago, we founded BlackRock with the 
belief that even in an established industry like fi  xed income 
investing, we could succeed with a new approach — a 
dedication to assessing risk and an obsession with building 
the best technology to help us do it. In the ensuing years, 
we combined our depth of analysis, driven by technological 
innovation, with an ever-widening range of long-term 
solutions to provide more and more clients a reason to 
come to BlackRock.
It worked because we have never stopped innovating. We have 
always looked for ways to invest in improving our technology, 
our approach to risk management and our ability to meet our 
clients’ needs. At the core is a recognition that we cannot 
coast on reputation, past successes or size, but must engage 
in an ongoing process of reinvention. 
Today, in the face of the many obstacles making our clients’ 
near- and long-term investment objectives more complex, 
we continue to look every day for new ways to invest in the fi rm 
to better meet their needs.

Financial Review
Pfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
Competition Among Branded Products
Many of our products face competition in the form of branded products, which treat similar diseases or indications. These competitive 
pressures can have an adverse impact on our results of operations.
The Global Economic Environment
In addition to the industry-specific factors discussed above, we, like other businesses, continue to face the effects of the challenging economic 
environment, which have impacted our biopharmaceutical operations in the U.S. and Europe, including the countries that use the euro, 
affecting the performance of products such as Lyrica, Enbrel, Prevnar 13/Prevenar 13 and Celebrex, and in a number of emerging markets. 
We believe that patients, experiencing the effects of the challenging economic environment, including high unemployment levels, and 
increases in co-pays, sometimes switch to generic products, delay treatments, skip doses or use less effective treatments to reduce their 
costs. Challenging economic conditions in the U.S. also have increased the number of patients in the Medicaid program, under which sales of 
pharmaceuticals are subject to substantial rebates and, in many states, to formulary restrictions limiting access to brand-name drugs, including 
ours. In addition, we continue to experience pricing pressure in various markets around the world, including in developed European markets, 
Japan and in a number of emerging markets, with government-mandated reductions in prices for certain biopharmaceutical products and 
government-imposed access restrictions in certain countries.
Significant portions of our revenues and earnings are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. We seek to manage our foreign 
exchange risk in part through operational means, including managing same-currency revenues in relation to same-currency costs and same-
currency assets in relation to same-currency liabilities. Depending on market conditions, foreign exchange risk also is managed through the 
use of derivative financial instruments and foreign currency debt. As we operate in multiple foreign currencies, including the euro, the 
Japanese yen, the U.K. pound, the Chinese renminbi, the Canadian dollar and approximately 100 other currencies, changes in those 
currencies relative to the U.S. dollar will impact our revenues and expenses. If the U.S. dollar weakens against a specific foreign currency, our 
revenues will increase, having a positive impact, and our overall expenses will increase, having a negative impact, on net income. Likewise, if 
the U.S. dollar strengthens against a specific foreign currency, our revenues will decrease, having a negative impact, and our overall expenses 
will decrease, having a positive impact on net income. Therefore, significant changes in foreign exchange rates can impact our results and our 
financial guidance.
Despite the challenging financial markets, Pfizer maintains a strong financial position. Due to our significant operating cash flows, financial 
assets, access to capital markets and available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements, we continue to believe that we have the ability 
to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. Our long-term debt is rated investment grade by both Standard & Poor’s (S&P) and 
Moody’s Investors Service. As market conditions change, we continue to monitor our liquidity position. We have taken and will continue to take 
a conservative approach to our financial investments. Both short-term and long-term investments consist primarily of high-quality, highly liquid, 
well-diversified, available-for-sale debt securities. For further discussion of our financial condition, see the “Analysis of Financial Condition, 
Liquidity and Capital Resources” section of this Financial Review.
Our Strategy
We believe that our medicines provide significant value for both healthcare providers and patients, not only from the improved treatment of 
diseases but also from a reduction in other healthcare costs, such as emergency room or hospitalization costs, as well as improvements in 
health, wellness and productivity. We continue to actively engage in dialogues about the value of our products and how we can best work with 
patients, physicians and payers to prevent and treat disease and improve outcomes. We will work within the current legal and pricing 
structures, as well as continue to review our pricing arrangements and contracting methods with payers, to maximize access to patients and 
minimize any adverse impact on our revenues.
On November 30, 2012, we completed the sale of our Nutrition business to Nestlé. On February 6, 2013, we completed the sale of 
approximately 19.8% of our ownership stake in Zoetis through an initial public offering. We may in the future make a tax-free distribution to our 
shareholders of all or a portion of our remaining equity interest in Zoetis, which may include one or more distributions effected as a dividend to 
all Pfizer shareholders, one or more distributions in exchange for Pfizer shares or other securities, or any combination thereof. We will 
consider all alternatives to maximize the after-tax return for our shareholders, including a tax-free distribution to our shareholders.  If pursued, 
any disposition would be subject to various conditions, including receipt of any necessary regulatory or other approvals and the existence of 
satisfactory market conditions. 
If we decide to fully separate Zoetis, then, following such separation, Pfizer will be a global biopharmaceutical company with an innovative 
core (our Primary Care, Specialty Care and Oncology units) and a value core (our Established Products unit) in developed markets, with 
different cost structures and operating drivers. Our Emerging Markets unit has a geographic focus that includes both the innovative and value 
cores in those markets. The innovative core includes a portfolio of innovative, largely patent-protected, in-line products and an R&D 
organization focused on continuing to build a robust pipeline of highly differentiated product candidates in areas of unmet medical needs. The 
value core includes a portfolio of products that have lost exclusivity or are approaching the loss of exclusivity that help meet the global need 
for less expensive, quality medicines. In addition, we have a complementary Consumer Healthcare business with several well-known brands.
In response to the challenging operating environment, we have taken and continue to take many steps to strengthen our Company and better 
position ourselves for the future. We believe in a comprehensive approach to our challenges—organizing our business to maximize research, 
development and commercial opportunities, improving the performance of our innovative core, making the right capital allocation decisions, 
and protecting our intellectual property.

We are on a deliberate 
journey to unlock Citi’s  
full potential, and we  
have made some bold  
decisions over the last  
year to ensure we succeed.
We know our journey will have its challenges. Whilst some of 
our businesses continued to eclipse their peers in the industry, 
others did not meet our expectations. We also faced challenges 
in aspects of our work to strengthen our data and regulatory 
reporting, an area we are committed to getting right.
Despite some of the headwinds we faced, we continue to stay 
the course and strongly believe in the deliberate path we set at 
Investor Day in 2022. We said this was a multi-year journey and 
we will face challenges as we execute. Nonetheless, the changes 
we have made to the firm and the discipline and accountability 
we put in place over the past few years will allow us to truly 
transform our company for the long term. 
We are still firmly on track to meet the medium-term financial 
targets we set at Investor Day, including achieving an 11-12% 
Return on Tangible Common Equity (RoTCE)1. Our business 
model is resilient and well-diversified. Our balance sheet 
is strong. We have ample liquidity and capital. We remain 
confident in our ability to generate higher returns over the long 
term and return capital to shareholders.
Our business performance
A number of notable items that occurred during a 
disappointing fourth quarter negatively impacted our earnings 
for 2023. We delivered $9.2 billion in net income on revenues 
of $78.5 billion. Our RoTCE2 was 4.9%. Still, we met our full-
year expense guidance and increased our Common Equity 
Tier 1 Capital ratio to approximately 13.4%. We grew tangible 
book value per share2 by 6% to $86.19 and returned roughly 
$6 billion in capital to shareholders in the form of common 
dividends and share repurchases.
At Investor Day, we laid out a clear, compelling vision for the 
firm: to be the preeminent banking partner for institutions with 
cross-border needs, a global leader in wealth management 
and a valued personal bank in our home market. We’ve been 
executing a strategy to bring this vision to life through our five 
interconnected businesses — Services, Markets, Banking, 
Wealth and U.S. Personal Banking.
Our Services business had a record year in 2023 as we 
maintained our leadership in Treasury and Trade Solutions 
(TTS), with client wins up 27% and cross-border transactions 
up 15%. In Securities Services, we had roughly $25 trillion 
in assets under custody and administration, up 13% during 
2023. And we continued to relentlessly innovate for our clients 
with products such as 24/7 USD Clearing, Payments Express 
and Citi Token Services, which enable clients to facilitate 
cross-border payments and access automated trade finance 
solutions around the clock.
Our Markets business delivered a solid performance for the year 
with good underlying momentum in Equities and continued 
growth in Prime balances. We retained a leading position in 
Fixed Income and further optimized our model with the exit 
of marginal businesses. Overall, Markets revenues decreased 
6% from a very strong performance in 2022. As we look ahead, 
our franchise remains well positioned with both corporate and 
investor clients, and we continue to take actions to improve 
returns by allocating capital to products that meet client 
demand and generate a strong return profile. 
Banking remains a key part of our strategy. Whilst revenues for 
the business fell 15% in 2023, largely driven by a weaker wallet 
globally, we are focused on improving wallet share in the near 
term. Our M&A business experienced significant momentum 
in the back half of 2023. Throughout the year, we led on 
several global transactions larger than $10 billion. We have 
also reorganized our three lines of business — Investment 
Banking, Corporate Banking and Commercial Banking — 
under one umbrella to strengthen synergies amongst them. 
We look forward to welcoming Vis Raghavan later this year 
to lead the franchise and bring an additional intensity to our 
Banking business.
We continue to make headway in Wealth as we grow our 
presence in Asia and modernize the digital experience for clients. 
In 2023, we added $56 billion in client balances and broadened 
our Citi Wealth at Work offering. However, Wealth revenues were 
down 5% from 2022, and we recognize there is more work to be 
done. With Andy Sieg having returned to Citi to run the Wealth 
business, we are well-positioned to capture the extraordinary 
wealth creation set to take place over the next decade. 
U.S. Personal Banking continued to show excellent momentum 
last year as revenues increased 14%, driven largely by a rebound in 
borrowing across Cards and solid spending in Branded Cards. We 
continued to innovate for clients with new products and offerings, 
including the launch of Citi Travel with Booking.com powered by 
Rocket Travel by Agoda. In Retail Banking, we launched Simplified 
Banking, which uses a tiered approach to unlock enhanced 
benefits, similar to an airline or hotel rewards program. And in 
Retail Services, we celebrated the 20-year milestone of our 
partnership with The Home Depot, in addition to launching a 
number of new products and other partner relationships. 
Operating with increased rigor and 
accountability
In September, we took our boldest step yet to fulfill Citi’s 
potential, announcing the most consequential series of 
changes to how we run the bank since the aftermath of the

Letter to shareholders
Dear shareholders,
We are on a mission to ensure that Citi delivers to its full potential for all stakeholders.
Over the past three years, we have successfully put the foundations in place for the bank we aspire to be. 
Last year represented a significant step forward in our journey as we reorganized the firm to sharpen the 
focus on our five businesses and simplify our operations and infrastructure. Between the reorganization 
of the firm and the strides made in divesting our international consumer franchises, our management 
structure and organizational model are now fully aligned to our strategy.
2
At the same time, we continued to instill a culture of excellence and accountability to ensure alignment 
with our shareholders’ interests. We also made progress on our Transformation and strengthening our risk 
and controls, although we recognize there’s more work to be done.

2008 financial crisis. Aligning our organizational structure with 
our strategy will help us build a simpler Citi, enabling us to be 
less bureaucratic and more focused on clients. 
The leaders of our five core businesses now sit at my leadership 
table, giving them greater influence on Citi’s strategy and 
execution, as well as greater accountability for realizing 
synergies and delivering results. We have eliminated the 
previous regional structures and lightened the management of 
our geographies. By moving to a more focused geographical and 
business management structure, we have significantly reduced 
certain internal financial management reports and eliminated 
more than 60 internal management committees so far. 
Without these structures and related processes and 
meetings, our teams can now spend more of their time 
focused on what is most important — serving clients. To that 
end, we created a Client organization, led by our first Chief 
Client Officer. This group is responsible for bringing the full 
power of our franchise to clients through a centralized view of 
our client strategy, segmentation and coverage model, as well 
as capital allocation. 
Our new structure is grounded in the vision and strategy we 
laid out at Investor Day, and these business and client changes 
support the 4-5% compound annual growth rate we set out 
to achieve over the medium-term. The changes allow us to 
provide far more transparency into the drivers of our business 
and focus on enhancing business performance. 
We have now closed the sales of nine of our 14 international 
consumer divestitures and made solid progress winding down 
consumer operations in China, Russia and South Korea. We 
restarted the sales process in Poland and are well down the 
execution path for the Mexico IPO in 2025. Having made 
progress divesting our consumer businesses outside the U.S., 
we now serve a much more targeted set of clients across our 
five interconnected businesses. 
Our number one priority
We know that to truly simplify Citi and unlock our firm’s full 
potential, we must continue investing in our Transformation. 
This is our multi-year effort to strengthen our risk and 
controls environment and data architecture, and it remains 
our number one priority. 
The Consent Orders issued in 2020 by two of our U.S. 
regulators — the Federal Reserve Board and Office of the 
Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) — underscored how we 
had underinvested in some of those areas for too long. The 
work to make up for that lost ground takes time, and we are 
determined to keep making upgrades and improvements. 
This year’s priorities include accelerating our work to strengthen 
our regulatory reporting and data remediation. Those efforts will 
build on the progress we have made this year. Our controls are 
more robust, exemplified by our new wholesale credit risk target 
operating model. By automating processes, they’re getting 
better and faster: booking or amending loans in North America 
now takes half the time it once did. 
6
In 2023, we also closed the FX consent order with the Federal 
Reserve Board and retired 6% of our legacy technology 
applications. Within the firm, our people are beginning to 
feel the benefits of the Transformation as we consolidate 
fragmented technology platforms, upgrade our data 
architecture and modernize our operating model for the 
digital age.
Our important role in the world
Our progress in the Transformation and executing our 
strategy is notable given the tremendous macroeconomic and 
geopolitical headwinds we contended with throughout the 
year. Ongoing volatility in the markets. Persistent inflation. 
Devastating conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. The 
disruptive potential of AI. The list goes on. 
Yet challenging environments such as these are precisely 
where Citi thrives. Our global network and mindset uniquely 
position us to support clients and communities around the 
world during difficult times. When three regional U.S. banks 
and one global bank failed in early 2023, for instance, our 
robust balance sheet allowed us to work with other large 
U.S. banks to stabilize the financial system. We continue to 
demonstrate that Citi is a source of strength for our clients and 
a source of stability for the financial system. 
For multinational companies, Citi offers the size and scale 
to help them compete around the world, without having to 
rely on a mix of local banks. We finance supply chains and 
partner with America’s top companies to bring products and 
services to American consumers at affordable prices. Around 
the world, we use our robust balance sheet to fund and 
facilitate transformational projects. In the U.S., we’ve been 
the number one affordable housing lender for 13 years in a 
row, which includes the financing of approximately 35,000 
affordable housing units in 2022.
In addition, we provide a variety of products that can help to 
increase financial inclusion, and we work with community 
development financial institutions (CDFIs) and minority-
owned depository institutions (MDIs) to reach underserved 
populations. As a proud participant of the OCC’s Project 
Reach, we are co-leading the workstream that is focused 
on strengthening MDIs. We are also engaged in initiatives to 
increase access to credit and reduce the number of Americans 
who are “credit invisible.” 
Heads down and focused on delivering
We are on a deliberate journey to unlock Citi’s full potential, 
and we have made some bold decisions over the last year to 
ensure we succeed. Our vision is clear. The strategy is set. The 
pieces are in place. A performance intensity is building.
I am excited about the work we have accomplished over the 
past year to simplify the firm and focus Citi’s power behind 
our five interconnected businesses. I am confident Citi is on 
the right path to meet our medium-term financial targets and 
deliver all the benefits of our firm to our stakeholders.
The road ahead will not always be linear, but our momentum 
and commitment will continue to carry us forward. We have 
the right people in place to get the job done, and we will not 
stop until we become the winning bank we know Citi can be. 
Sincerely,
Jane Fraser

DEAR FELLOW STAKEHOLDERS,
This year, NVIDIA made important advances in our growth markets 
and delivered strong financial results.
  Revenue excluding chipsets, which we are exiting,  
grew 33 percent. Growth was largely driven by discrete 
GPUs—including GeForce for gamers and consumers, 
Quadro for designers and Tesla for scientists and 
engineers. 
  PC users continue to value GPUs. More than half of all 
consumers and nearly all designers buy PCs with GPUs, 
reflecting the importance of graphics and our ability to 
continue providing amazing visual experiences.
  Tegra, our mobile processor, recorded revenue growth 
of more than 400 percent to $360 million. Our effort to 
engage the fast-growing mobile industry is paying off. 
We are one of the very few companies from the PC 
industry to have made the leap to the mobile industry.
  And we announced and shipped Tegra 3, the industry’s 
most advanced mobile processor, which has been 
adopted by top-tier phone and PC companies around  
the world.
The year wasn’t without challenges and disappointments. 
Disk drive shortages, caused by severe floods in Thailand, 
slowed the PC market. Demand in Europe was soft. And the 
first generation of Android tablets showed disappointing 
results, due to their high cost and limited applications. 
Rather than booting up PCs, we now turn to our always-
on, always-connected digital companions. With hundreds 
of thousands of applications just a touch away, these 
devices are more powerful than ever. 
Even amid the mobile computing revolution, the PC will 
remain the most productive and powerful computer. It 
will continue to be especially important for designers who 
create new worlds, engineers who design new products 
and gamers who crave more amazing experiences.
OUR STRATEGY
NVIDIA is dedicated to advancing visual computing, a 
growing field in which we have great expertise and passion. 
Our 4,500 patents granted or pending include inventions 
vital to modern computing, such as the GPU and program-
mable shading, as well as those that will shape the future 
of computing, such as CUDA and parallel processing.
Our GPUs give PCs the power to make visual applications 
silky smooth. We expect growth as more PCs are used for 
gaming, design and creating content.
We also extend the GPU into new growth opportunities, 
such as data centers that power cloud computing and 
mobile processors for smartphones and tablets.
This year, we made great progress executing our strategy.
Despite the challenging environment, revenue rose 13 
percent to $4.0 billion. Gross margin increased to 51.4 
percent, up 11.6 percentage points. Diluted earnings per 
share more than doubled to $0.94. 
TEGRA LIFTS OFF
Tegra grew strongly and has an exciting future. We have 
evolved from being a new entrant in a crowded field to one 
of the top partners for makers of smartphones and tablets. 
A SHIFTING LANDSCAPE
The computing world is experiencing its biggest transfor-
mation in decades. The PC’s position at its center is being 
replaced by the mobile device, helped by more energy-
efficient processors, wireless connectivity and data 
centers that have turned shrink-wrapped applications  
into web services delivered from the cloud. 
Tegra is setting the bar for the industry. With Tegra 2, we 
were the first to ship dual-core mobile processors. With 
Tegra 3, we were the first to ship quad-core processors, 
complete with a “4-PLUS-1” hybrid architecture that 
delivers exceptional processing power as well as great 
battery life. We also invented new technologies like PRISM, 
a power-saving backlight technology and DirectTouch, 
enabling faster touch processing.

--- Page 4 ---
Acer, ASUS, HTC, Fujitsu, LG and ZTE have already 
announced Tegra 3 super phones or tablets. Many  
more are in development.
We expanded in the mobile market in June with the  
$352 million cash acquisition of Icera, a U.K.-based 
modem company with a highly sophisticated processor 
that enables software-defined radios. With Icera, we are 
now one of a very few companies that offer leading-edge 
mobile processor, modem and system software. The  
ZTE Mimosa, introduced at the recent Mobile World 
Congress tradeshow, is only the first phone to bring 
together our Tegra and Icera technologies.
Cars, the ultimate mobile computer, are also an exciting 
growth opportunity for Tegra. Already, Tegra drives the 
infotainment systems for Audi and Lamborghini. Soon, it 
will be in systems from BMW, Tesla Motors and Rolls 
Royce. The car of the future will provide the comfort of a 
home theater and robotics technology to make driving 
safer. NVIDIA will play a key role in its development. 
GEFORCE: ESSENTIAL GEAR OF GAMERS 
The PC gaming market is thriving. Modern Warfare 3 
recorded over $1 billion in sales in just 16 days, one day 
faster than the blockbuster film Avatar. Battlefield 3 flew off 
the shelves and set new standards for realism and game-
play. In China, gamers keep 160,000+ icafes humming.
The purpose of GeForce is to amaze and delight gamers. 
We don’t stop at building the most advanced GPUs. We 
develop sophisticated graphics algorithms and software. 
We invent technologies that simulate physics, water, 
smoke, light and shadows to make games more realistic. 
We collaborate deeply with developers so that their games 
take full advantage of our GPUs. We invent 3D glasses that 
work perfectly with high-resolution computers, creating  
a more immersive experience. All of these innovations 
make possible the most amazing game experience.  
We are to gamers what Nike is to athletes.
Our dedication to their experience resulted in NVIDIA 
taking 64 percent of the desktop discrete market in the 
fourth quarter.  
We have just begun rolling out a new line of GeForce 
GPUs based on our revolutionary Kepler architecture, 
which brings unprecedented capabilities and a giant leap 
in energy efficiency. Initial reaction is fantastic. Reviews 
are glowing and gamers lined up all around the world for 
them, with the first shipments selling out in an hour. 
REVOLUTIONIZING WORKSTATIONS
Quadro helps designers realize their imagination and 
bring it quickly to market. 
This year, we introduced Maximus, putting a Tesla  
supercomputing GPU inside a workstation, resulting in  
a desk-side computer so powerful that it simulates the 
physics of a design while it is being created.
Designers and engineers can now simultaneously do 
graphics-intensive and compute-intensive work on the 
same machine. What once required racks of servers and 
hours of waiting can now be done on a desktop, in real 
time, greatly improving time to market. 
We joined forces with HP to introduce the world’s first 
all-in-one workstation, the Quadro-based HP Z1. The Z1 
features a 27-inch display that snaps open, like the hood 
of a car, so users can easily swap out parts and make 
upgrades; no tools required. This is an entirely new 
category of professional workstation that we believe  
will tap market segments, particularly in the creative 
professions, where space is at a premium and users are 
unwilling to compromise performance. 
TO EXASCALE AND BEYOND
Of the world’s Top500 supercomputers, 35 are now 
powered by NVIDIA GPUs—triple last year’s number. 
Supercomputers enable researchers to efficiently explore 
the most complex challenges in quantum chemistry, 
climate research, alternative energy and other critical 
scientific areas. Tesla GPUs gained strong momentum  
in high performance computing this past year, as the 
promise of exascale computing—about 1,000X faster than 
today’s supercomputers—took hold. 
Tesla GPUs power three of the world’s top five super-
computers. The National Center for Supercomputing 
Applications chose Tesla for its Blue Waters project, 
2

2012 ANNUAL REVIEW 

--- Page 5 ---
which will deploy a supercomputer capable of sustained 
performance of 1 petaflops. Oak Ridge National Labora-
tories selected Tesla as it set out to develop “Titan,” the 
world’s fastest supercomputer. 
Software developers from a broad range of industries see 
the benefits of Tesla. The number of Tesla-accelerated 
applications has grown to more than 80 from a handful 
two years ago, including those for molecular dynamics, 
computational chemistry and physics, seismic processing 
and equity risk analysis. 
Simulation has become the modern laboratory for a 
growing number of industries. High performance  
computing already consumes more than 2 million  
computing nodes a year. We believe all of these nodes  
will eventually utilize a GPU-CPU hybrid multi-core 
architecture. 
High performance computing is a large growth opportunity 
for GPUs. Supercomputing centers were early adopters, 
with industry and universities now coming on board.  
Data centers for consumer cloud services will come next. 
Today’s supercomputer is tomorrow’s cloud computing 
data center. 
INSPIRING OUR COMMUNITY
Our technologies are making a difference, and so are  
our people. 
With 7,300 employees across 40 offices worldwide,  
we are bound together by a common vision and values. 
NVIDIA’s high-performance, creative, one-team spirit 
starts from a culture of giving. Each year, we forego our 
holiday parties and dedicate our financial and human 
resources to help our communities in an effort called 
Project Inspire.
This year, some 1,500 employees, family and community 
members volunteered more than 10,000 hours to trans-
form Full Circle Farm, a community farm in Sunnyvale, 
Calif., dedicated to make a difference by helping and 
teaching the community to eat and live healthy. Through 
the effort of our employees, we expanded Full Circle’s 
facilities and growing capacity so they can become 
self-sustaining. 
And in response to Japan’s devastating earthquake and 
tsunami, we organized Operation Kizuna, which is the 
Japanese word for love and friendship. We donated  
$2.75 million, most of which was put toward helping  
small family businesses get back on their feet.
We gave back more this year than in any other. Our 
culture of giving is one of my greatest sources of pride. 
THE YEAR AHEAD
At the core of our strategy is creating amazing experiences 
by innovating in visual computing and advancing the GPU.
Already, the GPU is central to the computing experience 
for gamers and designers, and how we enjoy the rich 
displays of super phones and tablets. It is accelerating  
our way to exascale supercomputing. Soon, it will help 
cloud computing data centers deliver rich graphics.
Energy-efficiency is vital in each of these segments.  
It rests at the soul of Kepler—a GPU so energy efficient 
that it can power experiences from mobile devices to 
Ultrabooks to data centers.
Visual computing is more important than ever. Mobile 
computing is growing faster than ever. The market for  
the GPU is larger than ever. I believe the investments 
we’ve made will enable us to drive these trends and 
deliver rewards to our shareholders, our employees  
and our customers.

Letter  
To Shareholders
Michael L. Corbat 
Chief Executive Officer
Dear Fellow Shareholders:
2018 was a year of steady and meaningful 
progress for Citi toward the overarching goal we 
laid out at our Investor Day in 2017: to improve 
the returns we generate on shareholders’ 
capital through 2020 and beyond. On that 
day, we also outlined our strategy to meet 
that commitment. We would drive sustainable, 
client-led revenue growth by deepening our 
relationships with current clients and capturing 
new ones in target segments. We would use 
our scale and technology to enhance our 
capabilities while lowering our cost to serve 
clients. We would optimize our capital base, 
including returning all capital above what we 
need to prudently operate and invest in the 
firm. Finally, we would continue to focus on our 
controls and risk management to ensure Citi is 
an indisputably strong and stable institution.
2
In 2018, we did each of those things 
while demonstrating our ability to 
navigate a complex environment, which 
swung from a start marked by positive 
sentiment driven by U.S. tax reform and 
synchronized global growth to a close 
when markets declined with a volatility 
and velocity rarely seen. After a fourth 
quarter marked by concerns about the 
business cycle, trade with China and the 
impact of Federal Reserve interest rate 
policy, our continued progress in 2018 
provided welcome assurance that our 
people, model and global franchise are 
resilient in challenging markets.
Across our firm we drove growth, as 
we said we would do, by deepening 
relationships with current clients while 
also attracting new ones.
In our Global Consumer Bank, we used 
our scale and technology to make it 
easier for our clients to seamlessly 
bank with us, through their channel 
of choice. In our U.S. franchise, our 
enhanced mobile app now gives clients 
a comprehensive view of their finances 
and, in an industry first, gives non-
Citi clients those same capabilities. 
In Mexico, our redesigned mobile app 
is driving double-digit user growth. 
We are leveraging our experience 
in Asia, where we have high digital 
engagement and a growing digital 
lending platform.
In our Institutional Clients Group, we 
upgraded our capabilities to focus fully 
on providing clients with solutions, 
not products. Our Treasury and Trade 
Solutions business offers the industry’s 
most versatile and powerful suite of 
digital platforms, tools and analytics. 
A prime example is the launch of Citi 
Smart Match®, created in partnership 
with fintech firm HighRadius, which 
uses artificial intelligence and machine 
learning to enable our corporate 
clients to automate the matching of 
open invoices to payments.
But we’re not stopping there. Across 
Citi, we’re continuously innovating 
to enhance our value proposition 
and accelerate our speed to market. 
We’re streamlining client onboarding, 
providing more personalized offers, 
creating more intuitive and convenient 
self-service platforms, and taking 
pain points out of our processes. 
These actions lowered our cost to 
serve clients and enabled us to fund 
investments in areas that position us 
for future growth. In the second half 

--- Page 5 ---
of 2018, efficiency savings outpaced 
our incremental investments by about 
$200 million, an amount we expect 
to grow into the $500 million–$600 
million range in both 2019 and 2020.
We also made structural changes 
across the franchise to drive growth 
and boost returns. 
In our largest Consumer market — the 
U.S. — we created a more effective 
client-centric structure that unifies 
the leadership and strategy of our 
Branded Card and Retail Banking 
businesses, consistent with our 
consumer franchises in Asia and 
Mexico. Our franchise should not only 
attract new clients but also enable 
us to convert a larger proportion of 
our more than 28 million Branded 
Card clients into multi-relationship 
customers. As many of our current 
Card clients reside beyond our six-city 
retail branch footprint, we believe 
we can broaden these relationships 
by providing unique and compelling 
value propositions, combined with our 
industry-leading digital capabilities 
and nationwide ATM network.
In our Institutional Clients Group, 
we also made structural changes 
to further enhance our clients’ 
experience. By combining our 
Corporate, Investment Banking 
and Capital-Markets Origination 
divisions into a new unit, Banking, 
Capital Markets and Advisory, we’re 
providing clients with access to a 
broader range of creative solutions 
across our institutional platform. 
We’re also seeing the fruits of greater 
connectivity between our Treasury and 
Trade Solutions and foreign exchange 
businesses. Above all, we’re giving 
ourselves an opportunity to take a 
broader, deeper, more holistic view of 
our clients and their evolving needs.
All of those actions supported our 
strategy and contributed to our 
business performance in 2018. The 
$18 billion of net income we earned 
was 14% higher than in 2017, excluding 
the one-time impact of Tax Reform in 
both periods.1 On the same basis, our 
earnings per share increased 25% 
to $6.65 per share, driven by higher 
net income and the benefit of share 
repurchases. And we continued to 
make progress on our efficiency ratio, 
driving it down to approximately 57% 
for the year after lowering our expense 
base to just under $42 billion. 
Perhaps most significantly, our Return 
on Tangible Common Equity (ROTCE), 
increased to 10.9%2, surpassing our 
target of at least 10.5% for the year 
as we work toward our goal of at least 
13.5% for 2020.

Franz Humer and Anthony Santomero 
will also retire in 2019, having reached 
the retirement age for Citi Directors. 
Tony has been on the Board since 
2009 and chaired the Citibank Board 
and the Risk Management Committee. 
Franz has been on the Board since 2012 
and chaired the Ethics and Culture 
Committee. We thank both of them for 
their years of service. 
We also thank and congratulate several 
senior members of my management 
team on their retirement, including 
our Chief Financial Officer, John 
Gerspach, who is being succeeded by 
longtime Citi executive Mark Mason. 
Each of these talented executives 
will be missed, yet we’re excited to 
welcome a new group of executives 
into leadership positions at Citi, where 
I am sure they will shine.
In 2018, we also decided, on a number 
of occasions, that there are times when 
a company must take a stand. One of 
those times came in January, when 
in keeping with our commitment to 
diversity and inclusion, we were the first 
financial services firm to voluntarily 
disclose our adjusted pay gap between 
women and men in the U.S., the U.K. 
and Germany and between minorities 
and non-minorities in the U.S. We found 
that women were paid on average 99% 
of what men were paid and minorities 
were paid on average 99% of what non-
minorities were paid, and we made pay 
adjustments to help close the gaps. We 
viewed this as a first step on the road 
toward greater pay equity transparency. 
In February, I signed the CEO Action 
for Diversity & Inclusion, joining 
more than 350 CEOs and presidents 
committed to driving policy changes 
and practices in our own firms that 
advance equitable workplaces. Over 
the summer, my management team 
and I announced representation 
goals aimed at increasing the number 
of black colleagues in the U.S. and 
female colleagues globally in senior 
positions at our firm.

In the Institutional Clients Group, 
volatility and uncertainty at the 
end of the year adversely impacted 
our market-sensitive businesses, 
including Fixed Income and Investment 
Banking, although we grew share 
and revenues in M&A Advisory and 
Equities for the year. Our steady 
accrual businesses — Treasury and 
Trade Solutions, Securities Services, 
the Private Bank and Corporate 
Lending — grew revenues by 9% for 
the year. Our backbone Treasury and 
Trade Solutions business distinguished 
itself by growing revenues for the fifth 
consecutive year in constant dollars. 
And despite concerns about trade 
rhetoric and tariffs, our global network 
— one that is hard to see replicated in 
the current environment — showed it 
is well-positioned to capture flows no 
matter where they shift.
Our bankers also served clients with 
distinction, advising on some of the 
biggest deals of the year. A sampling 
includes NEX Group’s merger with  
CME Group, advising Time Warner on 
its acquisition by AT&T, serving as joint 
financial advisor to Ant Financial on 
the largest capital raise by a private 
company, and Nestlé Holdings on its 
first U.S. dollar private placement.
The trust, satisfaction and loyalty 
we’re building with Citi clients are 
also words that come to mind when 
I think about my Citi colleagues 
worldwide. They express how I feel 
about a number of close colleagues 
and friends of the firm who chose 
2018 either to retire or embark on an 
exciting new phase of their life. I won’t 
name them all, but I will note the 
important transition we announced 
in the fall, when, after nearly seven 
years as Chairman and a decade on 
our Board of Directors, Michael O’Neill 
retired. We are enormously grateful to 
Michael O’Neill for making Citi’s Board 
and our firm stronger, better, more 
diverse and more capable. 
The Board elected John C. Dugan as the 
next Chair. In doing so, we maintained 
our model of having a Non-Executive 
Chair, which is in keeping with leading 
corporate governance practices. John 
is a former Comptroller of the Currency, 
distinguished counselor and longtime 
industry leader. Having been a Board 
member since 2017 and an advisor to 
the Board before that, he knows our firm 
well and has hit the ground running.

At the end of the day, what matters most 
to me is that every Citi colleague feels 
pride in who they are and that Citi stands 
with them. In my experience, having a 
diverse team of people around the table 
with different thoughts, insights and 
perspectives leads to better decisions. 
In March, in the wake of the tragic 
school shooting in Parkland, Florida, 
and the epidemic of gun violence in 
the U.S., we were the first bank to 
announce a Commercial Firearms 
Policy. It requires our retail sector 
clients to use established best 
practices, including background checks 
and age restrictions. We’re under no 
illusion that any policy is a perfect 
solution, but we — and I — couldn’t feel 
more strongly that it’s up to companies 
like ours to do more when we can.
Throughout the year, our colleagues 
demonstrated their commitment to 
the communities we serve. In June, 
we brought more than 100,000 Citi 
volunteers, alumni, clients, friends 
and families in over 450 cities in 90 
countries and territories to work on 
more than 1,400 service projects in 
their communities. It was our largest 
Global Community Day ever. From 
feeding hungry people to revitalizing 
schools, our people showed the 
positive impact our company makes  
in the communities we serve.
The hard work of thousands of Citi 
colleagues has created a culture of 
which we can be proud. It’s a culture 
based on a foundation of ethics and 
execution, informed by our mission 
of enabling growth and economic 
progress around the world.
These efforts are among the reasons 
Euromoney named Citi “Best Bank 
for Corporate Social Responsibility.” 
I couldn’t have said it better myself 
than the editors did: “The focus on 
improving economies for everyone is 
something that runs deep at Citi.”
That focus is reflected in our 
Sustainable Progress initiative, under 
which we recorded $95 billion of 
transactions toward our 10-year,  
$100 billion environmental finance 
goal. It is a goal we are going to reach 
almost five years ahead of schedule. 
Citi Announced a Global, Mission-Led Partnership  
with the International Paralympic Committee
“Citi and the IPC are ideal partners because we share a deep 
passion for helping to foster a more diverse and inclusive  
society. These athletes have overcome adversity to achieve 
the world’s most elite level of sporting excellence. Their 
strength, perseverance and determination is truly what 
makes them exceptional, and we look forward to supporting 
their journey to compete on the global stage.”
— CEO Michael Corbat
The 18 National Paralympic  
Committees Citi will sponsor  
include Australia, Chinese Taipei, 
Colombia, Costa Rica, Great Britain, 
Hong Kong, India, Indonesia,  
Ireland, Malaysia, Mexico, Nigeria, 
Philippines, Poland, Singapore, 
South Africa, Thailand and the UAE. 
The international partnership will run through 
2020 and includes support for National Paralympic 
Committees in 18 countries as they prepare for 
upcoming World and regional Championships, 
as well as the Tokyo 2020 Paralympic Games. 
Through the partnership, Citi aims to raise 
awareness for the Paralympic Movement, support 
Para athletes, and advocate for societal change in 
perceptions around disability.
That focus also informed the Citi 
Foundation’s partnership with the 
International Rescue Committee to 
invest in training and placement for 
young refugees in Nigeria, Jordan  
and Greece. That partnership is  
part of our $100 million commitment 
through Pathways to Progress to  
help 500,000 young people globally 
to access economic opportunity 
through the workforce. 
We entered 2019 with determination 
and focus. We have articulated our 
goals and have the resources to meet 
them. While the macroeconomic picture 
requires flexibility, we are prepared for a 
range of operating environments. 
We will remain true to our mission of 
enabling growth and progress and will 
continue to be true to our values as we 
serve our clients. As we have shown 
in 2018, our targets are achievable 
and we are committed to continuing 
to make steady progress toward them 
every day throughout 2019.
Sincerely,
Michael L. Corbat

Letter to our Shareholders  
To our Shareholders
Letter to our Shareholders 
It is with deep concern that we are currently looking to Ukraine, 
to  the  people  there,  to  our  colleagues  and  our  European 
neighbors, who are suffering from the war. Since the start of the 
fighting, the Volkswagen Group and its brands have currently 
donated  a  total  of  more  than  5  million  euros  to  UNO-Flücht-
lingshilfe (the German partner of the UN Refugee Agency) and 
other aid organizations. At many of our sites, the workforce is 
supporting relief efforts, and many brands are providing cars 
for helpers in Eastern Europe. 
We cannot yet foresee the effects on the global economy. But it 
is already clear that a long war would harm not only Europe. 
The  international  community,  whose  prosperity  is  based  on 
free world trade and functioning supply chains, would be set 
back by decades. A return to diplomacy and conflict resolution 
based on international law are indispensable.  
The  success  of  the  Volkswagen  Group  with  its  120  sites 
worldwide  is  also  closely  intertwined  with  globalization.  In 
fiscal  year  2021,  the  Covid-19  pandemic  and  the  shortage  of 
semiconductors  repeatedly  led  to  production  stoppages  and 
supply bottlenecks throughout the entire automotive industry. 
As a result, we produced two million cars fewer than planned. 
The  fact  that  the  Group  was  nevertheless  able  to  double  its 
operating  profit  before  special  items  to  20  billion  euros 
compared to the previous year is due to our resilience and the 
strong  demand  for  our  vehicles,  both  in  the  conventional 
combustion  engine  business  and  increasingly  as  electric 
vehicles.  The  premium  group  with  its  brands  Audi,  Bentley, 
Lamborghini and Ducati contributed disproportionately more 
to the result. We are investing  the generated net cash flow of  
8.6  billion  euros  in  our  transformation  to  emission-free,  
autonomous mobility. We are proposing to our shareholders a 
dividend of 7.56 euros per preferred share and 7.50 euros per 
ordinary share for the 2021 fiscal year. 
The  success  of  Volkswagen  is  the  success  of  its  670,000 
employees around the globe. Also in 2021, they achieved a great 
deal.  The  semiconductor  task  force  found  solutions  to  short-
term  supply  bottlenecks  with  our  suppliers  and  the  semi-
conductor  manufacturers,  and  our  developers  brought  150 
technical alternatives into the cars to replace missing chips.   
We  also  achieved  a  great  deal  strategically  last  year.  Six  years 
ago,  we  made  the  decision  to  switch  our  portfolio  to  electric 
drives.  The  present  shows  that  this  was  the  right  decision.  In 
2021, we were market leader for electric vehicles in Europe with 
a market share of around 25% and were in second place in the 
USA with around 7.5%. This means that our market share for 
electric vehicles is already almost twice as high as for vehicles 
with  combustion engines. The American climate policy is giving 
us a tailwind: more than two thirds of all ID.4 buyers in the US 
are new to the Volkswagen brand. In China, we delivered 93,000 
electric  vehicles,  four  times  more  than  the  previous  year.  By 
2030, we will increase the global share of e-vehicles to 50%. The 
future of buses and trucks is also electric: TRATON will contin-
ually increase investments in the electrification. 
We have reached important milestones in our key markets: In 
the  US,  the  Volkswagen  brand  delivered  375,000  vehicles,  the 
best  result  since  2013.  After  years  of  losses,  the  Volkswagen 
brand  is  profitable  again  in  the  US,  as  well  as  in  Canada  and 
Mexico. We are hitting all the right buttons for the American 
market with our Atlas family of SUVs, the Taos, Tiguan and ID.4

– these five SUV models account for approximately 70% of US 
sales. In 2021, the Volkswagen brand also turned the corner in 
South  America.  With  locally  developed  models  such  as  the 
Nivus and Taos, we have modernized our product portfolio in 
recent years, and managed to increase our market shares and 
return  to  profit  and  positive  net  cash  flow.  In  China,  we 
continue  to  be  very  profitable.  The  Volkswagen  brand  is  the 
market leader with a share of almost 12%. Porsche, Bentley and 
Lamborghini have achieved their best delivery results ever.  
With our NEW AUTO strategy, we have set the course to make 
our  Group  fit  for  the  future.  We  are  transforming  ourselves 
from an automobile manufacturer with fascinating brands and 
excellent  engineering  to  a  vertically  integrated  mobility 
company.  Battery  and  charging  will  become  our  core  compe-
tence  and  source  of  revenue.  By  founding  our  own  company 
under European law, we are bundling our battery activities and 
occupying all the stages of the value chain that are critical to 
success.  In  future,  third  parties  will  also  be  able  to  become 
involved in the company – we are not ruling out an IPO. 
In the world of NEW AUTO, mobility will be emission-free and 
autonomous, with a high degree of customer orientation and 
new  sources  of  revenue,  for  example  through  assistance 
systems or a broad range of entertainment services that can be 
booked on demand. 
Software  is  the  basis  for  this  –  our  software  unit  CARIAD  is 
building  up  the  necessary  competencies  here.  CARIAD  now 
employs around 5,000 experts. Thanks to the close cooperation 
between CARIAD and our brands, around 56,000 customers of 
our ID. models were able to update their vehicles over the air 
last  year.  To  accelerate  progress  in  autonomous  driving,  we 
have integrated Hella’s camera software division and are con-
tinuing  to  expand  strategic  partnerships  –  for  example 
between  CARIAD  and  Bosch  for  the  joint  development  of 
software.  
tinuing  to  gather  experience  in  Hamburg  with  MOIA  after  a 
pandemic-related break, with the aim of having autonomous 
shuttles driving through the Hanseatic city from 2025. To this 
end, we are already testing autonomous driving in Munich with 
the Volkswagen ID. Buzz and Argo AI. 
As  for  our  headquarters  in  Wolfsburg,  we  have  developed  a 
vision  for  2030  to  ensure  the  competitiveness  of  our  largest 
location.  We  are  going  to  build  a  new  factory  for  two  billion 
euros  with  faster  and  more  efficient  processes  to  produce  
a  competitive,  electric  and  Level  4-capable  car  from  2026  
–  Project  Trinity.  It  will  bring  autonomous  driving  to  the 
volume segment. We are investing 800 million euros in a new 
development center, the most modern in Germany. In addition, 
a leaner, more efficient headquarters will be created at the site, 
which will manage the Group worldwide. 
Despite many successes, 2021 was not an easy year for many 
employees.  I  am  therefore  pleased  that  we  achieved  the  best 
score ever in the annual employee opinion survey; this score 
has been rising continuously since 2018. Thank you very much 
for your trust. And I would also like to thank you, dear Share-
holders, for supporting our strategy. 
We are already seeing the dramatic consequences of the war in 
Ukraine.  The  effects  on  our  company  cannot  be  foreseen  at 
present. However, in 2021, as in 2020, Volkswagen has shown 
that  our  business  is  resilient  despite  acute  global  challenges 
and that we are able to handle crises better than in the past. At 
the same time, we will continue to consistently implement our 
NEW AUTO strategy in order to play a leading role in the future 
world of mobility.  
Sincerely, 
We are gradually expanding our range of mobility services. We 
have initiated the acquisition of Europcar to add rental services 
to  our  range.  For  the  operation  of  shuttle  fleets,  we  are  con-

Letter From Your CEO
2011 Highlights
Letter From Your Chairman
Investor Information
2011 was an outstanding year for Intel. 
on a high-volume 14nm manufacturing facility in Arizona and 
Despite a tough macro-economic environment, 
a leading-edge development fabrication facility in Oregon.  
the company set records in platform unit sales, 
revenue, and earnings, reﬂ ecting strong global 
demand for our products and solid execution 
by our employees around the world. 
  We delivered revenue of $54.0 billion, up 24% compared to 
2010. Net income rose to $12.9 billion, up 13% from 2010, and 
earnings per share rose to $2.39, up 19% from the prior year. 
Spending as a percentage of revenue was approximately ﬂ at com-
pared to 2010, and our gross margin of 62.5% was at the top end 
of our historical gross margin range for the second year in a row. 
Continuing PC growth
In 2011, the global demand for PCs continued to surge, especially in 
emerging markets. For the ﬁ rst time, total PC purchases were higher 
in China than in any other country, followed by the U.S., Brazil, and 
Russia. Intel has beneﬁ ted from this growth, and as a result, 2011 
revenue for the PC market segment of our business increased 17% 
compared to 2010.  
  Meanwhile, the PC itself is undergoing a renaissance. Last year, 
Intel led the industry in reinventing the PC experience with the 
launch of Ultrabook™ systems, a new category of thin, responsive, 
and secure mobile devices that combine the best features of tablets 
and notebooks. The ﬁ rst Ultrabook systems, powered by 2nd 
generation Intel® Core™ processors, were introduced in 2011, and 
we expect that the industry will bring more than 80 new Ultrabook 
system designs to market in 2012. 
Data storage and high-performance computing 
Our Data Center Group develops technology for a range of applica-
tions—from cloud computing and mission-critical servers to high-
performance computing (HPC). Revenue for our Data Center Group 
topped $10.1 billion in 2011, up 17% from 2010.
  We produced our ﬁ rst teraﬂ op processor, capable of performing 
complex HPC tasks such as mapping the human genome. In addition, 
more high-volume storage and networking industries are standard-
izing on Intel® architecture, with Intel® Xeon® processors replacing 
proprietary solutions in routers, switches, and other parts of the 
communications infrastructure. 
Technology leadership
Intel continues to develop the world’s most advanced semiconductor 
Software and services
As the world’s digital footprint expands, so does its vulnerability 
to security breaches. More unique pieces of malware were 
identiﬁ ed in the last two years than existed worldwide prior to 
2010. In 2011, mobile malware increased 70% over 2010. Intel 
recognized this growing threat and the need for a new approach 
to platform security, which led to our acquisition of McAfee in 2011. 
The McAfee DeepSAFE* technology platform, introduced in 2011, 
combines McAfee’s security software with Intel’s silicon capabilities 
and is designed to detect and prevent day-zero attacks. 
Looking ahead
Our industry is at the brink of a major transformation. The number 
of connected devices in the world now tops 4 billion and continues 
to rise rapidly. Transistor usage over the past three decades will 
look ﬂ at compared to what will be needed to manage, interpret, and 
store data over the next ﬁ ve years. This creates a huge opportunity 
for Intel—and we are ready to deliver. 
For example, we now have the power envelope, volume 
economics, and technology to succeed in the smartphone market 
segment with our new Intel® Atom™ processor platform. This 
platform powers the Intel smartphone reference design that we 
introduced in early 2012. Our industry partners have responded 
enthusiastically. We have a multi-year strategic partnership with 
Motorola Mobility covering both smartphones and tablets, and a 
joint effort with Google to optimize future releases of the Android* 
platform for low-power Intel Atom processors.  
Corporate responsibility leadership
In 2011, we extended our reputation as a leading corporate citizen, 
making progress on our strategic objective to care for our people, 
care for our planet, and inspire the next generation. Last year, we 
became the ﬁ rst semiconductor company to obtain LEED* Silver 
Certiﬁ cation for an entire manufacturing campus. We helped create 
economic and social opportunities in over 100 countries through 
our education transformation efforts, and reached our goal of 
providing technology training to 10 million teachers. Intel was once 
again named one of Fortune’s Best Companies to Work For, and we 
continued to empower our people to give back to their communities 
worldwide, with 50% of our workforce donating more than 1.1

2011 Highlights
Letter From Your Chairman
Investor Information
2011 was an outstanding year for Intel. 
on a high-volume 14nm manufacturing facility in Arizona and 
Despite a tough macro-economic environment, 
a leading-edge development fabrication facility in Oregon.  
the company set records in platform unit sales, 
revenue, and earnings, reﬂ ecting strong global 
demand for our products and solid execution 
by our employees around the world. 
  We delivered revenue of $54.0 billion, up 24% compared to 
2010. Net income rose to $12.9 billion, up 13% from 2010, and 
earnings per share rose to $2.39, up 19% from the prior year. 
Spending as a percentage of revenue was approximately ﬂ at com-
pared to 2010, and our gross margin of 62.5% was at the top end 
of our historical gross margin range for the second year in a row. 
Continuing PC growth
In 2011, the global demand for PCs continued to surge, especially in 
emerging markets. For the ﬁ rst time, total PC purchases were higher 
in China than in any other country, followed by the U.S., Brazil, and 
Russia. Intel has beneﬁ ted from this growth, and as a result, 2011 
revenue for the PC market segment of our business increased 17% 
compared to 2010.  
  Meanwhile, the PC itself is undergoing a renaissance. Last year, 
Intel led the industry in reinventing the PC experience with the 
launch of Ultrabook™ systems, a new category of thin, responsive, 
and secure mobile devices that combine the best features of tablets 
and notebooks. The ﬁ rst Ultrabook systems, powered by 2nd 
generation Intel® Core™ processors, were introduced in 2011, and 
we expect that the industry will bring more than 80 new Ultrabook 
system designs to market in 2012. 
Data storage and high-performance computing 
Our Data Center Group develops technology for a range of applica-
tions—from cloud computing and mission-critical servers to high-
performance computing (HPC). Revenue for our Data Center Group 
topped $10.1 billion in 2011, up 17% from 2010.
  We produced our ﬁ rst teraﬂ op processor, capable of performing 
complex HPC tasks such as mapping the human genome. In addition, 
more high-volume storage and networking industries are standard-
izing on Intel® architecture, with Intel® Xeon® processors replacing 
proprietary solutions in routers, switches, and other parts of the 
communications infrastructure. 
Technology leadership
Intel continues to develop the world’s most advanced semiconductor 
Software and services
As the world’s digital footprint expands, so does its vulnerability 
to security breaches. More unique pieces of malware were 
identiﬁ ed in the last two years than existed worldwide prior to 
2010. In 2011, mobile malware increased 70% over 2010. Intel 
recognized this growing threat and the need for a new approach 
to platform security, which led to our acquisition of McAfee in 2011. 
The McAfee DeepSAFE* technology platform, introduced in 2011, 
combines McAfee’s security software with Intel’s silicon capabilities 
and is designed to detect and prevent day-zero attacks. 
Looking ahead
Our industry is at the brink of a major transformation. The number 
of connected devices in the world now tops 4 billion and continues 
to rise rapidly. Transistor usage over the past three decades will 
look ﬂ at compared to what will be needed to manage, interpret, and 
store data over the next ﬁ ve years. This creates a huge opportunity 
for Intel—and we are ready to deliver. 
For example, we now have the power envelope, volume

DEAR SHAREHOLDERS,
The year 2022 was a challenging, but nonetheless successful one for the BMW Group. 
The ongoing war in Ukraine is a human tragedy that moves us all deeply. In economic 
terms, too, the conflict has had a massive impact, with severe repercussions for vital supply 
chains. The general situation was also exacerbated by repeated lockdowns in China and 
numerous bottlenecks affecting semiconductor availability. However, despite these adverse 
geo political and macroeconomic circumstances, the BMW Group performed well in 2022 
within the competitive environment. With around 2.4 million vehicles sold and the production 
of all-electric vehicles making good progress, the BMW Group has clearly demonstrated 
that a strong product portfolio is the best response to a challenging environment. 
We got off to a flying start in 2023 with the unveiling of the BMW i Vision Dee at the Con-
sumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. “Dee” stands for Digital Emotional Experience, a 
new form of interaction between people and their cars in which genuine driving pleasure 
and the virtual world merge seamlessly. With this vehicle, BMW has already arrived in the 
future in terms of digitalisation!
For 2023, we intend to maintain our firm course of profitable growth and press ahead with 
the ramping up of electric mobility. We are convinced that the future of the BMW Group is 
electric, digital and circular – and it has already begun! 
Norbert Reithofer
Chairman of the Supervisory Board

Report of the Supervisory Board
Focus of Supervisory Board activities during the past financial year
The Supervisory Board performed the duties incumbent upon it with the utmost diligence 
throughout the financial year 2022. 
and risk management measures on a regular basis. The latest developments in the semi-
conductor supply situation were also  discussed at each meeting. 
Based on in-depth reports presented by the Board of Management, in our capacity as a 
supervisory body we assiduously monitored the governance of the BMW Group and advised 
the Board of Management on matters relating to the management and strategic develop-
ment of the Group. We focused in particular on the progressive electrification of the Group’s 
product portfolio and on implementing the corporate strategies adopted in the fields of 
digitalisation and sustainability. At each of the five plenary sessions of the Supervisory 
Board (including two two-day meetings), we held detailed discussions with the Board 
of Management regarding the Group’s situation, addressing a variety of topics, including 
the risks associated with the ongoing global uncertainty and risk management. The 
Board of Management also kept the Supervisory Board well informed of any matters of 
significance outside the framework of formal meetings. I also discussed key current 
 matters personally with the Chairman of the Board of Management between meetings on 
a regular basis. In addition to scheduled meetings, the Chairman of the Audit Committee 
was also in direct contact with the Board of Management member responsible for Finance 
as well as with the external  auditor’s representatives. Furthermore, we regularly dealt 
with personnel-related matters as well as internal Supervisory Board issues without the 
presence of the Board of Management. 
Within the Supervisory Board and its committees, dialogues were always conducted in an 
open and constructive spirit, both internally and together with members of the Board of 
Management. Detailed documents distributed in a timely manner prior to meetings enabled 
members to prepare appropriately for the topics up for discussion. In addition, separate 
preliminary meetings of the shareholder and employee representatives were held on a 
regular basis prior to Supervisory Board meetings.
In its reports on the BMW Group’s position, the Board of Management kept us well 
 informed at each meeting regarding current developments and the Group’s overall perfor-
mance. A regular topic of discussion was the development of current sales trends based 
on figures analysed by brand, segment and market region for both the BMW Group and its 
competitors, with a keen focus on electrified vehicles. An overview of key financial indica-
tors and the liquidity situation of the BMW Group was also an integral part of these reports. 
In view of the far-reaching consequences of the war in Ukraine, including the impact on 
business in Russia and the recurrent coronavirus -related lockdowns in China, we were pro-
vided with up-to-date information on current  developments, risks to business performance 
The monitoring of corporate strategy also remained high on the Supervisory Board’s 
agenda. The Board of Management provided an in-depth account of its strategies, focus-
ing on the automotive sector’s transformation in the fields of electrification, digitalisation 
and the circular economy and emphasising the importance of the NEUE KLASSE as a huge 
leap in terms of product features. The latest purchasing strategies in place were also 
 explained to us in great depth. Growing challenges in relation to supply chain management 
and the ongoing trend towards technology clusters were both discussed at considerable 
length. Particular attention was paid to the Catena-X platform, a cross-company network 
designed to improve supply security and carbon emissions management throughout 
the supply chain using standardised data exchange systems. The overall market situation 
as well as the outlook for automated driving were also subjects of the Board of Manage-
ment’s reports. In conjunction with the information provided on the topic of sustainability, 
the Board of Management reaffirmed the BMW Group’s ambitious decarbonisation targets 
for the year 2030. 
At each meeting, the Board of Management updated us on the current status of its strategy- 
and project-related work as well as the progress being made in implementing its declared 
strategy of environmental sustainability. These updates also included current events such 
as the opening of the Lydia plant in China, which is fully geared to e-mobility production, 
the start of production of fuel cell systems at the BMW Group’s in-house competence centre 
for hydrogen in Munich, the market launch of the all-electric BMW iX1 as well as the found-
ing of the “Circular Republic” initiative in collaboration with UnternehmerTUM GmbH on all 
aspects of the circular economy.
Moreover, the Board of Management reported to us on other current topics, such as the 
highly successful presentation of the new BMW 7 Series in Palm Springs, USA, the activi-
ties surrounding the 100th anniversary of the BMW plant and the 50th anniversary of 
the BMW Group’s “Vierzylinder” tower in Munich, the unveiling of the Spectre, the first 
all-electric Rolls-Royce, and the eight IQS Quality Awards received for five of our vehicle 
models as well as three of the BMW Group’s plants.
On several occasions we deliberated on major changes affecting the legal framework 
and/or regulatory projects that are of significance to the BMW Group, in particular the 
EU’s regulations regarding fleet carbon emissions in conjunction with the EU’s “Fit for 55” 
package and the Euro 7 emissions standards.

Report of the Supervisory Board
Furthermore, the Supervisory Board closely monitored developments relating to major 
strategic cooperations. In 2022, the focus was particularly on the Chinese market, with 
 respect to both the BMW Brilliance Automotive joint venture, in which the BMW Group was 
able to increase its share to 75 % with effect from 11 February 2022, and the cooperation 
with Great Wall Motors for the local production of an all-electric MINI. The Board of Manage-
ment updated us on the current status of these projects at each meeting. In light of the 
sale of SHARE NOW, we were also kept informed of strategic developments at YOUR NOW 
as well as the strengthening of the BMW Group’s luxury segment product range through 
the acquisition of the ALPINA brand.
The development of the BMW Group’s equity and considerations undertaken by the 
Board of Management regarding the possible implementation of a share buyback pro-
gramme were further key items on our agenda. Based on the rationale provided by the 
Board of Management, we approved the resolution proposed to the Annual General Meeting 
to authorise the acquisition of treasury shares. At the same time, the Supervisory Board 
stipulated a requirement to obtain the Supervisory Board’s approval in certain cases of 
share buybacks and assigned responsibility for deciding on such approval to the Audit 
Committee. 
The Supervisory Board reviewed the targeted, maximum and expected level of Board of 
Management remuneration for the financial year 2022 in light of the BMW Group’s busi-
ness performance as well as the multi-year remuneration trend of its senior executives and 
employees within Germany. Based on a comparative study conducted by an external inde-
pendent remuneration consultant and subsequent oral advice, we concluded that both the 
remuneration paid to Board of Management members for the financial year 2021 and the 
target remuneration for 2022 are appropriate. In December 2022, following thorough prepa-
ration by the Personnel Committee, we adopted the variable remuneration targets appli-
cable to Board of Management members for the financial year 2023, taking into account the 
budget for 2023, the long-term business plan and the Group’s corporate strategy. Detailed 
information on Board of Management remuneration for the financial year 2022 is provided 
in the Remuneration Report. 
In addition, we deliberated upon key issues arising within the Board of Management’s 
various key areas of responsibility in the course of our work. We carefully considered 
the planned realignment of the BMW Group’s retail operations in specified regions to an 
agency model based on a presentation explaining the objectives, implementation steps 
and plans for individual European markets. The European market as a whole was also the 
subject of an in-depth sales report. 
The fundamental structures of the BMW Group’s risk management system as well as the 
key elements of its risk strategy were clearly set out for us in the detailed Risk Report. In 
 addition, various scenarios and risk mitigation measures were discussed regarding a range 
of topics of current relevance for the key areas Development, Purchasing, Production and 
Sales. The Board of Management also reported to us on the strategy, performance, sector- 
specific risk profile and current projects of the Financial Services line of business. Key 
topics relating to the Group’s financing system were also discussed at length.
During the year under report, we reviewed the strategies pursued by Human Resources, 
including maintaining the attractiveness of the BMW Group as an employer. The Board of 
Management also brought us up to date on the current status of the diversity concepts 
 developed by the Group and the extent to which targets have been achieved regarding the 
proportion of women employed at various levels. 
We also gave thorough consideration to the current status, maturity and evolution of the 
Group’s compliance management system. In his annual report, the Chief Compliance 
 Officer presented the key stages of development that have been defined for this system 
and provided an insight into a number of individual projects, including in particular the 
 implementation of the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act. 
In December 2021, the Supervisory Board agreed to the initial plan to hold the 2022 Annual 
General Meeting on a virtual basis in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic and in March 
2022, the detailed concept proposed by the Board of Management was approved. In Decem-
ber 2022, the Supervisory Board also agreed to hold the 2023 Annual General Meeting 
on a virtual basis, particularly in view of the higher level of planning certainty and the lower 
consumption of resources. In this context, it will be ensured that shareholders can exercise 
their rights on an equivalent basis to an AGM held in person.
I personally hold discussions with investor representatives on topics specific to the Super-
visory Board on a regular basis. Key topics discussed during the past financial year included 
corporate-governance-relevant issues such as targets for the composition of the Super-
visory Board, the Remuneration Report and arrangements for the Annual General Meeting. 
Another topic of these discussions was the  Supervisory Board’s dealing with the corpo-
rate strategy, in particular with regard to sustainability targets set by the BMW Group.

The BMW Group’s long-term business plan was subjected to comprehensive examination. 
Focusing on the transformation towards sustainable mobility, the Board of Management 
presented its forecasts for the various segments as well as ambitious long-term targets set 
for the Group. The key targets of profitable growth across all segments and sales growth 
of all-electric models were both reaffirmed. The Board of Management also reported on 
financial planning as well as opportunity and risk scenarios pertaining to the Automotive 
segment. Following thorough examination, the Supervisory Board approved the long-term 
business plan drawn up by the Board of Management. 
In December, the Board of Management presented the budget for the financial year 2023. 
After detailed discussion with the Board of Management, including the particular challenges 
in view of the uncertain and volatile overall situation, we gave our approval to this docu-
ment as well.
Based on the new version of the German Corporate Governance Code, we have continued 
to develop the BMW Group’s system of corporate governance, including a revision of 
the competence profile stipulated for the Supervisory Board as one particular contribution. 
A qualification matrix showing each individual Supervisory Board member’s areas of 
 expertise is provided in the Statement of Corporate Governance on the BMW Group web-
site. Based on a self-assessment, we concluded that the composition of the Supervisory 
Board at 31 December 2022 fully meets the targets stipulated in the diversity concept and 
the competency profile.
In light of the major significance attached to sustainability-related topics, the tasks assigned 
to the Audit Committee and the Presiding Board in this respect have now been delineated 
more clearly in our Rules of Procedure.
In the Declaration of Compliance with the German Corporate Governance Code issued in 
December 2022, the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board confirmed that they 
have complied with the recommendations of the Code as amended on 16 December 2019 
without exception. Moreover, we have fully complied with the recommendations contained 
in the latest version of the Code dated 28 April 2022 and intend to continue doing so going 
forward. 
With BMW AG’s support, Supervisory Board members received further training on various 
topics during 2022. In March, for instance, in training sessions with representatives of the 
auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft (PwC), we took 
an in-depth look at current and future frameworks applicable for non-financial reporting 
and familiarised ourselves with EU Taxonomy regulations. At our two-day meeting held in 
July, our agenda also gave us the opportunity to gain an insight into digital, AI-supported 
factory planning (“BMW iFACTORY”) at the Dingolfing plant, the BMW Group’s largest pro-
duction location in Europe. In this context, we were informed about the key aspects of the 
“Lean, Green, Digital” concept for sustainable, digital production systems. 
In September, motivated in part by a keynote speech made by an external speaker on 
the future of e-mobility from the perspective of an energy company and grid operator, we 
looked at the challenges arising relating to the availability of energy supplies on the one 
hand and the expansion of charging infrastructure in Germany on the other. Furthermore, 
the Supervisory Board members had the opportunity to test-drive various vehicles with 
 different drive systems at the BMW and MINI Driving Academy in Maisach near Munich. In 
addition, we were given a preview of the architecture, design, display and operating con-
cept of the NEUE KLASSE, including a whole host of innovative features. Last but not least, 
in December we discussed the perception of the BMW Group on the capital market with 
an external capital market expert familiar with the automotive sector.
The onboarding programme for new Supervisory Board members was continued in 2022, 
with representatives of the Group’s specialist departments taking the time to provide useful 
insights into the key business areas as well as the planning processes deployed at the 
BMW Group. New members were also introduced to the ongoing work of the Supervisory 
Board. 
Towards the end of 2022, we reviewed the effectiveness of the work of the Supervisory 
Board and its committees with the aid of a questionnaire, the results of which were dis-
cussed at the meeting. Cooperation, within the Supervisory Board itself and with the Board 
of Management, was unanimously assessed as being constructive and fruitful. We are 
 already planning to follow up on a number of suggestions in 2023 with a view to increasing 
our understanding of specific topics, in particular individual aspects of the BMW Group’s 
sustainability strategy, such as hydrogen technology and sustainable energy generation at 
a BMW site.

Report of the Supervisory Board
The Supervisory Board is careful to avoid any conflicts of interest in the course of its delib-
erations and decision-making processes. No conflicts of interest were either reported or 
identified during the financial year 2022. 
Description of Presiding Board activities and committee work 
The Supervisory Board has established a Presiding Board and four committees. The 
Chairman of the Audit Committee, Dr Bock, and myself reported in detail on the work of the 
 Presiding Committee as well as the committees at each of the subsequent Supervisory 
Board meetings. Further information on the duties, composition and working methods of 
the Presiding Board as well as the committees is provided in the Statement of Corporate 
Governance on our website.
Unless a particular committee was responsible, the Presiding Board prepared the content 
of the topics for the plenary meetings at its four meetings in cooperation with the Board 
of Management and senior heads of department and made suggestions for topics to be 
reported on at Supervisory Board meetings. 
The Audit Committee convened eight times in total. 
In February and March 2022, the focus was on preparing the Supervisory Board meeting 
at which the financial statements for the financial year 2021 were discussed and examined. 
After considering the matter of independence, the Audit Committee recommended to the 
Supervisory Board that PwC be proposed for election as auditor at the 2022 Annual General 
Meeting. There were no indications of conflicts of interest, grounds for exclusion or lack of 
 independence on the part of the auditor. 
The Audit Committee concluded that PwC’s fee proposal for the audit of the Company and 
Group Financial Statements and the BMW Group Report 2022 as well as for the review of 
the Half-Year Report 2022 was appropriate in light of the scope of its tasks and issued the 
corresponding contracts to PwC following their election at the Annual General Meeting in 
May 2022. The Audit Committee also specified supplementary audit focus areas. Moreover, 
it approved the scope of the non-audit services to be performed by PwC, the progress of 
which was reported to us on a regular basis. At its meetings, the Audit Committee discussed 
the quality of the audit in depth on several occasions. In particular, it requested the relevant 
department to report on the Group’s perception of the audits of the financial statements for 
the financial year 2021 as well as on the results of the survey conducted within the Group in 
this context. Based on this report, the auditor’s description of the quality assurance meas-
ures undertaken and the Audit Committee’s own experience with the auditor, the audit was 
found to be of good quality. 
We also examined the combined Non-financial Statement of BMW AG and the BMW Group 
for the financial year 2021, which is part of the BMW Group Report. Here, too, the represent-
atives of PwC reported to us on the findings of their audit. We have again engaged PwC to 
conduct a “limited assurance” audit of the Non-financial (Group) Statement for the finan-
cial year 2022, to the extent that it relates to parts of the management report that are not 
subject to a “reasonable assurance” audit. Going beyond the formal review required by 
law, the Audit Committee also engaged PwC to audit the contents of the Remuneration 
Report for the financial year 2022.
The Quarterly Statements were presented by the Board of Management and discussed 
with the Audit Committee prior to their publication. Representatives of the external auditors 
were present when the Half-Year Financial Report was discussed at the beginning of 
 August 2022. 
Furthermore, the Audit Committee considered the development of the BMW Group’s equity 
and the share buyback programme 2022/2023 proposed by the Board of Management. 
Based on the responsibility vested in it by the Supervisory Board, the Audit Committee gave 
its approval to the programme in June.
The Audit Committee considered the effectiveness and appropriateness of the BMW Group’s 
internal control system (including the Corporate Audit function and the compliance man-
agement system) as well as of the risk management system, focusing in particular on the 
current risk situation and the assessment of risk scenarios. We regularly monitor develop-
ments in the internal control system for non-financial reporting, with regard to the Group’s 
sustainability-related targets. We also had Corporate Audit reports on the key findings 
of internal audits and the status of both ongoing and planned audits explained to us. The 
Chief Compliance Officer of the BMW Group reported on changes in the BMW Group’s 
compliance management system in terms of strategic focus as well as on the implementa-
tion of operational measures and further planning. We also received a report on the status 
of the Tax and Customs Control System from the relevant head of department. The in-house 
General Counsel provided us with detailed information regarding major legal disputes and 
proceedings. We also requested information on important product quality issues.

Report of the Supervisory Board
In its report on the audit of over-the-counter derivatives entered into by BMW AG during the 
financial year 2021, the external auditor confirmed to the Audit Committee the effectiveness 
of the system in place at BMW AG in complying with the regulatory requirements of the 
 European Market Infrastructure Regulation. 
The Audit Committee concurred with the decision of the Board of Management to raise 
the Company’s share capital in accordance with Article 4 (5) of the Articles of Incorporation 
(Authorised Capital 2019) by € 1,439,975 and issue a corresponding number of new non- 
voting bearer shares of preferred stock in conjunction with the Employee Share Programme.
Within its role as a preparatory body, in its four meetings the Personnel Committee focused 
on the remuneration of, and succession planning for, the Board of Management. The ap-
propriateness of Board of Management remuneration for the financial years 2021 and 2022 
was reviewed, including rigorous scrutiny of the determination of the corporate earnings 
and performance factors applicable for Board of Management remuneration during those 
two years. In addition, the Personnel Committee deliberated on targets for the financial 
year 2023. Apart from these matters, it prepared one reappointment and one new appoint-
ment. The committee also adopted a resolution to approve loans granted by and trans-
actions concluded by BMW Bank with members of the representative bodies of BMW AG, 
and prepared for a change in the BMW Group’s external remuneration consultant.
The Nomination Committee convened once during the financial year 2022. Taking into ac-
count the German Corporate Governance Code and the composition requirements resolved 
by the Supervisory Board, the Nomination Committee discussed the composition of the 
Supervisory Board regarding shareholder representatives and issued a recommendation 
regarding the Supervisory Board’s election proposal to the 2023 Annual General Meeting. 
The Mediation Committee, which is prescribed by law, did not need to convene during the 
financial year 2022.
Composition of the Board of Management 
The composition of the Board of Management did not change during the financial year 2022. 
However, the Supervisory Board resolved to extend the term of office of one member.
Composition of the Supervisory Board, the Presiding Board and the Supervisory 
Board’s committees 
There were no changes to the composition of the Supervisory Board during the financial 
year 2022 on the shareholder representative side. The Annual General Meeting elected 
Dr Heinrich Hiesinger to the Supervisory Board for a further term of office of approximately 
four years.
With regard to the employee representatives, Mr Werner Zierer retired from the Supervisory 
Board with effect from 31 March 2022 as well as Dr Thomas Wittig (as representative of 
the executive employees) with effect from 31 May 2022, in each case due to retirement. We 
wish to thank both gentlemen for their outstanding cooperation. We would also like to 
thank Mr Zierer for his dedicated work over a period of more than 20 years, and Dr Wittig 
for his knowledgeable support as an expert in the field of finance. André Mandl, Chairman 
of the Works Council of the Regensburg plant, was appointed as successor to Mr Zierer and 
Mr Gerhard Kurz, Head of Purchasing, Quality Management Drive at BMW AG, was ap-
pointed as successor for Dr Wittig, each for the remaining term of office and by court order. 
In addition, at the end of 2022, the long-serving First Deputy Chairman of our Supervisory 
Board and Chairman of the General Works Council of BMW AG, Mr Manfred Schoch, 
stepped down from the Supervisory Board to enjoy his well-earned retirement. Mr Schoch 
had been a member of the Supervisory Board since 1988 and, over this long period of 
time, had a decisive influence on the work of the Supervisory Board thanks to his entrepre-
neurial far-sightedness, professional competence and overall commitment to championing 
the best interests of the BMW Group and its employees. We wish to give Manfred Schoch a 
special vote of thanks for his life’s work.
In September 2022, the Audit Committee was enlarged following the election of Rachel 
Empey and Dr Dominique Mohabeer, thereby improving the Committee’s level of financial 
expertise and diversity as well as the Committee’s independence. An overview of the 
 composition of the Super visory Board and its committees is provided in the Statement of 
Corporate Governance which is available on our website together with the curricula vitae 
of Supervisory Board members.

Examination of financial statements and the profit distribution proposal
PwC was appointed as external auditor for the financial year 2022. PwC initially conducted 
a review of the condensed Interim Group Financial Statements and the Interim Group Man-
agement Report for the first half of 2022 and presented its findings to the Audit Committee. 
No issues were identified that might indicate that the condensed Interim Group Financial 
Statements and Interim Group Management Report had not been prepared in accordance 
with the applicable provisions in all material respects.
The Company Financial Statements and the Group Financial Statements of BMW AG for 
the financial year 2022, including the Combined Management Report, on which PwC has 
issued unqualified audit opinions, were authorised by the Board of Management on 
7 March 2023. These audit opinions were signed for the fourth consecutive financial year 
by Petra Justenhoven as independent auditor (Wirtschaftsprüferin) and, for the first time, 
by Michael Popp (Wirtschaftsprüfer) as the auditor responsible for the performance of the 
engagement. 
At its meeting held on 1 March 2023, the Audit Committee initially gave in-depth considera-
tion to the preliminary version of the Company and Group Financial Statements and the 
Combined Management Report (including the combined Non-financial (Group) Statement 
and the information on EU Taxonomy) as well as the draft version of the auditor’s long-
form reports. 
Immediately after authorising their issue, the Board of Management submitted the Company 
and Group Financial Statements for the financial year 2022 and the Combined Manage-
ment Report (including the Combined Non-financial (Group) Statement) to the Supervisory 
Board. The auditor’s long-form audit reports were also submitted to the Supervisory 
Board in a prompt manner. In order to facilitate preparations, drafts of these documents 
had already been made available to the Supervisory Board in advance.
At its meeting held on 8 March 2023, the Audit Committee diligently examined and deliber-
ated on these documents before they were considered in detail at the plenary session of 
the Supervisory Board on 9 March 2023. 
At the two respective meetings, the Board of Management provided a detailed explanation 
of the reporting documents to the Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board. The repre-
sentatives of the external auditor reported on the main findings of their audit and answered 
questions put to them by members of the Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board,

Report of the Supervisory Board
 partially without the members of the Board of Management being present. Both the 
 Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board gave meticulous consideration to the key 
audit  matters and the related audit procedures. 
The representatives of the external auditors confirmed that the risk management system 
established by the Board of Management is capable of identifying any developments that 
might threaten the Company’s going-concern status at an early stage. They also confirmed 
that no material weaknesses in the internal control system and risk management system 
were identified with regard to the financial reporting process. In the course of their audit 
work, they did not identify any facts inconsistent with the contents of the Declaration of 
Compliance pursuant to § 161 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) jointly issued by 
the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board.
Based on a thorough examination conducted by the Audit Committee and the Supervisory 
Board, we concurred with the results of the external audit. In accordance with the final 
 result of this examination, no objections were raised. At our meeting held on 9 March 2023, 
we accordingly approved the Group and Company Financial Statements of BMW AG for 
the financial year 2022. The Company Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 
2022 have therefore been adopted.
Furthermore, in both the Audit Committee and the full Supervisory Board, we examined 
the Board of Management’s proposal to use the unappropriated profit to pay a dividend of 
€ 8.50 for each share of common stock entitled to receive a dividend and € 8.52 for each 
share of preferred stock entitled to receive a dividend and to transfer the remaining amount 
to other revenue reserves. We consider the proposal appropriate and have therefore 
 approved it.
Based on the preparatory work of the Audit Committee, the Supervisory Board and the 
Board of Management jointly prepared the Remuneration Report for the financial year 
2022 in accordance with § 162 AktG. At the request of the Audit Committee, PwC reviewed 
the contents of the Remuneration Report, reported to both the Audit Committee and the 
Supervisory Board on the results of the review, and confirmed that the Remuneration Report 
complies with the financial reporting provisions contained in § 162 AktG in all material 
 respects. 
The Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board also carefully examined the combined 
Non-financial (Group) Statement for the year ended 31 December 2022. Following an in-
depth explanation of the statement by the Board of Management, representatives of PwC 
presented the key findings of their audit and answered additional questions posed by the 
members of the Supervisory Board. Based on the “limited assurance” audit performed by 
PwC on those parts of the Management Report and certain sustainability disclosures in 
the BMW Group Report 2022 that were not subject to a reasonable assurance engagement, 
PWC issued an unqualified opinion, signed for the first time by Michael Popp (Wirtschafts-
prüfer) and for the second time by Nicolette Behncke (Wirtschaftsprüferin). The Supervisory 
Board acknowledged and approved the combined Non-financial (Group) Statement drawn 
up by the Board of Management. Following a preparatory review conducted by the Presiding 
Board as well as a further review at Supervisory Board level, the Statement on Corporate 
Governance drawn up by the Board of Management was also approved by the Supervisory 
Board.
Expression of appreciation by the Supervisory Board 
In a year again marked by a set of particularly challenging circumstances, the Board of 
Management and the entire workforce can be proud of their achievements, which have 
helped take the BMW Group further along its path of automotive transformation. We there-
fore wish to express our deep thanks and appreciation to the members of the Board of 
Management and every single employee of the BMW  Group worldwide. 
We are confident that the Board of Management and the BMW Group’s workforce – moti-
vated by their determination to perform at an outstanding level and in a true spirit of 
 innovation – will continue to help extend the BMW Group’s competitive lead in the field of 
sustainable and digital mobility.

At the BMW Group – we move body, heart and mind.
Last year, I introduced you to our “North Star” – which defines our identity 
and our direction, and answers the question: “Why do we exist as a 
 company?” We move body, heart and mind. This idea also  encapsulates 
our impact on society as a value-based, value-creating company. We 
 deliver on our promises. You can continue to expect this from your Com-
pany in the future. It is what makes us special. In the first part of my 
statement, I will explain our mission through five hypotheses. In part two, 
I will show how your Company is setting itself up for the future and what

Using Connected Technologies to Expand the Freedom, Safety, and Excitement of a Smart Mobility Society
As cars rapidly developed and became commonplace 
in the 20th century, reducing fossil fuel consumption, 
cutting CO2 emissions to prevent global warming, and 
preventing air pollution gradually became the major 
social issues demanding global solutions that they are 
today. In response, many counties and regions have 
made plans to shift to electriﬁ ed vehicles, and auto-
makers are accelerating the development of such 
vehicles. Indeed, the electriﬁ cation of cars is an 
essential part of solving these challenges. 
  At the same time, new social issues are also 
emerging, such as increased trafﬁ c congestion due 
to rising population density in urban centers, shrink-
ing working populations and increased numbers of 
mobility-challenged individuals in developed coun-
tries due to demographic graying, and deepening 
logistics crises due to changes in consumer behavior.
In the midst of these social changes, the auto 
industry is entering a once-in-a-century period of 
profound transformation. Toyota provides freedom of 
movement—a form of social infrastructure. As such, 
we are ﬁ rmly determined to contribute to solving 
social issues by changing the very ways that people, 
things, and information ﬂ ow through the world. 
Based on this commitment, Toyota aims to connect 
cars, people, and communities and thereby create 
a smart mobility society that offers freedom of move-
ment, safety, and excitement for all.

Our Connected Strategy for Realizing 
Connected Platforms
Connecting cars is not only providing new value and 
services to customers, but creating new modes of 
use and new roles in society for cars. 
  To stay at the forefront of this evolution, Toyota 
established the in-house Connected Company in 
April 2016 and announced its Connected Strategy in 
November of the same year. This strategy comprises

new mobility services
lutionizing Toyota’s own 
businesses
The Start of the Full-Scale Connected 
Car Rollout
Key to the ﬁ rst arrow, connecting all cars, are our 
data communication modules (DCMs). In 2002, 
Toyota commercialized its DCMs and launched the 
G-BOOK service for Toyota vehicles (this service was 
replaced by T-Connect in 2014). In 2005, DCMs 
were made a standard feature in Lexus cars, and 
Toyota launched the G-Link service in Japan before 
expanding it to North America and China. As the ﬁ rst 
step toward connecting all vehicles, in June 2018, 
Toyota launched sales in Japan of the new Crown 
and Corolla Sport with DCMs as standard features 
for all grades. This marked the start of our full-scale 
roll out of connected cars. 
  Toyota plans to adopt common standards for its 
worldwide DCMs by 2019, equip virtually all passen-
ger vehicles it sells in Japan and the United States 
with DCMs by 2020, and steadily equip more vehi-
cles with DCMs in other major markets around the 
world going forward. 
Connected Technologies: Creating 
Services That Offer Safety and Peace of 
Mind to Customers and Society
Turning to the second arrow, as the number of con-
nected cars on the road increases, so does the big 
data they generate. Toyota is using this data to con-
tribute to the good of customers and society while 
revolutionizing its own businesses. 
  Aggregate route history maps were made publicly 
available after the Great East Japan Earthquake, and 
such data has subsequently been used in evacua-
tion, response, and recovery operations following 
several natural disasters. 
  Furthermore, by analyzing the diverse information 
collected from cars on the road using big data 
approaches, we will be able to utilize that information 
to create and enhance services that provide safety 
and peace of mind.
  Making DCMs standard features also makes our 
online services more convenient and easier to use for 
our customers. The voice recognition enabled artiﬁ -
cial intelligence (AI) virtual agent can understand pas-
sengers’ natural speech to set the destination for the 
navigation system and perform other tasks. Of 
course, we also have operators standing by 24 hours 
a day, 365 days a year, to provide more in-depth 
response to customer requests. By offering virtual 
(AI) and real-world (operators) service, Toyota seeks 
to provide what it calls “Human Connected Service.”
Route History Maps to the Rescue after 
Natural Disasters
Toyota’s route history maps use aggregate data on where cars 
have actually been collected from Toyota vehicles equipped with 
DCMs to provide trafﬁ c information in a map format. The data is 
constantly updated, and has been used to inform response dur-
ing and efforts after natural disasters.

Accelerating Cross-industry 
Collaboration as a Mobility Service 
Platform Provider
Under the third arrow, we are accelerating cross-
industry collaboration through the Mobility Service 
Platform (MSPF). Using the MSPF, Toyota is taking 
an open approach, linking with all kinds of service 
providers to contribute to the creation of new mobili-
ty services.
  We have already begun a range of collaborative ini-
tiatives. In May 2016, Toyota and Uber Technologies 
Inc. began to consider a partnership in ride-sharing. 
In 2017, we conducted a pilot program for our Smart 
Key Box with U.S. car-sharing company Getaround, 
Inc.; began a partnership with Grab Holdings Inc., 
the leading ride-hailing service company in Southeast 
Asia; and began veriﬁ cation testing of connected 
taxis with the Tokyo Taxi-Hire Association. In 2018, 
we are working to deepen these and other initiatives 
in order to create new mobility services and acceler-
ate their commercialization.
Efforts to Deepen Collaborations in 2018
Expanded Partnership with Grab in the Area Mobility as a Service 
In June 2018, Toyota concluded an agreement with Grab to 
strengthen our existing partnership in the area of Mobility as a 
Service (MaaS) in Southeast Asia and announced our decision 
to invest US$1 billion (approximately ¥110 billion) in Grab. 
  This expansion is aimed at expanding connected services 
across Southeast Asia. Speciﬁ cally, we aim to achieve con-
nectivity for Grab’s rental car ﬂ eet across the region and to 
utilize vehicle data collected by the MSPF to roll out driving-
data-based automotive insurance as well as ﬁ nancial servic-
es for Grab drivers and maintenance services currently 
under development.

  Going forward, the companies plan to steadily install 
Toyota’s TransLog data-transmitting driving recorder in more 
taxis, analyzing visual driving data from these devices to ﬁ nd 
factors that correlate with taxi demand and then working 
with the taxi dispatch support system to apply the results of 
this research.

Expanding Mobility Services in 
the Near Future
Toyota is analyzing and processing the big data generat-
ed by cars to create information that is useful for cus-
tomers and a variety of connected services. We want 
the car to be a seamless extension of customers’ 
phones and computers, a kind of personal assistant on 
wheels that is able to anticipate their needs using AI.
  Based on this concept, we created the e-Palette 
Concept Vehicle. Using connected and automated driv-
ing technologies, the e-Palette will serve as a common 
mobility platform that meets the needs of a wide range 
of service providers and business applications, including 
car-sharing, ride-sharing, parcel delivery, and retail. 
In other words, a single e-Palette Concept Vehicle 
could, depending on the time or other conditions, be 
used for a range of purposes by different operators. 
This is the vision of mobility service that the e-Palette 
makes possible. 
  Furthermore, vehicle information constantly gath-
ered through the MSPF will help optimize maintenance 
as well as the collection of data that can be used to 
anticipate demand for goods and services. Based on 
such capabilities, we are aiming to achieve the ulti-
mate in just-in-time service, in which, when a custom-
er summons an e-Palette Concept Vehicle, not only 
does it set out immediately, but it is already nearby. 
The technologies and expertise created in the 
AI-based dispatch system being tested in collabora-
tion with JapanTaxi, KDDI, and Accenture are being 
applied to enhance such demand prediction functions.
Creating Automated Driving 
Mobility Services 
In August 2018, Toyota and Uber announced an 
agreement to expand their collaboration with the prin-
cipal aim of advancing the development of and bring-
ing to market ride-sharing services leveraging 
automated driving technologies. To this end, Toyota’s 
Sienna Minivan will be modiﬁ ed to create the initial 
ﬂ eet of dedicated “Autono-MaaS” (autonomous 
mobility as a service) vehicles. These Autono-MaaS 
vehicles will be constantly connected to the MSPF 
and equipped with both Uber’s autonomous driving 
system and the Toyota Guardian automated safety 
support system. By using both systems together, we 
aim to better monitor vehicle surroundings in real time 
to realize even safer, more reliable automated driving 
mobility services. Deployments of these vehicles on 
the Uber ride-sharing network will begin in 2021. 
In October 2018, Toyota and SoftBank Corp. 
agreed to form a strategic partnership to facilitate the 
creation of new mobility services. The two companies 
plan to establish a joint venture company, MONET 
Technologies Corporation, before the end of ﬁ scal 
2019. MONET will provide coordination between 
Toyota’s MSPF and SoftBank’s IoT Platform. By utiliz-
ing a wide range of data related to the movement of 
people and vehicles, MONET will seek to optimally 
balance supply and demand in transportation and 
launch new MaaS businesses capable of resolving 
mobility-related social issues and creating new value. 
Through MONET, we plan to roll out Autono-MaaS 
businesses based on e-Palette by the mid-2020s.

Strengthening Our Competitiveness to Deliver Ever-Better Mobility to Customers around the World
Toyota believes that the true value of mobility is the 
freedom it enables. No matter how times change, 
Toyota’s love of cars will never fade. At the same 
time, our passion for mobility is not limited to cars. 
Technologies for making transport easier, more 
 convenient, and more enjoyable for people around 
the world are evolving, and the value that Toyota 
 provides is expanding on numerous fronts. This is 
why Toyota announced its intention to transform into 
a mobility company. 
  As Toyota works to reinforce its efforts related to 
a wide range of mobility services, its approach of 
seeking to be the “best in town” will be essential. 
When creating new services, the business environ-
ment, particular challenges, and distributors in each 
region vary greatly. Toyota must provide cars and 
mobility services that are closely tailored to customer 
lifestyles and regional characteristics and make itself 
an indispensable presence in local communities. 
Seeking to be the best in town is an approach that 
reinforces competitiveness and thereby leads to 
 sustained growth. 
In this way, Toyota’s vision is extremely clear. 
  To achieve this vision with emphasis on speed and 
openness, Toyota is working to reform businesses 
throughout the Group—and sometimes extending 
beyond the Group—based on a “home and away” 
perspective. “Home” refers to operations and regions 
in which we can add value ourselves through Genchi 
Genbutsu (onsite, hands-on experience) and in which 
we have competitive advantages over our rivals. 
  “Away,” meanwhile, refers to operations and 
regions in which we will work with other companies 
that have more advantages than we do in terms of 
expertise. By reexamining our businesses and effec-
tively allocating management resources to “home” 
and “away” companies, we can increase productivity 
and make the entire Toyota Group more competitive. 
And, above all, Toyota believes that applying Genchi 
Genbutsu in their work at more specialized compa-
nies will help our human resources grow and develop.
  Furthermore, under the “home and away” 
approach, we will transcend the borders of the 
Group’s operations. By developing working relation-
ships with other companies which have same aspira-
tions with us, we can make an enormous impact in 
this time of immense change. 
If it’s not fun, it’s not a car. As the value consumers 
seek in cars diversiﬁ es, Toyota will continue to listen 
carefully to its customers, reinforce its competitive-
ness, and deliver ever-better mobility to even more 
customers.
Shifting to a Region-based Approach 
in Japan, Toyota’s Home Market
Conditions in Japan’s automotive market are expect-
ed to become more difﬁ cult than ever. The market is 
contracting as a result of such social issues as the 
declining and graying population, urbanization, and 
rural depopulation. At the same time, the market is 
changing, with increased use of IT, AI, automated 
driving, and other technological innovations, as well 
as the emergence of new rivals. 
  To adapt to future market changes, Toyota launched 
in 2016 the J-ReBORN Plan under which it has been 
working to transform the domestic car sales business.
  Until now, Toyota’s growth in the Japanese market 
has been based on sales efforts that were focused 
on channels and uniformly implemented nationwide.  
  Going forward, however, we will need to look more 
closely at Japan’s individual regions. We must 
 understand the desires of and problems faced by the 
 people living in each region and work to solve those 
problems in collaboration with not just our dealers 
and members of the Toyota Group, but also regional 
governments and local companies. As such, in 
January 2018, we reorganized the Japan Sales 
Business Group. Also, we changed our domestic 
sales policies, moving from a uniform approach 
throughout the country to a focus on individual 
regions, and are speedily carrying out said policies.
  Furthermore, to strengthen our competitiveness 
and to create and provide new mobility services, in 
addition to ongoing business reinforcement efforts, 
we established Toyota Mobility Service Co., Ltd. in 
April 2018. This new subsidiary will develop and 
 provide solution services for corporate customers, 
connected services using communications devices 
in cars, car sharing, and other new services. 
  Tokyo, in particular, is the earliest adopter of mobil-
ity service, seeing a shift from car ownership to car 
usage. Targeting the Tokyo region, we plan to inte-
grate Tokyo Toyota Motor Co., Ltd., Tokyo Toyopet 
Motor Sales Co., Ltd., Toyota Tokyo Corolla Co., 
Ltd., and Netz Toyota Tokyo Co., Ltd., to form a new 
company in 2019. By efﬁ ciently developing its dealer 
network and by concentrating its resources, Toyota 
will continue working to be the best in town.

Dear Shareholders,
2021 was a year in which we once again accelerated the implementation of our strategy and 
translated it into fascinating products and financial success. At the same time, we were able to 
further increase our financial resilience. This has been key to steering the company through 
industry-wide challenges – from the ongoing pandemic to global semiconductor supply short-
ages. We also successfully achieved an historical milestone: the spin-off and hive-down of the 
Daimler commercial vehicle business. As a well-focused company, we in the Mercedes-Benz 
Group AG can make even better use of the opportunities that lie ahead. We are a vehicle manu-
facturer – and we are proud to be. This is now also reflected in the name of the company.
Last year, a total of 2.3 million customers opted for a passenger car or a van with a star. Our 
 revenue amounted to €168.0 billion. EBIT increased by 340% to €29.1 billion. Our net liquidity in 
the industrial business amounted to €21.0 billion. The bottom line was a net profit of €23.4 bil-
lion. The Board of Management and the Supervisory Board will propose a dividend of €5.00 per 
share to the Shareholders' Meeting. 
For this performance, gratitude is due to all colleagues. The past year was characterised by a 
challenging environment and high volatility. We successfully countered this – with strict 
 discipline and great flexibility. This tremendous commitment and a strong team spirit are also 
crucial to continue the success story. 
As we look ahead, we need to limit the impact of supply shortages, counter rising commodity 
prices, and continue to work on our cost efficiency. In addition, we pursue clear strategic priori-
ties: we want to scale e-mobility, accelerate software development, and further strengthen 
Mercedes-Benz as a leading luxury brand. 
We continue to focus on the electrification of our products. This year, we are presenting two 
all-electric off-road vehicles. It is important to ensure a smooth launch. At the same time, we 
need to scale our electric vehicles. This year, we are going to offer an electric alternative in all 
segments. We plan to increase our share of electrified vehicles to account for up to 50% for 
overall sales by 2025. And by the end of this decade, we are going to be ready to switch com-
pletely to electric, where market conditions permit this. Our Maybach, AMG, and G-Class brands 
are also becoming all-electric. We are significantly expanding our global activities in battery 
8

--- Page 9 ---
cells and battery systems in order to make these plans successful. With the presentation of the 
Vision EQXX, we reinforced our claim to be the innovative leader in electromobility. The concept 
car gives a glimpse of what may be possible in the future in terms of efficiency and electric range.
Our second technological spearhead is acceleration in the area of software. In particular, this 
also implies the expansion of our competence in this area. We are creating up to 3,000  
new jobs worldwide – a significant proportion of these at our centre of excellence for software 
in Sindelfingen. There we want to push the development of our own operating system in a 
 bundled effort. And in automated driving, we are launching the next stage: Mercedes-Benz is 
the first manufacturer in the world to receive internationally valid system approval to introduce 
highly automated driving functions at level 3 to series production cars. That is what we will do 
in Germany this year.
The technological change is the basis for the successful transformation of Mercedes-Benz into 
an automotive brand in the luxury segment. The initial position is excellent: innovative technology, 
emotional design, and attention to detail – this is what Mercedes-Benz has represented for  
over 100 years. With the new structure, we have bundled our strength. Our ultimate goal: to 
build the most desirable cars and vans in the world. This transformation did not start today and it 
will not be done tomorrow – it is the responsibility of our generation. And that is where unique 
opportunities lie. In this context, the Mercedes star is a promise for the future: we want to 
change what exists in order to improve it. This is the spirit that our founding fathers gave us. 
We will carry on their legacy. I look forward to you joining us on this journey. 
Yours, 
Ola Källenius

Report of the  
Supervisory Board
Dear Shareholders,
In the year 2021, Daimler AG set its strategic course for the future. With the successful spin-off 
and hive-down of the Daimler commercial vehicle business, two powerful and independent 
companies with a clear profile were created. In the future, both Mercedes-Benz Cars & Vans  
and Daimler Trucks & Buses will be able to focus even more strongly on their specific business 
areas and thus generate added value for customers, employees, investors and partners. How-
ever, a common goal will continue to unite the two companies: the transformation towards a 
zero-emission and software-driven future. This year, Mercedes-Benz has made substantial  
progress in the implementation of its business strategy and intensified its ambition towards an 
all-electric product portfolio. At the same time, the positioning of Mercedes-Benz as a  sustain- 
able luxury brand was expanded further. 
However, 2021 also presented the Company with major challenges. The pandemic-related 
 disruptions in the global supply chains led to noticeable supply bottlenecks for certain semi- 
conductor components, as a result of which the continued high-level of demand from 
 customers could, despite great efforts, not entirely be met. However, the extraordinary commit-
ment of the Board of Management, the executives, and all employees ensured a positive 
 business development.
For me personally, the last few months as Chairman of the Supervisory Board have shown that 
the management makes the right decisions, even in difficult times. The company has already made 
good progress on the road to transformation and I confidently look forward to the coming years.

Supervisory and advisory activities of the  
Supervisory Board
In the 2021 financial year, the Supervisory Board of 
Mercedes-Benz Group AG again performed, in full, the 
duties incumbent upon it by law, the Articles of Incor-
poration and the rules of procedure.
In this context, the Supervisory Board continuously 
advised and monitored the Board of Management in the 
management of the company and provided support on 
strategically important issues for the further develop-
ment of the Company.
The Supervisory Board reviewed whether the individual 
company and consolidated financial statements, the 
combined management report including the non-finan-
cial declaration and the other financial reporting com-
plied with the applicable requirements.
Furthermore, after careful review and consultation, it 
approved numerous business transactions subject to its 
consent. This related in particular to the approval of the 
implementation of the historic restructuring of the Com-
pany through the spin-off and hive-down of the Daimler 
commercial vehicle business as part of Project Focus. 
This also included financial and investment planning, 
cooperation projects and the conclusion of contracts of 
particular importance to the Company. The Board of 
Management informed the Supervisory Board about a 
large number of other measures and business transac-
tions and discussed them intensively and in detail with 
the Supervisory Board, for example, the effects on the 
Company of supply bottlenecks for certain semiconduc-
tor components and the initiated countermeasures. 
The Board of Management regularly informed the Super-
visory Board about all significant business develop-
ments of the Group and the divisions. During the report-
ing period, it kept the Supervisory Board continuously 
informed about all fundamental issues regarding corpo-
rate planning, including financial, investment, sales and 
personnel planning, current developments at Group 
companies, the development of revenue, the situation 
of the Company and the divisions, the economic and 
political environment, and the current status and 
assessment of significant legal proceedings. In addition, 
the Board of Management continuously reported to the 
Supervisory Board on the profitability and liquidity 
situation of the Group, the development of sales and 
procurement markets, the overall economic situation 
and developments on the capital markets and in the 
financial services sector. Other topics included the fur-
ther development of the product portfolio, securing the 
long-term competitiveness of the Group and the further 
implementation of measures to ensure sustain- 
able, future-oriented mobility. The Supervisory Board 
also dealt in detail with the political developments and 
conflicts in the main sales markets, the shareholder 
structure, the share-price development and its back-
ground, as well as the expected effects of the strategic 
projects on the share-price development. 
Working culture and areas of Supervisory Board 
activity
In the 2021 financial year, the Supervisory Board held 
nine meetings, which were also held as video confer-
ences due to the pandemic. Meeting attendance by the 
members was again at a very high level, as can be seen 
in the detailed overview at the end of this report. The 
work of the Supervisory Board was characterised by 
open and intensive dialogue. The members of the 
Supervisory Board regularly prepared for upcoming res-
olutions using documents provided in advance by the 
Board of Management. The employee and shareholder 
representatives also regularly prepared the meetings in 
separate discussions, which were also attended by 
members of the Board of Management. In addition, the 
Supervisory Board was supported in depth by its Com-
mittees. At the meetings of the Supervisory Board, its 
members discussed the measures and transactions to 
be resolved in detail with the Board of Management. 
Executive sessions were regularly scheduled for the 
meetings so that topics could be discussed also in the 
absence of the Board of Management.
The Supervisory Board was informed of special events 
outside the regular meetings. In addition, the members 
of the Supervisory Board and the Board of Management 
held bilateral meetings to exchange views. The Board  
of Management also informed the Supervisory Board of 
the key indicators of business developments and  
of existing risks with written reports.

commitment to develop and support our people 
and we offer the Group Management Board our 
wholehearted support in realising that ambition.”
Connecting customers to opportunities
The financial targets that John announced in  
June remain appropriate, even as the global 
economic outlook becomes less predictable.  
Our ability to meet them depends on being  
able to help our customers manage the present 
uncertainty and capture the opportunities  
that unquestionably exist.
The system of global trade remains subject to 
political pressure, and differences between  
China and the US will likely continue to inform 
sentiment in 2019. However, the conclusion  
of major trade agreements – including the 
Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement  
for Trans-Pacific Partnership; the EU’s landmark 
bilateral agreements with Japan and Singapore; 
and the potential ratification of the US-Mexico-
Canada Agreement in 2019 – provide important 
counterweights that could give impetus to 
international trade in the year ahead.
The fundamentals for growth in Asia remain strong 
in spite of a softer regional economic outlook. The 
structural and financial reforms underway across 
the region should continue to support economic 
development. China remains subject to domestic 
and external pressures, but we expect it to maintain 
strong growth. We also expect further financial 
liberalisation to form part of China’s response to 
changing external conditions. This will benefit 
domestic and international customers and investors.
The US economy and the influence of the Federal 
Reserve remain central to global sentiment. We 
expect policymakers to adopt a more cautious 
stance in 2019, even as the economy continues  
to grow. A slowdown in the pace of US interest 
rate rises could carry positive implications for  
Asian economies and businesses, as well as  
for US growth. Both the Mexican and Canadian 
economies are poised to grow at a steady pace.
Many of our UK customers are understandably 
cautious about the immediate future, given the 
prolonged uncertainty surrounding the UK’s exit 
from the European Union. HSBC UK, our new  
UK ring-fenced bank, has an important role in 
supporting our customers as they prepare for a 
range of possible outcomes. Our universal banking 
business in France will also help provide continuity 
to our customers in the UK and the rest of Europe. 
In Europe, as elsewhere, we are confident in our 
ability to help customers make the most of the 
opportunities they see.
There are more risks to global economic growth 
than this time last year, and we remain alive and 
responsive to all possibilities. Our strong balance 
sheet and revenue base equip us to navigate these 
risks and, most importantly, enable us to help our 
customers negotiate their own paths.

Fulfilling our potential
Many thanks
Enabling our people to do their jobs to the best  
of their ability is a priority for the Board, and for  
me personally. They are essential to our present 
and future success. The Board fully endorses the 
Group’s commitment to develop and support our 
people and we offer the Group Management  
Board our wholehearted support in realising  
that ambition.
My thanks go to John and each of the 235,000 
people who work for HSBC. Their hard work, 
commitment and talent has been key to the 
Group’s progress in 2018. Our challenge and 
shared purpose is to build on that good work 
through the rest of 2019 and beyond. I have  
every confidence we can do so.
“ Our strong balance sheet and revenue base 
equip us to navigate these risks and, most 
importantly, enable us to help our customers 
negotiate their own paths.”
Mark E Tucker
Group Chairman
19 February 2019
I had the honour of officially opening the new 
headquarters of HSBC UK in Birmingham in 
December. As well as providing a new home for 
the UK ring-fenced bank, One Centenary Square 
houses the European hub of HSBC University,  
our global learning and development centre.  
Since then, we have opened new HSBC University 
hubs at our new premises in Dubai, and in Mexico  
City. These cutting-edge facilities form part of  
our response to the complex challenges our 
employees now face working for a global bank  
in an unpredictable environment. HSBC University 
aims not only to equip them with the right skills, 
but also to help them understand the culture that 
will continue to make HSBC a unique organisation.

Group Chief Executive’s 
review
Helping our people be at their best is the critical enabler 
of our business strategy and fundamental to delivering 
our financial targets.
John Flint Group Chief Executive
In June 2018, I set out a plan to get HSBC growing 
again and to create value for shareholders. While 
this targets clear financial outcomes, it has our 
customers at its centre. We want to bring more  
of HSBC to more people and to serve them in the 
best possible way.
“ We want to bring more of HSBC to  
more people and to serve them in the  
best possible way.”
The eight strategic priorities that I outlined  
in June are the key to achieving these aims.  
We are seeking to connect more customers  
to our international network and high-growth 
markets. We are working to improve our capital 
efficiency and to turn our US business around.  
We are investing in technology and our digital 
capabilities to serve our customers better and  
stay competitive. We are also taking steps to 
support our people more effectively and help  
them be at their best.
I am encouraged by our progress so far. We  
are growing customer numbers and capturing 
market share in our scale markets and from our 
international network. Our US business is short  
of where we want it to be, but is moving in the 
right direction. Our investment in technology is 
making our business simpler, safer, and easier  
for our customers to use. We have launched new 
products and made strategic hires in mainland 
China and Hong Kong that are materially improving 
our service to international clients. We have also 
established our UK ring-fenced bank.
These were important factors in our 2018 financial 
performance. Revenue growth in our four global 
businesses helped deliver higher Group reported 
and adjusted profit before tax. Group return on 
tangible equity – our headline measure – was also 
up significantly from 6.8% in 2017 to 8.6%. This is  
a good first step towards meeting our return on 
tangible equity target of more than 11% by 2020.
Engaging our people
HSBC has a strong and proud culture. We 
understand our role and our purpose, and that 
HSBC exists to serve others. As Group Chief 
Executive, I have a responsibility to nurture and 
preserve those aspects of our culture that serve  
us well. I also recognise that I have a responsibility 
to improve aspects of our behaviours that may  
be impeding our performance.
In my first year in this role, I started a conversation 
throughout the bank about how we help our 
people be the best version of themselves. This is 
part of a broader ambition to create what we call 
the healthiest human system in our industry.
7

--- Page 10 ---
Strategic Report | Group Chief Executive’s review
There is more that we can do to create an 
environment that is sufficiently supportive, 
protective and engaging. We need to have more 
open and honest conversations. This is the least 
that our people should be able to expect. If we 
cannot provide it, it hurts our ability to serve not 
just our customers, but all the stakeholder groups 
on whom our success depends. It also impedes 
our ability to deliver our strategy and our targets.
We have started by signalling to our people  
that creating a safe and supportive working 
environment is a strategic priority for the business. 
Leaders are being encouraged to model the right 
behaviours and provide direction on the type of 
behaviour we expect. We are also opening 
conversations around issues like mental  
health, well-being, bullying and harassment.
We are making material changes to the 
organisation that allow us to support our people 
more effectively. Our governance procedures  
are being simplified and strengthened to reduce 
complexity and make it easier for people to do their 
jobs. We are also helping our people work more 
flexibly. On learning and development, we have 
opened new HSBC University hubs around the 
world and improved access to digital training.
“ HSBC has a strong and proud culture.  
We understand our role and our purpose,  
and that HSBC exists to serve others.”
At an individual level, every person at HSBC  
is being encouraged to think about how we  
create the healthiest human system in our  
industry, and to play an active role in doing so.  
We are regularly collecting feedback from our 
people and it is informing the action we are taking.
The early signs are positive. In 2018, 66% of our 
employees said they would recommend HSBC  
as a great place to work, up from 64% the previous 
year. While this demonstrates an improvement in  
a relatively short space of time, it also shows that 
we have much further to go. This work will 
continue into 2019 and beyond. If we are 
successful, then we will materially improve  
all aspects of HSBC’s performance, including 
delivery of our strategy.
Business performance
All four global businesses grew adjusted  
revenue in 2018.
Retail Banking and Wealth Management had  
a very good year. Higher interest rates, rising 
customer numbers, and growth of more than 
$20bn in our UK and Hong Kong mortgage book  
all contributed to a strong rise in Retail Banking 
adjusted revenue. Despite a good performance  
in the first three quarters of the year, Wealth 
Management adjusted revenue fell slightly in  
2018 due to the effects of market volatility in  
the fourth quarter.
Commercial Banking had an excellent 2018, 
delivering double-digit adjusted revenue growth  
on the back of an outstanding performance in 
Global Liquidity and Cash Management. Credit  
and Lending generated adjusted revenue growth 
from higher balances, despite lower margins from 
increased competition. Solid performances in Asia 
and Europe enabled Global Trade and Receivables 
Finance to grow adjusted revenue despite an 
increasingly difficult environment for trade.
Global Banking and Markets grew adjusted 
revenue in spite of considerably reduced market 
activity in the fourth quarter. Our market-leading 
transaction banking franchises generated strong 
increases in adjusted revenue, which exceeded  
the reduction in markets-related revenue from 
Rates, Credit, and Equities.
Global Private Banking returned to growth in 2018 
on the back of new business won in Hong Kong. 
Adjusted revenue from deposits also increased on 
the back of interest rate rises.
Adjusted jaws was negative for 2018. While 
adjusted costs were broadly as we expected for  
the full year, adjusted revenue fell short due to 
market weakness in the fourth quarter. Positive 
jaws remains an important discipline in delivering 
our financial targets and we remain committed  
to it in 2019.
8

--- Page 11 ---
Group Chief Executive’s review
Expected credit losses were slightly higher than 
loan impairment charges in 2017, reflecting the 
uncertain economic outlook in the UK  
and heightened downside risks.
We plan to achieve positive adjusted jaws in 2019 
and remain focused on achieving a return on 
tangible equity of over 11% by 2020, while 
maintaining a stable dividend.
Our common equity tier 1 ratio of 14% was lower 
than at the same point in 2017, due mainly to 
adverse foreign exchange movements and the 
impact of higher lending.
“ Despite more challenging market conditions at 
the end of year and a weaker global economic 
outlook, we are committed to the targets we 
announced in June.”
John Flint
Group Chief Executive
19 February 2019
We returned a total of $2bn to shareholders 
through share buy-backs in 2018, reflecting our 
desire to neutralise the impact of scrip dividends 
over the medium term. We remain committed  
to this policy, subject to regulatory approval.
Outlook
We have made a good start to 2019. Our Group 
revenue performance in January was ahead of our 
plan for the month and actual credit performance 
remained robust, albeit with some softening of 
credit performance in the UK. We continue to 
prepare for the UK’s departure from the EU in  
order to provide continuity for our customers in  
the UK and mainland Europe. Our well-established 
universal bank in France gives us a major 
advantage in this regard. Our immediate priority  
is to help our customers manage the present 
uncertainty.
Despite more challenging market conditions at  
the end of the year and a weaker global economic 
outlook, we are committed to the targets we 
announced in June. We remain alert to the 
downside risks of the current economic 
environment, especially those relating to the UK 
economy, global trade tensions and the future path 
of interest rates. We will be proactive in managing 
costs and investment to meet the risks to revenue 
growth where necessary, but we will not take 
short-term decisions that harm the long-term 
interests of the business.

Client examples

CLP Holdings Limited (‘CLP’): 
power and utilities, Hong Kong
Imagination, a creative agency 
and fast-growing global authority 
on brand experience, found  
itself outgrowing its banking 
relationship and constrained  
by its bank’s local focus. HSBC 
provided Imagination with the 
benefits of a robust international 
network including greater access 
to debt and liquidity, an optimised 
banking experience across 10 
countries through HSBCnet, and 
an integration with Imagination’s 
enterprise resource planning 
system for holistic viewing of 
transactions and account details.
Euroimmun was acquired by a  
US medical technology company.  
Both companies were long-standing 
CMB clients, so HSBC was 
mandated with settlement of the 
consideration. An introduction to 
HSBC’s GPB business in Germany 
led to Euroimmun’s largest 
shareholder and its Chief Financial 
Officer placing the majority of sale 
proceeds with GPB. Through 
collaboration between our CMB, 
GB&M and GPB businesses, we 
were able to provide multi-product 
solutions during critical events for 
the client.
CLP, a Hong Kong-listed pan-Asian 
power business, is committed  
to supporting the Hong Kong 
government’s target to reduce carbon 
intensity by 65–70% by 2030 from 
2005 levels. HSBC has assisted CLP  
as Sole Adviser in establishing the  
‘CLP climate action finance framework’ 
to attract qualified investments in  
the transitioning to a low-carbon 
economy. Under this framework, HSBC 
acted as a joint bookrunner on the 
debut $500m Reg S Energy Transition 
Bond issued by Castle Peak Power 
Company Limited, to help finance  
the development of a new gas-fired 
generation unit in Hong Kong.

Strategic Report
Strategic priorities
We entered the next phase of our strategy in 2018, focused on growth and 
creating value for our stakeholders. 
Return to growth and value creation
In our June 2018 Strategy Update,  
we outlined eight strategic priorities  
to deliver growth, improve returns, 
empower our people, and enhance our 
customer experience. Each priority has  
a target or set of targeted outcomes  
by 2020. The table opposite contains  
a summary of our progress, with 
additional details provided below.
purchasing of homes, as we grew our 
mortgage market share to 6.6%8. For  
our corporate clients, we launched our 
largest ever dedicated SME fund, with 
£12bn of funding, including £1bn of 
funding to help UK companies grow 
overseas. While HSBC UK has seen  
initial growth in retail customers (up  
by 251,000, a growth of 2%), we are  
still driving initiatives to grow our 
commercial customer base.
Growth from areas of strength
Strategic priority 1: We made a strong 
start in accelerating growth from our 
Asian franchise after making select 
investments in areas such as Hong 
Kong and our wealth business. Overall, 
Asia adjusted revenue was 11% higher 
than the previous year with double-
digit growth in Hong Kong, mainland 
China and the Pearl River Delta. 
Despite some market uncertainty, we 
continued to support customers as  
we increased loan balances by 9%.  
Our wealth business in Asia7 gained 
positive momentum with double-digit 
revenue growth in Private Banking and 
Asset Management, and 4% growth in 
RBWM Wealth distribution. However, 
Asia Insurance manufacturing revenue 
was down 11% versus 2017 due to 
adverse market conditions.
We continue to support clients and 
economies through the China-led Belt 
and Road Initiative, and FinanceAsia 
recognised our market leadership by 
awarding us the ‘Best Belt and Road 
Bank’ in Asia for the second 
consecutive year.
In sustainable finance, our goal is  
to be a leading partner for our clients  
to help the world’s transition to a 
low-carbon economy. We have made 
good progress with our ambition  
to provide $100bn of sustainable 
financing, facilitation and investment 
by 2025, with a cumulative total of 
$28.5bn delivered in 2017 and 2018. 
For further details on our sustainable 
finance commitment, see page 27.
Strategic priority 2: We completed  
the set-up of our UK ring-fenced bank, 
HSBC UK, six months ahead of the  
legal deadline, and we opened our  
new UK head office in Birmingham.  
We supported our retail customers’ 
12
Strategic priority 3: We continue to  
make investments to enable growth in  
our international network. In Global Trade 
and Receivables Finance (‘GTRF’), we  
are investing in a transformation of our 
operating model to help clients and 
colleagues conduct trade and manage 
capital more efficiently. In Securities 
Services, we are developing our digital 
proposition across many products.  
We are on track to achieve our target  
of mid to high single-digit revenue 
growth by 2020. International client 
revenue was up 7% compared with  
2017; transaction banking revenue  
grew 14%, driven by double-digit  
growth across Global Liquidity and  
Cash Management (‘GLCM’), Foreign 
Exchange and Securities Services.  
GTRF revenue grew by 2%, reflecting  
the subdued global trade environment.
Turnaround of low-return 
businesses
Strategic priority 4: The US turnaround  
is our most challenging strategic priority. 
Our US return on tangible equity (‘RoTE’) 
increased from 0.9% to 2.7%, supported  
by favourable expected credit losses, and 
capital released to HSBC Holdings. 
However, significant improvement is 
required to achieve our 2020 targeted 
outcome of greater than 6% RoTE in the US. 
Investments in our platforms and products 
are supporting organic growth. Our active 
customer base in RBWM increased by 
nearly 200,000 to 1.3 million people. We 
grew CMB revenue by 7% and transaction 
banking revenue in GB&M by 9%.
Strategic priority 5: To enhance returns for 
our shareholders, we have committed to 
improving our capital efficiency. In 2018, 
our revenue over risk-weighted assets 
(‘RWAs’) ratio grew by 0.3 percentage 
points to 6.2%, driven by broad-based 
revenue growth across our four global 
businesses. We continue to redeploy 
RWAs to higher-return businesses.
Putting the customer at the centre
Strategic priority 6: We aim to create  
the capacity to invest in growth and 
technology through a combination of  
cost discipline and revenue growth. We 
did not achieve our target of positive 
adjusted jaws in 2018, in part due to 
unexpected market volatility in the last 
two months of the year, which impacted 
revenue. However, we remain committed 
to the discipline of positive adjusted jaws. 
Our revenue growth helped support 
$4.1bn in investment for business growth, 
productivity, regulatory and mandatory 
purposes. We are already seeing results, 
with approximately 45% of retail 
customers now digitally active and  
more than 30% of sales through digital 
channels9. In CMB, we halved the 
onboarding time to an average of  
11 days for clients.
Strategic priority 7: We exist, at our  
core, to serve our customers and we 
made a commitment in June 2018 to 
improve customer service in our eight 
‘scale markets’10. We are measuring  
our performance against customer 
satisfaction indices. In 2018, six markets  
in RBWM and three markets in CMB 
sustained a top-three rank and/or 
improved by two ranks in customer 
satisfaction.
Empower our people
Strategic priority 8: We have committed  
to simplifying the organisation and 
investing in the future skills of our 
employees. We continue to improve our 
employee engagement, as reflected in the 
improvement of our employee advocacy  
by two percentage points to 66%. Our 
ESG rating is derived from the impact we 
have on our wider stakeholders. We are 
currently rated an ‘Average performer’, 
and we are driving several initiatives  
to achieve an ‘Outperformer’ rating. 
Information on how we are empowering 
our people can be found in the ‘How we 
do business’ section on pages 22 to 29, 
with additional details in our ESG Update 
in April 2019.

Strategic Report
Financial overview
Reported results
This table shows our reported results for 
the last three years ended 31 December 
2018, 2017 and 2016.
HSBC adopted the requirements  
of IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ on  
1 January 2018, with the exception of  
the provisions relating to the presentation 
of gains and losses on financial liabilities 
designated at fair value, which were 
adopted on 1 January 2017.
Under IFRS 9, the recognition and 
measurement of expected credit losses 
differs from the approach under IAS 39. 
The change in expected credit losses 
relating to financial assets under IFRS 9 is 
recorded in the income statement under 
‘change in expected credit losses and 
other credit impairment charges’ (‘ECL’). 
As prior periods have not been restated, 
changes in impairment of financial assets 
in the comparative periods remain in 
accordance with IAS 39 and are 
recorded in the income statement under 
‘loan impairment charges and other 
credit risk provisions’ (‘LICs’) and are 
therefore not necessarily comparable  
to ECL recorded for the current period. 
All commentary in this financial overview 
compares the 2018 results with 2017, 
unless otherwise stated. 
Reported profit before tax 
Reported profit before tax of $19.9bn was 
$2.7bn or 16% higher, mainly reflecting 
growth in revenue. Operating expenses 
fell by $0.2bn, as increases, mainly 
associated with investments to grow the 
business, were more than offset by a net 
favourable movement in significant items, 
which included the non-recurrence of our 
costs to achieve programme.
Reported profit before tax included a net 
favourable movement of significant items 
of $2.1bn, which is described in more detail 
on page 34. Excluding these items and  
a favourable effect of foreign currency 
translation differences of $0.1bn, profit 
before tax increased by $0.6bn or 3%.
Reported revenue
Reported revenue of $53.8bn was 
$2.3bn or 5% higher, which reflected 
revenue growth in all global businesses, 
although revenue fell in Corporate 
Centre. The increase in reported revenue 
included a favourable effect of foreign

currency translation differences of 
$0.1bn, broadly offset by a net adverse 
movement in significant items of $0.1bn.
Significant items included: 
 – a net loss on disposals, acquisitions and 
investment in new businesses of $0.1bn 
in 2018, compared with a net gain of 
$0.3bn in 2017.
This was partly offset by:
 – a net release of provisions related to 
customer redress programmes in the 
UK of $0.1bn in 2018, compared with 
net charges of $0.1bn in 2017; and
 – lower adverse fair value movements  
on financial instruments (up $0.1bn).
Excluding significant items and foreign 
currency translation differences, revenue 
increased by $2.3bn or 4%.
Reported ECL/LICs
movement in significant items of $2.1bn. 
Significant items included:
 – the non-recurrence of costs to achieve, 
which were $3.0bn in 2017; and
 – customer redress programme costs of 
$0.1bn in 2018, compared with $0.7bn 
in 2017.
These were partly offset by:
 – settlements and provisions in 
connection with legal and regulatory 
matters of $0.8bn in 2018. This 
compared with a net release of  
$0.2bn in 2017;
 – a provision in relation to past service 
costs of guaranteed minimum pension 
benefits equalisation of $0.2bn in  
2018; and
 – the non-recurrence of gains on  
the partial settlement of pension 
obligations of $0.2bn in 2017.
In 2018, reported ECL of $1.8bn related 
mainly to RBWM ($1.2bn), notably in 
Mexico, the UK and Asia, as well as  
CMB ($0.7bn).
Excluding significant items and adverse 
foreign currency translation differences 
of $0.1bn, operating expenses increased 
by $1.8bn or 6%.
In 2017, reported LICs were $1.8bn, 
notably in RBWM ($1.0bn) as well as  
in CMB ($0.5bn) and GB&M ($0.5bn). 
This was partly offset by net releases  
in Corporate Centre of $0.2bn.
Foreign currency translation differences 
between the periods were $0.1bn 
favourable.
Reported operating expenses
Reported operating expenses of $34.7bn 
were $0.2bn or 1% lower, as an increase 
in operating expenses from near- and 
medium-term investments to grow  
the business, together with higher 
performance-related pay, were more 
than offset by a net favourable 
Reported share of profit in 
associates and joint ventures
Reported share of profit in associates  
of $2.5bn was $0.2bn or 7% higher, 
primarily reflecting an increase in income 
from Bank of Communications Co., 
Limited (‘BoCom’). 
Excluding the favourable effect of foreign 
currency translation differences of $41m, 
share of profit in associates increased  
by $0.1bn.
Dividends
On 19 February 2019, the Board 
announced a fourth interim dividend  
of $0.21 per ordinary share.

Looking  ahead,  the  situation  remains  challenging.  The  tech-
nological  change  in  our  industry  –  from  e-mobility  through 
to digitalization, connectivity, new mobility solutions, and on 
to  automated  driving  –  is  going  to  take  a  lot  of  energy  and 
financial resources. We want to shape this development from 
the  top.  Therefore,  we  are  realigning  our  activities.  We  will 
increase  our  efficiency  and  competitiveness,  pick  up  speed 
and revise our cost structures. 
The coming years will be guided by our electric campaign. We 
are  committed  to  the  Paris  Agreement  and  to  making  our 
contribution  to  protecting  people  and  the  environment. 
We’re planning investments of around €30 billion in electric 
mobility in the next five years. Our emphasis is on the elec-
tric  car,  because  from  today’s  perspective  it  is  the  best  and 
most efficient choice for reducing CO2 in transport. By 2025, 
we will put 50 new electric models on the road. By then, every 
fourth  car  in  our  range  will  be  an  electric  model.  With  the 
Volkswagen ID., we will soon offer the first vehicle with a CO2-
neutral  supply  chain  and  production.  This  will  also  change 
the  face  of  our  plants:  Zwickau,  Emden  and  Hanover  will  be 
transformed  into  pure-play  electric  car  plants,  forming 
Europe’s  largest  electric  production  network.  In  China,  too, 
the  conversion  of  the  Anting  and  Foshan  plants  is  in  full 
swing.  The  production  launch  of  electric  cars  in  North 
America is planned for 2022. 
infotainment  to  fully  autonomous  driving:  software  will 
shape  the  car  of  tomorrow.  To  be  globally  successful,  com-
panies need economies of scale, and as a leading company in 
the  sector,  Volkswagen  has  the  necessary  size.  What  we  are 
lacking  in  many  areas  is  software  expertise.  We  are  taking 
steps to acquire these skills by forging alliances with partners, 
increasing resources at full speed, revising our structures and 
changing  our  workflows.  We  are  the  first  established  auto-
maker  to  separate  hardware  from  software  development.  At 
the Volkswagen brand, we have therefore established a sepa-
rate  Board  of  Management  position  for  software,  which  
will  additionally  be  responsible  for  the  Digital  &  Software-
Services Group division. 
We are keeping a close eye on our goal to become the global 
leading provider of sustainable mobility. This will be possible 
if  we  continue  to  improve.  We  want  to  achieve  sustainable 
growth  and  create  value.  For  our  customers.  For  our  work-
force. For our shareholders. 
I thank you for your trust and invite you to stay with us as we 
move forward on this journey. 
Sincerely, 
But the transformation of the car will go far beyond drives. It 
is becoming a highly complex, connected device, like a “tablet 
on  wheels”,  if  you  like.  From  assistance  systems  through

Letter to our shareholders
Dear fellow shareholder,
In 2015 we built on the consistent, sustainable performance of previous years, 
delivering growth in a difficult and volatile trading environment. Our 2015 
performance was driven by the relevance of our Nutrition, Health and Wellness 
strategy, which represents our engine of value creation and which we continue  
to execute effectively.
We delivered organic growth of 4.2%, composed of real internal growth of 2.2% 
and pricing of 2.0%. Sales were CHF 88.8 billion, impacted by foreign exchange  
of –7.4%. The Group’s trading operating profit was CHF 13.4 billion with a margin  
of 15.1%, down 20 basis points on a reported basis affected by the strong Swiss 
Franc, up 10 basis points in constant currencies. This performance was achieved 
while we again increased substantially our investment in brand support, digital, 
research and development, and our new nutrition and health platforms. Net profit 
was CHF 9.1 billion. The reduction of CHF 5.4 billion versus last year was mostly  
due to the one-off impact from the disposal in 2014 of part of the L’Oréal stake 
combined with the revaluation of the Galderma stake. There was also some effect 
from foreign exchange. Earnings per share at CHF 2.90 were down 36.1% for the 
same reasons. Underlying earnings per share in constant currencies increased  
by 6.5%. The Group’s operating cash flow remained strong at CHF 14.3 billion and 
free cash flow was CHF 9.9 billion or 11.2% of sales. In view of this performance  
and the company’s strong financial position, the Board is proposing a dividend of   
CHF 2.25 per share up from CHF 2.20 last year. During the year we completed  
a share buyback of CHF 8 billion. It is worth noting that since 1942 your company 
has never reduced the dividend paid to its shareholders. In fact, the dividend has 
increased every year since 1995.
Based on our solid and consistent record in delivering growth at the higher end 
of the industry, we are confident we can continue to deliver on our long-term 
commitment: organic growth of 5% to 6% with improvements in margins and 
underlying earnings per share in constant currencies, and capital efficiency. There 
will be years when we exceed this ambition and years when we come close, but  
this is the profitable growth line we walk over time.
2016 marks the 150th anniversary of our company and we will celebrate 150 years 
of passion for Nutrition, Health and Wellness. Our founder Henri Nestlé’s 
determination, commitment and pioneering spirit have inspired our people around 
the world to develop and apply scientific and nutritional know-how to enhance the 
quality of life of our consumers and those they care for. This passion for nutrition

Letter to our shareholders
will continue to guide the development of our company in the future and will 
further strengthen our determination to bring Good Food, Good Life to billions of 
consumers around the world. It is with this conviction that we have made public 
commitments to further improve the nutritional profile of our products by reducing 
the amount of salt, sugar and saturated fats, and remove trans fats completely. 
Thanks to our unique global Research and Development capabilities, we are on 
track to meet these promises.
In addition, we are extending the boundaries of our business beyond our food and 
beverages portfolio to fully realise our Nutrition, Health and Wellness ambitions. In 
2011 we created Nestlé Health Science to exploit the therapeutic role of nutrition 
with an innovative pipeline of products designed to make a major contribution to the 
health of different populations. Then, in 2014 we created Nestlé Skin Health which 
is helping people meet the needs of their skin at every stage of life’s journey with 
products to protect, serve and enhance skin health. It is our size and our scale that 
allows us to invest heavily in these new areas that have the potential, over the long 
term, to offer great benefits to society.
For our business to prosper over the long term, we must deliver value to you, our 
shareholders, as well as to the communities in which we operate and to society as a 
whole. This is what we call Creating Shared Value. This is how we go about running 
and developing our business. This is how we build trust over time. Our full set of 
39 public commitments provide the framework for our engagement with society. 
We build trust by providing our consumers with products and services of the 
highest quality and safety. We build trust with every consumer contact we make  
as this is the basis of our future success, particularly as consumers and the public  
in a digital world enjoy full transparency on all aspects of the life of the company  
and are consequently more demanding. When trust is challenged, such as in India 
with Maggi or in the United States with Beneful, we act swiftly and decisively to  
deal with the issue. Maintaining the trust of consumers is a non-negotiable priority 
for our company.
In 2015 we continued our portfolio management, designed to ensure the right 
resource allocation and maximise the growth opportunities in every category. As 
part of this process we divested our Davigel frozen food business and announced 
our intention to build a strong player in the ice cream industry by setting up a joint 
venture with R&R Ice Cream, a leading European ice cream company. This and 
other developments were examined during the Board of Directors’ annual strategy 
review. The Board also examined the company’s R&D strategy and reviewed the 
4

--- Page 9 ---
major acquisitions of the last few years as well as the company’s business in China. 
Reflecting our belief in the importance of our people, the Board also considered 
our progress in diversity and gender balance. For the first time in 2015 we sought 
the approval of the Annual General Meeting for the compensation of the Board of 
Directors and the Executive Board as the new Swiss ‘say on pay’ law required. All 
the proposals were passed with large majorities. We believe the approach we have 
taken in this area is in line with both the law and with the spirit of the law. 
During the year Nandu Nandkishore, Executive Vice President in charge of Zone 
Asia, Oceania and sub-Saharan Africa, took early retirement after a long and 
distinguished career with Nestlé. The Board of Directors appointed Wan Ling 
Martello to succeed him in that role and François-Xavier Roger to succeed her as 
Chief Financial Officer. Also José Lopez, Executive Vice President in charge  
of Operations, took a well-deserved retirement after 36 years of dedicated service  
to the Group. He was succeeded by Magdi Batato who was most recently the 
Market Head of Pakistan. We would like to thank Nandu, José and all of those who 
retired during the year for their contributions and extend our best wishes for a  
long and happy retirement.
As we embark on our next 150 years of passion for nutrition, we thank you, our 
shareholders, for your continued trust in Nestlé. Thanks to your support, our 
clear strategic direction, our balanced portfolio, strong innovation pipeline and  
commitment to quality and to building trust, we continue to prosper. We would 
like to thank all our 335 000 employees whose hard work, alignment behind our 
Nutrition, Health and Wellness strategy and commitment to Nestlé enable us to 
deliver on our promises. By fulfilling the expectations of consumers in meaningful 
ways each day, they ensure that your company continues to generate the profitable 
growth that you, our shareholders, rightfully expect.

The strategy
With our Nutrition, Health 
and Wellness strategy we 
support people who want 
to live a healthier lifestyle. 
Industry-leading research and 
development drives innovation 
and supports the constant 
renovation of our food and 
beverage portfolio. In addition, 
our researchers are exploring 
the role of nutritional therapies 
to maintain or improve health 
and investigating how we can 
help people look after their 
skin. By sharing our insights 
on global Nutrition, Health 
and Wellness challenges, by 
building partnerships and by 
engaging with policymakers, 
stakeholders and key opinion 
leaders we strive to have 
a positive impact on the 
societies in which we operate. 
We empower people to make informed decisions 
when they choose what to eat. Through Start 
Healthy Stay Healthy, our interactive, science-
based education programme, we help parents 
and caregivers provide their children with the 
nutrition they need in the crucial first 1000 days 
of life. Our United for Healthier Kids programme, 
takes this further, helping parents and caregivers 
establish healthier eating, drinking and lifestyle 
habits for children as they get older, and our 
Nestlé Healthy Kids programme is helping to

In addition, we have set out six strategic 
priorities. Firstly, Make Choices: put resources 
behind the ideas, products and categories that 
help us on our journey to recognised Nutrition, 
Health and Wellness leadership, and to deliver 
sustained financial performance. Secondly, Grasp 
Opportunities: see the opportunity in change 
and trends, and translate them into concrete 
business opportunities. The third is Value What 
Consumers Value: all that we do should create 
value for consumers and drive out waste. Fourth, 
Engage with Stakeholders: we want to be trusted 
by all consumers and stakeholders as a genuine 
and responsible member of the community. Fifth, 
Embrace Digital: deepen the connection with 
consumers through the growing e-commerce 
channel and through real-time listening, 
engagement and dialogue. Sixth is Win through 
People and Teams: we need the right people with 
the right capabilities and effective leadership at all 
levels to engage, empower and enable everyone 
to give their best.
As we strive to become a more agile and 
higher-performing organisation we ensure that 
we embed our strong culture and values across 
all our operating companies, especially those 
that are newly acquired, all within the framework 
of compliance which governs all that we do. We 
take a long-term view, framed in a robust set of 
principles and values that are based on respect: 
respect for people, respect for future generations, 
respect for the environment and respect for the 
diverse world we live in.
The strategy
deliver a healthier lifestyle for children by teaching 
nutrition and encouraging physical activity.
We are on track to deliver on our commitments 
to reduce the amount of salt, sugar and saturated 
fats in our products and remove trans fats, 
while maintaining consumer preference. We are 
enhancing our portion guidance and improving 
our labelling, printing GDAs (Guideline Daily 
Amounts) on the front of packs, making it easier 
for people to read them.
In recent years we have reinforced and 
expanded our Nutrition, Health and Wellness 
strategy with the creation of Nestlé Health 
Science and Nestlé Skin Health. Nestlé Health 
Science is advancing the role of nutritional 
therapy to change the course of health for 
consumers, patients and for our partners in 
healthcare. With Nestlé Skin Health we are 
entering the field of specialised medical skin 
treatment by offering science-based solutions for 
the health of skin, hair and nails over the course  
of people’s lives.
We strive to meet the fast-changing 
expectations of our consumers because like 
them, we care deeply about quality, food safety, 
the environment and sustainability. Responsible 
behaviour wherever we operate is at the very 
heart of what we do. It is our fundamental belief 
that for a company to prosper over the long term 
we need to create value for shareholders while at 
the same time creating value for society. We call 
this Creating Shared Value. Trusted leadership 
in Nutrition, Health and Wellness is our strategic 
ambition, Creating Shared Value is how we go 
about it. The inclusion of the Nestlé in society 
report, alongside this Annual Review and the 
Financial Statements in the 2015 Annual Report 
package, reflects how Creating Shared Value 
is fully embedded into internal management 
processes and the way we do business. 
The Nestlé Strategic Roadmap (illustrated 
opposite) is the compass that guides our 
organisation, driving internal alignment behind 
our goals. The roadmap shows how we deliver 
profitable growth, the competitive advantages 
that we leverage and the organisation we have 
chosen, in order to be effective and efficient. It is 
the framework that we use to establish priorities 
and drive execution.

Letter to shareholders
“ We have absolute clarity 
on our future, and we are 
focused on accelerating 
growth, gaining share 
and increasing returns for 
shareholders over time.”
Jane Fraser  
Chief Executive Officer
Dear shareholders,
Looking back at 2022, I don’t think any of us could have predicted the 
twists and turns the year would take. Lingering disruptions to supply 
chains, historic inflationary pressures, persistent lockdowns in China 
and the largest war on European soil since World War II combined to 
create a tumultuous environment for businesses and financial markets.
As a leading global bank with a more-than-210-year history, these 
dynamics are not unfamiliar to us. And as we showed throughout the 
pandemic, Citi is an important source of strength and stability during 
times of immense change and challenge. This is an opportunity and a 
responsibility we take very seriously.
So, for me, 2022 will be remembered most for two things: 
The first is how we continued to support our clients. We helped them 
navigate macro and geopolitical dynamics. We advised them in their digital 
transformations and supported the shifts in their business models. We 
guided them in their transitions toward a clean-energy economy. When war 
broke out in Ukraine, we sprang to the aid of our employees and clients on 
the ground, and helped our multinational clients unwind their operations in 
Russia in response to Western sanctions aimed at the country. 
The second is the important strides we are making to position Citi to win 
in the decade ahead. In March 2022, at our first Investor Day in several 
years, we set a vision and refreshed our strategy to change our business 
mix and simplify our operating model. We have 
absolute clarity on our future, and we are focused 
on accelerating growth, gaining share and 
increasing returns for shareholders over time. 
By most measures, we ended the year in a stronger 
position than we started. 
A foundation for the future
Our vision for Citi is to be the preeminent banking 
partner for institutions with cross-border needs, 
a global leader in wealth management and a 
valued personal bank in our home market. 
To that end, we have laid the foundation 
by focusing on five core interconnected 
businesses: Services, Markets, Banking, 
Global Wealth Management and U.S. 
Personal Banking. We intentionally designed 
our business mix to withstand different 
macroeconomic conditions, and we have seen 
that borne out over the past year. So whilst the 
environment has changed, our strategy has 
not, and we remain steadfast in executing and 
delivering for our shareholders.
2
For the year, we delivered $14.8 billion in net income on 
revenues of $75.3 billion. Our Return on Tangible Common 
Equity (RoTCE1) was 8.9%, and we remain on track to achieve 
an RoTCE of 11–12% in the medium term. 
We increased our Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio by nearly 
80 basis points to 13%, which includes a buffer of 100 basis 
points above the regulatory requirement to help absorb the 
impact of various macro and other factors. Finally, our tangible 
book value per share1 increased to $81.65, and we returned 
more than $7 billion to our shareholders through common 
dividends and share repurchases. 
How our core businesses fared
Our Services business had an exceptional year with revenues 
up 27% versus 2021. Treasury and Trade Solutions (TTS), 
the crown jewel of our global network, experienced a 32% 
increase in revenues as we continued to grow our wallet 
share with existing clients whilst also adding new client 
relationships. With the introduction of a seven-day sweeps 
service, the industry’s first 24/7 USD clearing capabilities 
and instant payments in 33 markets, we’re moving closer 
to an always-on, near real-time cash management solution 
for corporate clients. In Securities Services, we grew yearly 
revenues by 15% and onboarded $1.2 trillion in assets under 
custody and administration. 
Our Markets business closed 2022 with revenues up 7% 
from 2021, ending the year with one of the best fourth 
quarters in recent memory. Our traders navigated the 
volatility quite well, with notable performance amongst 
corporate clients and strong gains in FX and rates. And 
together with our Corporate Bank, our Markets team 
continued to optimize its balance sheet. 
Revenues in Banking fell 35% as we contended with a materially 
slower deal environment. But Banking remains a key part of 
our strategy, and we continued to play a leading role in the 
year’s notable transactions. This included acting as one of the 
lead advisors on Volkswagen’s €9.4 billion IPO of Porsche, the 
largest public listing of the year, and serving as financial advisor 
to Amgen on its proposed $27.8 billion acquisition of Horizon 
Therapeutics. We hired exceptional bankers in healthcare, clean 
energy and technology — all sectors critical to our growth — 
and welcomed new talent into our Commercial Bank as it has 
expanded into Canada, Germany and Switzerland.
In U.S. Personal Banking, revenues for the year rose 7% as we 
bolstered our leadership in payments and lending. Branded 
Cards grew revenues by 9%, whilst Retail Services revenues 
were up 7%. We launched new credit cards with ExxonMobil 
and AT&T and celebrated 35 years of our co-branded credit

card partnership with American Airlines. Revenues in Retail 
Banking were roughly flat for the full year, but we continued to 
enhance our digital capabilities, growing digital users by 6% 
for the year. And as part of our efforts to break down barriers to 
banking, last year we became the first of the largest U.S. banks 
to completely eliminate overdraft fees and returned item fees 
for our customers.
We also made progress building out our Global Wealth 
Management business despite the economic headwinds 
that slowed activity amongst our Asia-based clients in 
particular and reduced overall revenues by 2%. Having unified 
our Wealth businesses under a single platform, we’ve been 
acquiring new clients and investing in hiring advisors to make 
sure we’re well-positioned for success as the markets recover. 
In addition, we forged ahead with our global expansion, 
opening Private Bank offices in Paris and Frankfurt, a new 
Wealth center in Hong Kong and a Citi Global Wealth at Work 
presence in Luxembourg. 
Greater connectivity and focus
A centerpiece of our go-forward plan is increasing the linkages 
between our businesses so we can more easily engage clients 
in one part of our firm with products and services from another. 
By delivering the full power of Citi to clients, we can deepen 
existing relationships and win new mandates. 
Our Markets and Banking businesses are now aligned more 
closely than ever, and, as a result, we are supporting our 
clients in a more integrated way. Our Wealth business is also 
benefiting from closer connections and received more than 
60,000 referrals from the Retail Bank last year. In addition, 
we have established a new partnership agreement between 
Wealth and our Commercial Bank, where 90% of our clients 
are privately owned companies. 
At the same time, we are making progress in simplifying our 
firm, making us easier to manage and allowing us to focus on 
the parts of our business where we know we can grow and 
improve our competitiveness. 
We announced our intention to exit 14 consumer businesses 
in Asia, Europe, the Middle East and Mexico — businesses 
that do not have clear synergies with our global network. 
As a result of swift but disciplined execution, in 2022 we 
successfully closed the sale of our consumer businesses in 
Australia, Bahrain, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand. 
In March 2023, we closed the sale of our consumer 
businesses in India and Vietnam and are on track to close 
two additional markets by the end of the year. We also 
are progressing with the wind-down of our consumer 
business in Korea. In addition to exiting our consumer and 
local commercial banking businesses in Russia, we are 
actively ending nearly all institutional banking services in 
the country, and by the second quarter of 2023, our only 
operations will be those necessary to fulfill any legal and 
regulatory obligations. Apart from Russia, Citi will continue 
to serve our clients and invest in these markets through our 
institutional franchise and our Wealth business. 
6
Citi’s Transformation
For our strategy to unlock the greatest possible value, 
we know we need to modernize our infrastructure so that 
we are scaled and agile and able to continue to deliver 
for our clients. The consent orders issued in 2020 by the 
Federal Reserve Board and Office of the Comptroller of 
the Currency underscored how we had underinvested not 
only in parts of our infrastructure but also in our risk and 
controls environment and our data governance.
Last year, we made progress in accelerating our work to address 
these gaps and simplify and modernize our operating model for 
the digital age. This work is so consequential in nature that we 
call it our “Transformation.” It remains my number one priority.
Whilst this is a multi-year journey, we are already seeing the 
fruits of our labors. We have dramatically streamlined our 
approval process for new products. And new stress testing 
capabilities enable us to make faster, better-informed risk 
decisions. This made a huge difference in how we have been 
able to minimize the impact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine 
on all parts of our business. 
Investments in our people and communities 
Ensuring we have a culture characterized by excellence and 
accountability underpins the success of our Transformation 
and broader vision for the firm. Last year, we launched a 
program, Citi’s New Way, to help our colleagues adopt the 
everyday habits we need in order to operate with excellence. 
We have also hardwired accountability into our firm by 
strengthening our performance management process and 
implementing a greater emphasis on financial returns rather 
than on revenues. 
The diversity of the nearly 240,000 people who work at Citi 
is a distinguishing aspect of our firm, as is the diversity of our 
Board, which is majority female. We remain committed to a 
workplace that mirrors the communities we serve. In 2022, 
we set new goals to increase the number of women and other 
underrepresented groups working at Citi. These new goals 
follow our success in exceeding the three-year goals we set in 
2018 to increase the percentage of women in the firm globally 
and of Black talent in the U.S. 
In another sign of our progress, last year we celebrated the 
promotion of one of the largest and most diverse Managing 
Director classes in recent years. Maintaining a workplace 
that is diverse, equitable and inclusive is not only true to our 
values but key to our competitiveness.
Our commitment to advancing diversity, equity and inclusion 
goes well beyond Citi’s walls as we continue to use our 
resources as a global bank to take on some of society’s 
toughest challenges. We expanded the Citi Impact Fund 
to $500 million in support of diverse founders who are 
driving both financial and social returns. And we delivered 
on our commitment to transparency and accountability by 
announcing the findings from an external review and audit of 
our $1 billion Action for Racial Equity initiative to help close 
the racial wealth gap.

We have also been a leader in reimagining the future of 
work. Drawing on lessons learned during the pandemic, we 
have institutionalized a hybrid work model for much of our 
firm. This approach provides the flexibility that our people 
want whilst also ensuring we benefit from the in-person 
collaboration, real-time coaching and apprenticeship that 
occurs only when we are physically together. 
Everywhere you look around the firm, there is an undeniable 
sense of momentum. We have never been clearer about the 
bank we want to be, and we have made significant progress 
over the past year in bringing this vision to life. Through our 
relentless commitment to excellence, we are changing the 
trajectory of Citi to close the gap with our competitors and 
deliver a new era of success for all our stakeholders.

Jane Fraser

To Our Shareholders
Throughout our annual report this year, you’ll read 
about how Johnson & Johnson is bringing meaningful 
innovation to our patients and customers, and making 
a difference in their lives in a personal way—from 
Brunhilde Wecker, who made a full recovery from her stroke 
thanks to our new blood clot retrieval and removal device,  
to our own Bill Hait, an oncologist whose vision and insights 
helped accelerate the approval of a wholly new treatment for 
prostate cancer.  
  These stories remind us why health care is such a rewarding 
endeavor. They excite me about the future of Johnson & Johnson.
  Over the past few years, we have navigated steadily through a 
series of significant challenges, keeping a long-term perspective, 
maintaining a disciplined approach to 
managing our investments for growth and 
our portfolio of broadly based businesses, 
and staying true to our operating model and 
values. We have turned the corner on a 
particularly difficult period. 
In 2011, the year Johnson & Johnson 
celebrated its 125th anniversary, we 
returned to sales growth, launched a 
number of innovative new products to 
address unmet health care needs across the 
globe, and advanced our pipelines, which 
today are among the best in the industry.
  We strengthened our product portfolios 
and leadership positions in many areas, 
including immunology, oncology, surgical 
devices and emerging markets. And we 
focused on scientific innovation to maintain 
or build share in other key growth markets.
  We are delivering meaningful innovations in health care and 
building a more agile company to seize market opportunities.  
All the while, we’ve remained committed to Our Credo and the 
long-held values that have enabled us to succeed now for decades.
  Though we continue to face difficult and uncertain 
macroeconomic conditions, our ongoing investments have us 
well positioned to grow and increase our market leadership in 
one of the most important and rewarding industries in the world 
while delivering sustainable growth for our shareholders.
Our Five-Year JOu rneY
Several years ago, we set out to build on our strong foundation 
and sustain our track record of growth, even as we prepared to 
address a daunting challenge: the patent expirations for two of 
our major drugs, RISPERDAL® (risperidone) and TOPAMAX® 
(topiramate). Together, these products had combined peak-year 
sales of more than $6 billion. We also prepared ourselves for 
other market issues to which we had a good line of sight.
  Additional developments could not be as easily foreseen:  
the severe economic decline; the tightening of consumer 
spending and health care budgets; over-the-counter (OTC) 
product quality issues at McNeil Consumer Healthcare and  
the recall of the DePuy ASR™ Hip System.
  Our company was severely tested. 
In managing through this stretch, we relied heavily on the resolve 
of our people and on our time-tested business model: our broad 
base in health care, our decentralized management structure, 
managing for the long term and the values set forth in Our Credo. 
  We made necessary restructurings to our business to manage 
our cost structure, simplify our operations, and ensure the most 
efficient use of our capital for the long-term benefit of patients 
and shareholders.
       Our management team and employees 
took critical actions to preserve the core 
values and strengths of our business.  
We remained committed to retaining the 
trust of our patients and customers, taking 
responsibility and instituting new measures 
to ensure that our products live up to the 
high quality standards that our customers 
expect and deserve.
       As 2011 came to a close, we moved through 
a turning point. The headwinds from patent 
expirations, tough portfolio choices, litigation 
matters and OTC product quality issues had 
been, or were being, addressed. 
       At the same time, our continued 
investments in research and development 
(R&D), equaling nearly $37 billion over the 
past five years, yielded nine major approvals 
for new pharmaceutical products in the 
United States—including STELARA® (ustekinumab) and SIMPONI® 
(golimumab) in immunology; PREZISTA® (darunavir) and 
INTELENCE® (etravirine) in HIV; ZYTIGA® (abiraterone acetate) in 
oncology; and XARELTO® (rivaroxaban) in cardiovascular disease. 
  The emphasis we place on R&D has also led to exciting 
innovations in our Medical Devices and Diagnostics (MD&D) and 
Consumer platforms, such as contact lenses, electrophysiology, 
advanced energy, biosurgicals, oral care and skin care.
  We have replenished or advanced our pipelines with new 
technologies, like the Fibrin Pad for hemostasis, as well as 
compounds like canagliflozin for diabetes and bapineuzumab for 
Alzheimer’s disease.
  With our focus on financial discipline, capital has been  
returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and share 
repurchases. Capital has also been used for important long-term 
investments in strategic alliances and acquisitions like Pfizer 
Consumer Healthcare and Beijing Dabao Cosmetics Company, Ltd. 
in the Consumer business; Crucell N.V. and Elan Corporation plc  
in our Pharmaceuticals business; and the pending acquisition

of Synthes, Inc. in the MD&D business.
  When I look back at how we faced this period of industry and 
global change, and how we have managed, I am proud of the 
people of Johnson & Johnson. They have shown the ingenuity, 
resiliency, tenacity, integrity and compassion that you would 
expect of a global leader in human health care.
2011 results
Johnson & Johnson returned to delivering operational sales growth 
in 2011. We grew adjusted earnings1 for the 28th consecutive year. 
Our worldwide sales were $65.0 billion, an increase of 5.6 percent. 
Sales increased operationally 2.8 percent, reflecting the strength of 
new product launches in our Pharmaceuticals business segment, 
steady performance across our MD&D franchise, science-based 
innovations in our Consumer business and strong growth in 
emerging markets. 
  Approximately 70 percent of our sales were from products with 
No. 1 or No. 2 global market share positions. Approximately 
25 percent of our sales were from products introduced in the past 
five years.
  With our continued focus on financial discipline, our adjusted 
earnings were $13.9 billion1 and adjusted earnings per share were 
$5.001, representing increases of 4.4 percent and 5.0 percent, 
respectively.
  We invested $7.5 billion in R&D and advanced robust pipelines 
across all three of our business segments. 
  We generated significant free cash flow of approximately 
$11.4 billion2, maintained our AAA credit rating and increased the 
dividend to our shareholders for the 49th consecutive year.
  Solid and consistent returns to shareholders have been a 
hallmark of Johnson & Johnson. During 2011, we generated a  
one-year total shareholder return of nearly 10 percent, exceeding 
the Standard & Poor’s 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average. Over 
longer timeframes, we continue to compare favorably to those 
indices. With a long-term management focus, our company has 
remained a solid investment choice for decades. (For more details, 
see the 2011 Business Segment Highlights on pages 4 and 5.)
FOr Ces shaping health  Ca re
As we look ahead, we see three major forces shaping the health 
care environment: macroeconomic conditions, the role of 
government payers and regulators, and industry trends. Clearly, 
each poses continuing challenges. But inherent in each are also 
opportunities … and we are seizing them. 
•  Macroeconomic conditions: Slowing economic growth, the 
uncertainty in financial markets, high unemployment and 
pressure on health care costs have all contributed to 
constraints on health care spending. 
These dynamics are balanced by demographic trends that 
are creating demand for health care. Populations in the 
developed world are aging rapidly, and we consume more 
health care as we grow older. Global expansion and growth, 
though slower than a few years ago, also lead to growing 
demand for health care, especially in emerging markets. 
  Our investments continue to be aligned with these market 
opportunities to address unmet medical needs. Cancers, 
mental health disorders, diabetes, heart disease, stroke, 
rheumatoid arthritis and HIV are all among the most 
significant diseases—and they are markets where today we 
either have leadership or are increasing investments to gain 
leadership.
•  Government payers and regulators: As health care reform 
evolves around the world, governments are requiring more 
cost-effective health care solutions. 
  We recognize these priorities and are making investments 
in personalized medicine and companion diagnostics, 
especially in the areas of oncology and anti-psychotics, that 
are geared toward how we can better target treatments, 
monitor results and be more efficient in product development.
As the regulatory environment has become much more 
intense, we share a common goal with regulators: saving lives, 
easing people’s suffering and addressing unmet medical needs 
with meaningful innovations. We support strong regulatory 
environments that ensure patient safety while enabling the 
fast and efficient approval of potentially life-saving medicines 
and treatments.
•  Industry trends: Bringing new innovations to market 
requires significant investments, access to the best minds  
and talent, and adaptability to ever-changing markets. 
It is more important than ever for companies to be agile, 
collaborative and able to thrive with new business models.  
We have always looked to complement our development 
efforts with acquisitions and collaborations that help us  
gain new capabilities or provide access to technology, 
products and compounds that we can accelerate to market. 
The collaborations in Alzheimer’s disease with Elan and Pfizer, 
and in HIV with Gilead Sciences, Inc., are just a few of our 
promising ventures. 
Well pO s it iOned F Or gr OWth
Overall, Johnson & Johnson is well positioned to address these 
evolving market forces and opportunities: 
•  Because of the ways we are delivering meaningful innovations 
to patients and customers; 
•  Because of the steps we have taken to build a more agile company; 
•  And because of our commitment to the operating model and

values that have enabled such a consistent track record of 
success.
aChieving meaningFul innO vatiOn
We have learned there are many paths to achieving meaningful 
innovation. For us, the first step is to identify the significant unmet 
need and market opportunity where we believe Johnson & Johnson 
can make a difference for patients.
  We first look for areas where we have capabilities, insights and 
unique advantages that can shape the opportunity. Then we 
search both inside and outside our companies to find the latest 
science and research to address these needs. In addition to our 
own R&D, we use strategic alliances, licensing arrangements, 
acquisitions and venture capital investments to give us insight 
into and access to the next big breakthrough. Finally, we leverage 
the breadth of our resources in development, supply chain, 
marketing and sales to bring these innovative products to market.
  Our Pharmaceuticals business has followed this model with its 
pursuit of better treatments for hepatitis C and cardiovascular 
disease. For hepatitis C, which infects about 170 million people 
worldwide, we partnered with Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. on the 
development of telaprevir. It was approved in 2011 and is now 
being marketed as INCIVO® in Europe. 
  Also in 2011, we partnered with Bayer Healthcare on the 
development and launch of XARELTO®, for prevention of deep 
vein thrombosis in knee or hip replacement surgery and for 
reducing the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients 
with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation.
   Other times, we may choose an acquisition to broaden our 
portfolio with a new capability or to gain entry into a new piece of 
the market with a technology we don’t have in our own pipeline.  
That was the case with the REVIVE™ SE Device, the innovative 
product that helped save Mrs. Wecker’s life, which came to us 
through the acquisition of Micrus Endovascular LLC in 2010. It is 
now an important new option in the treatment of ischemic stroke. 
In the case of the Fibrin Pad, we started out as strategic partners 
with Israel-based Omrix Pharmaceuticals Ltd., working to solve 
unmet medical needs in surgical bleeding. As the collaboration 
developed, we determined that an acquisition would allow us to 
better manage the complex development and intricate regulatory 
filings necessary to achieve success for this convergent product, 
which is anxiously awaited by surgeons.
  Another approach is to use our broad base of businesses and 
expertise to tackle a disease state on multiple fronts. Diabetes is 
one example. We can offer devices like blood glucose monitors 
and insulin pumps; develop new drugs, as we are with 
canagliflozin; and help patients and consumers achieve healthier 
living through our Consumer Wellness & Prevention business  
and nutritional products such as SPLENDA® Sweeteners.
Operating With a gi li tY On  a  Ba se OF s trOng v alue s
Just as important as the way we innovate is the way we operate. 
We have focused on improving our operations to reflect our 
commitment to delivering high-quality products and to adapt to 
the rapidly evolving marketplace. 
  Beyond meaningful innovations and agility, the foundation of 
our decades of sustained growth remains an unwavering 
commitment to our operating model and values.
  The tenets of Our Credo provide a clear focus for how we 
approach each decision: patients and customers first, then our 
employees, our communities, and our shareholders.
  The last few years have offered significant challenges, but our 
commitment to Our Credo has remained the foundation of our 
response. It provides a common set of values that hold together 
our approximately 118,000 employees in 60 countries and more 
than 250 operating companies. 
  Our responsibility as a global citizen is rooted in Our Credo. 
For more than 125 years our innovations and philanthropy have 
touched the lives of billions of people, particularly in areas of the 
world where access to basic health care is a challenge. 
In 2011, we were honored to be recognized by the United 
Nations as Humanitarian of the Year for our work in this regard. 
We reported strong progress in the inaugural year of our five-year 
pledge to help save and improve the lives of 120 million women 
and children annually in developing countries as part of the 
United Nations Millennium Development Goals. 
  We are proud of this and the many other programs driven by the 
passion of our employees and hundreds of equally passionate 
partners around the world. 
O ur COmmitmen t tO Y Ou

2011 Business Segment 
Highlights
A fter two challenging years,  
Johnson & Johnson returned  
to delivering operational sales 
growth in 2011. We continued to 
strengthen our platform for leadership 
and profitable growth through new 
product launches, strong pipelines and 
investments in key growth areas.
Johnson & Johnson has three distinct business segments  
that share a common focus on human health. 
pharmaCeutiC als
With $24.4 billion in sales in 2011, we are the eighth  largest 
pharmaceuticals business in the world and the sixth largest 
biotech business. Strong operational growth of 6.2 percent 
was driven by recently launched products like STELARA® 
(ustekinumab), SIMPONI® (golimumab), ZYTIGA® (abiraterone 
acetate), INCIVO® (telaprevir) and INVEGA® SUSTENNA® 
(paliperidone palmitate).
  Through 2011, we built on the continued success of recently 
launched products to strengthen our leadership position 
in core therapeutic areas including immunology, infectious 
disease, neuroscience and oncology. For products launched 
between 2009 and 2011, Johnson & Johnson led the United 
States in new pharmaceutical products this past year.
  We expanded our immunology leadership and sales with the 
amendment to our global distribution agreement with Merck & Co. 
on our largest-selling product, REMICADE® (infliximab), and 
SIMPONI® (golimumab). 
  We also received approval of INCIVO® in Europe for  
hepatitis C, which is marketed as INCIVEK™ by our strategic 
partner, Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc., in the U.S.
  We completed the acquisition of Crucell N.V., building a 
key leadership position in vaccines. And we entered into new 
collaborations with companies like Pharmacyclics, Inc., with 
which we will jointly develop and market an anti-cancer 
compound, building our strength in oncology.
In terms of pipeline progress in 2011, we were the U.S. 
leader in new molecular entity approvals with three: ZYTIGA® 
in oncology,  XARELTO® (rivaroxaban) in cardiovascular 
disease and EDURANT® (rilpivirine) in HIV. This progress 
in the Pharmaceuticals business segment is the result of our 
commitment to continued investment in product launches  
and pipeline compounds.
mediC al de viCes and diagnO stiCs
With $25.8 billion in sales in 2011, our Medical Devices and 
Diagnostics (MD&D) business unit is the largest medical device 
business in the world. Operational sales growth was just under 
2 percent.
  The year saw many challenges in several MD&D markets, as 
well as issues with the DePuy ASR™ Hip System recall. European 
austerity measures, pricing pressures and a slowdown in elective 
surgeries driven by continued economic pressures have all 
contributed to more tempered growth rates. Despite these 
challenges, our MD&D business segment is competing well in  
a global market that has undergone dynamic change. 
In 2011, MD&D showed strong double-digit growth  
in the BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India and China) markets  
where we have introduced many innovative products. 
Meanwhile, in Asia-Pacific and Europe, we have been rolling  
out 1-DAY ACUVUE® MOIST® Brand Contact Lenses for 
ASTIGMATISM. 
  We continued to advance important products through  
the regulatory process. In 2011, 75 percent of the MD&D 
pipeline advanced to the next major milestone. Breakthrough 
products like the SEDASYS® System, the first computer-assisted 
personalized sedation system, and the Fibrin Pad, in the area  
of surgical bleeding, are progressing with the U.S. Food and  
Drug Administration. We also are increasing investments 
in emerging markets, with new innovation centers in India 
and China, while continuing to support a number of training 
institutes around the world.

  With these actions and others, our 
MD&D business unit has been able to 
sustain the No. 1 or No. 2 leadership 
positions in 80 percent of our key 
platforms while growing or maintaining 
share in the majority of these platforms.
  We’ve also made some strategic 
portfolio decisions in this business 
segment, such as refocusing our 
cardiovascular business. In 2011, 
we exited the drug-eluting stent 
business and shifted investments to 
higher-growth, higher-need areas like 
electrophysiology. These decisions 
will help to fund growth potential in 
other promising areas. Decisions to 
acquire Synthes, Inc. and strengthen 
our leadership position in orthopaedics, 
as well as our acquisition of SterilMed, 
Inc. for its experience in re-processing 
surgical instruments, are examples of 
how we are continuously looking across 
our business for the best long-term 
growth opportunities.
COnsumer
With $14.9 billion in sales in 2011, 
our Consumer business segment is 
the sixth largest consumer health care 
company in the world. Operational sales 
declined just under 1 percent, reflecting 
the impact of remediation and supply 
issues associated with our U.S. over-the-
counter (OTC) business. The decline was 
partially offset by solid growth in certain 
franchises including Skin Care and Oral 
Care, with strong performances from 
NEUTROGENA® and the LISTERINE® 
Mouthwash brands. 
  Our Consumer group continued 
expanding into emerging markets 
with the acquisition of a line of OTC 
cough-and-cold brands in Russia from 
J.B. Chemicals & Pharmaceuticals 
Limited. We also continued to innovate, 
introducing NEUTROGENA® Naturals, 
AVEENO® SMART ESSENTIALS™, 
NICORETTE® QUICKMIST™ and 
LISTERINE® ZERO™.
  The recovery and remediation of  
the McNeil Consumer Healthcare 
business continues. The major 
commitments to date under the Consent 
Decree with the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration have been achieved, and 
several products have already returned 
to market. Volume will continue to ramp 
up, and products will be reintroduced 
throughout 2012.

Accelerating	Cancer	R&D
For	Bill	Hait,	the	most	compelling	science	is	that	
which	holds	the	greatest	promise	for	developing	
medicines	that	address	high	unmet	needs.		
“A	network	that	allows	you	to	have	insights	into	
what	is	going	on	in	the	world	of	science	is	essential,”		
says	Hait,	M.D.,	Ph.D.,	Global	Head,	Janssen	Research	&	
Development,	LLC.	“It	takes	an	understanding	of	both		
the	medical	need	and	the	most	compelling	science	to		
get	meaningful	innovations	to	patients	quickly.”	
	 One	example	is ZYTIGA®	(abiraterone	
acetate),	an	oral,	once-daily	medication	
for	use	in	combination	with	prednisone	
for	the	treatment	of	men	with	metastatic	
castration-resistant	prostate	cancer	
(CRPC)	who	have	received	prior	
chemotherapy	containing	docetaxel.	
The	U.S.	Food	and	Drug	Administration	
granted	marketing	approval	for	ZYTIGA®	
in	April	2011	after	an	expedited	
six-month	review.	An	accelerated	
regulatory	review	process	granted	by	
the	European	Medicines	Agency	led	to	
marketing	authorization	by	the	European	
Commission	in	September	2011.
	 How	this	transformative	prostate	
cancer	treatment	came	to	market	
exemplifies	a	fundamental	shift	in	the	
approach	to	research	and	development	
that	is	being	applied	across	Janssen	
Research	&	Development.
surgical	reduction	of	hormones,	some	
cancers	continue	to	rely	on	them.	Before	
the	approval	of	ZYTIGA®,	treatment	
options	to	extend	life	for	men	with	
this	kind	of	metastatic	castration-
resistant	prostate	cancer	were	limited	to	
chemotherapy.	When	this	was	no	longer	
effective,	patients	were	out	of	treatment	
options.
	 Abiraterone	acetate	was	discovered	
by	Imperial	Cancer	Research	at	Royal	
Marsden	Hospital	in	London.	It	was	
licensed	to	Cougar	Biotechnology,	Inc.,	
which	began	testing	the	compound	in	men	
with	CRPC	who	were	taking	androgen	
deprivation	therapy.
“This	breakthrough	research	hinged	
on	scientific	understanding	of	the	tumor	
micro-environment—specifically,	the	idea	
that	the	tumor	itself	could	be	the	source	
of	the	remaining	testosterone,”	says	
compound	leader	for	abiraterone	acetate	
Michael	L.	Meyers,	M.D.,	Ph.D.,	Janssen	
Research	&	Development,	LLC.
Transforming ProsTaTe  Ca nCer 
TreaTmenT
Globally,	prostate	cancer	is	the	second	
most	frequently	diagnosed	cancer	in	men	
and	the	fifth	most	common	cancer	overall.			
According	to	estimates	by	the	National	
Cancer	Institute,	more	than	240,000	new	
cases	of	prostate	cancer	were	diagnosed	in	
the	U.S.	in	2011,	while	nearly	34,000	men	
died	from	the	disease.
	 Androgen	hormones,	such	as	
testosterone,	are	known	to	fuel	prostate	
cancer	tumors,	and	despite	chemical	or	
“By	identifying	the	key	science	for	
these	patients	and	the	fact	that	this	drug	
was	already	being	developed,	the	way	
to	accelerate	the	process	was	to	try	to	
collaborate	or	acquire	the	drug,”	says	Hait,	
who	recognized	the	value	of	abiraterone	
acetate	and	championed	the	acquisition	
of	Cougar	Biotechnology.	“The	fact	that	
it	worked	so	well	shortened	the	timeline	
between	the	start	of	the	Phase	III	trial	and	
registration	of	the	drug.”
Johnson	&	Johnson	acquired	Cougar	
Biotechnology	in	July	2009.	Based	on	
positive	results	from	a	completed	Phase	III	
study,	marketing	applications	were	filed	
with	regulatory	authorities	in	the	U.S.,	
Europe	and	other	countries	in	2010.	The	
entire	development	program	proceeded	
very	rapidly:	It	was	less	than	six	years	from	
the	time	the	first	patient	was	treated	to	
marketing	approvals	in	the	U.S.,	Canada,	
the	European	Union	and	Switzerland.
a new aP Proa Ch T o  CanCer r&D
A	noted	oncologist	before	joining	
Johnson	&	Johnson	in	March	2007,	Hait	
has	been	a	catalyst	for	change,	bringing	
focus	and	helping	to	centralize	R&D	within	
therapeutic	areas.	Within	oncology,	Hait	
created	Tumor	Strategy	Groups	(TSG)	
focused	on	three	areas	of	high	unmet	
need:	hematological	malignancies,	lung	
cancer	and	prostate	cancer.	TSGs	further	
specialize	by	using	the	tumor	micro-
environment	as	the	strategic	research	focus.
“The	tumor	is	no	longer	viewed	as	a	
tumor	cell	living	in	isolation.	A	tumor	cell	
is	very	close	to	its	environment,	and	it’s	
using	its	environment	to	grow	better,”		
says	Hait.
	 That	kind	of	insight	enabled	the	
paradigm-changing	scientific	progress	
that	led	to	ZYTIGA®,	validating	the	TSG	
approach.
Importantly,	Hait	also	helped	open	
minds	to	look	beyond	the	company’s	own	
labs	and	invest	in	science,	wherever	that	
science	may	be.	
“Drug	development	is	very	competitive	
and	difficult,”	says	Hait.	“One	way	to	be	at	
the	cutting	edge	is	not	to	be	walled	inside	
your	own	brick	and	mortar.	You	have	to	
be	out	there	to	see	the	most	exciting	new	
things	that	are	developing.”
	 Collaborations	are	one	way	of	being	out	
there,	and	they	promise	to	fuel	advances	
in	oncology	research	and	development.	
For	example,	an	ongoing	agreement	with	
the	David	H.	Koch	Institute	for	Integrative

sig hT s seT o n s CienCe  Bill	Hait	has	a	vision	for	future	research	and	development.		
The	focus	is	on	finding	and	mining	the	most	compelling	science	to	bring	products	to	market	faster.
Cancer	Research	at	the	Massachusetts	
Institute	of	Technology	fosters	oncology	
research	and	technology	development	
in	the	areas	of	cancer	diagnostics,	cancer	
biology	pre-malignancies,	genetic	models	
of	disease	and	profiles	of	the	tumor	micro-
environment.
	 Another	important	collaboration,	
announced	in	January	2011,	is	with	
Massachusetts	General	Hospital	to	develop	
and	commercialize	a	next-generation	
circulating	tumor	cell	(CTC)	technology	for	
capturing,	counting	and	characterizing	
tumor	cells	found	in	patients’	blood.	It	will	
enable	CTCs	to	be	used	both	by	oncologists,	
as	a	diagnostic	tool	for	personalizing	
patient	care,	and	by	researchers,	to	
accelerate	and	improve	the	process	of		
drug	discovery	and	development.
	 Hait	says	the	key	to	meaningful	
collaborations	is	to	have	the	right	people	
internally.	“Like-minded	people	seek	each	
other	out,”	says	Hait.	“At	the	end	of	the	day	
it’s	the	terms	of	the	contract,	but	to	get	to

Curing  
Hepatitis C
INCIVO®	(telaprevir)*,	a	new	
direct-acting	antiviral	protease	
inhibitor	for	the	treatment	of	
genotype	1**	chronic	hepatitis	C	
virus	(HCV)	in	combination	
with	pegylated	interferon	and	
ribavirin,	was	approved	in	
European	Member	States	in	
September	2011.	“The	arrival	
of	direct-acting	antivirals	will	
offer	more	patients	hope	for	
a	cure,”	says	Charles	Gore,	
President,	World	Hepatitis	
Alliance.
	 According	to	the	World	
Health	Organization,	about	
170	million	people	worldwide	
are	infected	with	hepatitis	C.	
Because	it	can	have	serious	
long-term	health	consequences
—such	as	cirrhosis,	liver	
cancer	and	liver	transplanta-
tion—hepatitis	C	carries	a	high	
economic	burden	for	patients	
and	society.
	 Named	one	of	the	top	10	
medical	innovations	of	2011	by	
the	Cleveland	Clinic,	telaprevir	
doubles	the	chances	of	clearing	
the	virus	in	half	the	treatment	
time	compared	with	prior	
standard	treatments	in	the	
majority	of	HCV	genotype	1	
patients.	
Jim	Witek,	Global	Medical	
Affairs	Leader	for	INCIVO®,	
says	this	product	is	a	new	
highlight	of	the	Janssen	
Pharmaceutical	Companies’	
expanding	infectious	disease	
portfolio.	“Our	R&D	in	serious	
infections	such	as	HIV/AIDS,	
HCV	and	tuberculosis	has	
allowed	us	to	bring	innovative	
therapies	that	are	helping	to		
redefine	and	improve	treat-
ment	outcomes,”	he	says.	
*	INCIVO®	(telaprevir)	was	co-developed	
by	Vertex	Pharmaceuticals	and	Tibotec,	
an	affiliate	of	Janssen	Pharmaceutical	
Companies	of	Johnson	&	Johnson.		
The	Janssen	Companies	have	the	right	to	
commercialize	telaprevir	in	Europe,	Latin	
America,	the	Middle	East,	Africa,	India,	
Australia	and	New	Zealand	under	the	
commercial	name	INCIVO®.

Moving From Treatment
to Prevention
Vaccines	are	fundamentally	
different	from	pharmaceutical	
medicines.	
“A	vaccine	prepares		
the	body	for	whenever	a	virus	
attacks	you,”	explains	Jaap	
Goudsmit,	Chief	Scientific	
Officer,	Crucell	N.V.	“You	
vaccinate	healthy	people,	
whereas	drugs	are	used	to	treat	
sick	people.	The	aim	of	
vaccination	is	to	prevent	
disease.”
It	takes	more	than	scientific	
expertise.	As	our	Pharmaceu-
ticals	business	grows	beyond	
a	treatment	model	to	one	
that	includes	prevention	with	
vaccines,	an	equally	important	
consideration	is	the	ability	to	
make	hundreds	of	millions	
of	doses	of	vaccine	at	a	price	
that’s	affordable	for	the		
majority	of	the	globe.
	 That’s	what	Crucell,	
acquired	by	an	affiliate	of	
Johnson	&	Johnson	in		
February	2011,	is	working		
to	do	with	a	new,	ultramodern	
manufacturing	facility	in	
Incheon,	South	Korea.		
One	of	the	largest	such	
facilities	in	the	world,	it	is	
capable	of	making	more	than	
100	million	doses	per	year		
of	pentavalent	vaccine,		
a	combination	of	five	vaccines	
in	one:	diphtheria,	tetanus,	
whooping	cough,	hepatitis	B	
and	haemophilus	influenza	
type	b	(the	bacteria	that		
causes	meningitis,	pneumonia

Addressing the Burden of HIV
In	March	2011,	several	non-	
exclusive	licenses	were	granted	
to	generic	manufacturers	in	
South	Africa	and	India	to	
manufacture,	market	and	
distribute	rilpivirine,	an	
investigational	anti-HIV	
medication	subsequently	
granted	approval	by	the	U.S.	
Food	and	Drug	Administration	
(FDA)	and	the	European	
Medicines	Agency.
“Johnson	&	Johnson	has		
expanded	the	scope	of	its	
Global	Access	Program	and	
licensed	generic	partners	to	
speed	access	to	rilpivirine,	
an	important	new	medicine	
to	treat	HIV,”	says	Alan	
Staple,	Manager	of	Strategic	
Relationships,	the	Clinton	
Health	Access	Initiative.
	 Agreements	now	exist	with	
five	generic	manufacturers	to	
ensure	widespread	access	to	
and	supply	of	rilpivirine,	both	
as	a	single-agent	medicine	and	
as	a	fixed-dose	combination	
with	multiple	medicines	in	one	
tablet	that	will	simplify	HIV	
therapy.	Four	of	these	agree-
ments	were	signed	prior	to	
receiving	regulatory	approvals	
for	rilpivirine,	allowing	generic	
manufacturers	to	make	generic	
rilpivirine	and	the	combination	
pill	available	more	quickly.	
Collaboration	with	generic	
companies	extends	beyond	
licensing	to	sharing	technical	
skills	and	providing	help	to		
ensure	safety	and	quality	as	well.
In	May	2011,	the	FDA	
granted	approval	of	EDURANT®	
(rilpivirine)	for	treatment-
naïve	adults	(those	who	have	
never	taken	HIV	therapy).	It	is	
the	third	anti-HIV	medication	
commercialized	by	Janssen	
Therapeutics,	Division	of		
Janssen	Products,	LP;	together	
with	PREZISTA®	(darunavir)	
and	INTELENCE®	(etravirine),	
the	company	can	provide		
treatment	options	for	patients	
at	all	stages	of	the	disease.	
	 Since	2007,	licensing	agree-
ments	have	been	used	with	
generic	manufacturers	to	make	
these	HIV	medicines	available	
at	a	low	special	access	price	to	
65	countries	that	have	a	high	
HIV	burden,	including	India	
and	nations	in	sub-Saharan	
Africa.	More	recently	the	agree-
ments	have	been	modified	to	
provide	access	to	rilpivirine		
in	112	low-resource	countries,	
including	Vietnam	and		
Thailand,	covering	more	than	
80	percent	of	people	living		
with	HIV	worldwide.

Immunology 
Leadership
In	2011,	global	approvals	and	
an	amended	distribution	
agreement	with	Merck	&	Co.,	
Inc.	helped	Janssen	
Pharmaceuticals,	Inc.	expand	
its	leadership	and	geographic	
presence	in	immunology,	
serving	more	patients.		
  STELARA®	(ustekinumab),		
a	treatment	for	moderate	to	
severe	plaque	psoriasis	now	
approved	in	61	countries,	was	
recognized	with	the	prestigious	
Prix	Galien	USA	Award	as	the	
Best	Biotechnology	Product.	
STELARA®	is	in	Phase	III	
studies	for	the	treatment	of	
psoriatic	arthritis	and	Crohn’s	
disease,	and	Phase	II	studies	for	
the	treatment	of	sarcoidosis	and	
primary	biliary	cirrhosis.
	 SIMPONI®	(golimumab),	a	
once-monthly	subcutaneously	
administered	anti-TNF-alpha	
therapy,	has	now	achieved	
approvals	in	45	countries.	
SIMPONI®	is	in	Phase III	stud-
ies	for	treatment	of	ulcerative	
colitis	and	juvenile	idiopathic	
arthritis,	and	as	an	intravenous	
formulation	for	rheumatoid	
arthritis.	It	is	also	in	a	Phase	II 
study	for	sarcoidosis.
In	September,	REMICADE®	
(infliximab)	received	U.S.	
Food	and	Drug	Administration	
approval	as	the	first	biologic	
treatment	for	pediatric	ulcer-
ative	colitis,	marking	the		
16th	approval	in	the	U.S.		
REMICADE®	is	now	available		
in	106	countries.	
In	July,	marketing	rights	for

Across	the	Johnson	&	Johnson	Family

and	meet	consumer	needs.	Efforts	range	
from	marketing	and	educational	tools

Marketing for t oday’s  ConsuMe rs
Nearly	100	years	old,	BAND-AID®	Brand	is	
one	of	the	first	Johnson	&	Johnson	brands.	
The	NEOSPORIN®	brand,	which	joined	the	
Johnson	&	Johnson	trademark	portfolio	in	
2006	with	the	Pfizer	Consumer	Healthcare	
acquisition,	has	long	represented	the	gold	
standard	in	antibiotic	ointments.
“If	any	brands	were	naturally	meant	
to	be	together,	it’s	the	NEOSPORIN®	and	
BAND-AID®	Brands,”	says	Susan	Tang,	
Group	Brand	Director,	U.S.	Topical	Health

Consumer	Companies.	After	all,	she	notes,	
parents	have	trusted	them	for	generations	
to	care	for	their	children,	the	products

together,	provide	exceptional	wound	care.
	 Yet	only	2	percent	of	consumers	use	
an	antibiotic	cream	with	a	bandage,	
according	to	one	study.	To	reinforce	the	
message	that	the	products	should	be	used	
together,	Johnson	&	Johnson	Consumer	
Companies,	Inc.	developed	the	“Always

commercial	in	English	and	Spanish.	The	
BAND-AID®	Brand	Adhesive	Bandages		
use	QUILTVENT™	technology,	which	
promotes	breathability—a	feature	
consumers	have	said	they	want—and	
enables	the	bandage	to	wick	away	blood,	
leaving	the	wound	clean.
	 The	NEOSPORIN®	brand,	meanwhile,		
is	entering	the	eczema	skin	care	area		
with	NEOSPORIN®	ESSENTIALS™,		
three	new	products	designed	for	people	
with	eczema,	plus	a	trial	pack	that

which	contain	a	humectant,	emollient,	
lipid	and	botanical	blend	to	help	retain	
moisture,	which	is	essential	for	healthy-
looking	skin.
“We	put	so	much	heart,	sweat	and

says	Elena	Fernandez-Kleinlein,	Senior	
Director,	R&D,	Global	Topical	Health	Care,	
Johnson	&	Johnson	Family	of	Consumer	
Companies.	“We’re	proud	to	be	able	to

	 Other	heritage	brands	are	also	
launching	innovative	products	to	
meet	consumer	needs.	For	example,	
NEUTROGENA®,	a	58-year-old	iconic	
brand,	learned	from	consumer	insight		
that	parents	have	a	hard	time	getting	their

 Dear Shareholders,
Fiscal 2016 was a year of progress in our journey to return P&G’s results to a balance  
of top-line growth, bottom-line growth and cash generation. We increased investments 
in innovation, advertising and sales coverage to enhance our long-term prospects 
for faster, sustainable sales growth. We stabilized top-line growth rates in several 
key markets. We delivered another strong year of productivity improvement and cost 
savings. We made significant steps in our portfolio transformation — completing the 
Duracell transaction in February, negotiating and preparing for the sale of 41 beauty 
brands to Coty Inc., and streamlining the product lineups in our ongoing businesses.
We made this progress during a challenging year. We faced significant foreign 
exchange headwinds, which reduced sales growth by six percentage points and  
core earnings per share by nine percentage points. We faced slowing market 
growth, and economic and political disruptions in many large markets. We made 
choices to exit several lines of unprofitable business, which reduced organic sales 
growth. Earnings were impacted by reduced exports to Venezuela.
Despite these challenges, we delivered organic sales growth within our initial 
guidance range, and free cash flow productivity was above our initial expectations. 
Core earnings per share were at the low end of our initial guidance range due primarily 
to over half a billion dollars after-tax of incremental foreign exchange impacts that 
occurred after we had set our targets for the year. 
• All-in sales declined 8%; organic sales grew 1%
• All-in earnings per share increased 51%; core earnings per share declined 2% 
• Free cash flow was $12.1 billion, with adjusted free cash flow productivity of 115%

ii • The Procter & Gamble Company
We continued to build on our strong track record of returning cash to you, our 
shareholders. We paid $7.4 billion in dividends, increasing our dividend for the 60th 
consecutive year. We reduced shares outstanding by more than $8 billion through  
a combination of share repurchases and shares that were exchanged in the Duracell 
transaction. In total, P&G delivered nearly $16 billion of value for shareholders. 
We made progress in a challenging environment, but we know we need to do better.  
We are focused on streamlining and strengthening our product portfolio, improving 
productivity and our cost structure, building the foundation for stronger top-line  
growth, and strengthening our organization and culture. These are the choices we’re 
focused on to raise the bar on P&G’s performance to consistently deliver balanced 
growth and leadership value creation. 
Streamlining Our  
Product Portfolio
We’re organizing our portfolio around 10 category-based  
business units and about 65 brands. These are categories  
where P&G has leading market positions and where product 
technologies deliver performance differences that matter  
to consumers. We’re focusing on categories where product 
performance drives purchase decisions — where there  
are clear consumer jobs to be done and objective  
measures of performance. These are products in 
financially attractive categories, which consumers 
purchase and use on a daily basis. These 10 category- 
based business units have historically grown faster  
with higher margins than the balance of the company.
Within these core categories, we are streamlining  
our product lines. For example, we are making smart 
choices to discontinue undifferentiated, unprofitable  
and commoditizing products in favor of more profitable, 
consumer-preferred and differentiated products in a number of 
markets and businesses around the world, including Mexico, India 
and Fabric Care. Combined, these choices caused about a one-point drag 
on organic sales growth in fiscal 2016 and are expected to continue to be a  
headwind in fiscal 2017.

Improving Productivity and Cost Structure
We continue to improve cost and cash productivity with significant upside ahead. 
Productivity is the fuel for top- and bottom-line growth. We have delivered and 
exceeded $10 billion in savings over the past five fiscal years across cost of goods  
sold, marketing spending and overhead. 
In cost of goods sold, our original target was $6 billion in savings over five years,  
from fiscal 2012 to 2016. We delivered over $7 billion, with savings at or above  
target each year. 
In marketing spending, we have delivered strong savings over the last two years in  
non-working agency fees and commercial production costs. We’ve been reinvesting 
these savings in marketing programs that improve the reach, frequency or continuity  
of our advertising, and in programs such as product sampling that generate trial  
of our superior products.
In overhead, the decision to reduce enrollment was difficult, but was made with  
careful consideration of what is best for the health of the business. Since 2011,  
we have reduced non-manufacturing roles by about 25%, which is two-and-a-half 
times the original target. Including divestitures, we’ll reduce non-manufacturing  
roles by about 35% by the end of fiscal 2017.
Productivity cost savings have been essential to offset $4 billion of negative  
foreign exchange impacts over the last four years. These savings have enabled  
us to improve constant currency gross and operating profit margins and deliver  
high-single- to double-digit constant currency core earnings per share growth  
in each of these years. 
We believe we can deliver up to an additional $10 billion in productivity 
improvements over the next five years. As with the first $10 billion, we expect  
the large majority of our savings will come from cost of goods sold. 
Supply chain transformation is in its early stages. We started in North America. 
Europe is following, and then we will move on to Latin America and India,  
Middle East and Africa. We’re in investment mode now, with savings to ramp  
up over the next two to four years. 
More opportunity exists for savings in marketing spending, particularly in non- 
working fees and production costs. We will also optimize the reach, effectiveness  
and efficiency of media spending through the right mix of TV advertising and  
digital — across search, social, video and mobile — to reach consumers when  
and where they spend their time. 
As we fully operationalize the new, focused 10-category company, there will be 
additional opportunities to increase organization efficiency, agility and speed  
of decision making.
Finally, we are working to improve the effectiveness of our promotional spending  
by changing how we use these funds to give our sales teams more flexibility to invest  
in what drives the most profitable growth. We see clear opportunities to improve  
the effectiveness of promotional spending for us and for our retail partners to grow 
categories and brands profitably.
Going forward, we expect to reinvest a significant amount of the productivity 
savings back into the business. We’ll invest more in R&D, in product and packaging 
improvements, in sales coverage, in brand awareness and in trial-building programs.  
P&G wins when we create new categories and grow categories and brands.  
These investments are aimed at delivering balanced top- and bottom-line growth.

Supply Chain Efficiency
One way we’re increasing efficiency in our U.S. supply chain  
is through our six new mixing centers. They are strategically 
located closer to customers in key population centers, putting 
80% of our U.S. business within one day of the store shelf  
and the shopper. Shipping multiple categories per load  
allows more efficient use of every truck and more frequent 
customer deliveries. This is driving lower inventory, improving 
service to retailers, and increasing product availability for 
shoppers — delivering the right mix and the right amount, 
right on time.

Accelerating Top-Line Growth
Sales growth is our biggest improvement need, which is enabled by winning with 
consumers and fueled by both our productivity and portfolio strengthening efforts that 
are underway. Our objective is to consistently deliver organic sales growth ahead of 
underlying growth of the markets in which we compete. This level of top-line growth, 
balanced with consistent bottom-line growth and cash generation, is what’s needed  
to deliver leadership levels of value creation for P&G shareholders.
We’re making progress in accelerating organic sales growth. Organic sales for the  
April–June quarter were in line or higher than the previous year in 9 of 10 product 
categories. For nearly all of these businesses, the second half of the year was stronger 
than the first half. Organic sales for the company were essentially flat in the first half  
of the fiscal year and were up 1.5% in the second half — moving in the right direction,  
but there’s more work to be done.

vi • The Procter & Gamble Company
Everything starts with winning with consumers and shoppers. 
We must win with consumers and shoppers at the zero, first and second moments of 
truth — when consumers become aware of our categories and brands, purchase them in 
a store or online, and use them in their homes. Winning these moments requires insights 
that lead to superior-performing product innovations, effective advertising and strong 
retail programs. The outcome is growing the number of users — and usage — of our 
brands and the categories in which we compete. 
Growing users requires product superiority, broad media reach, advertising effectiveness, 
distinctive packaging, an easy-to-shop store shelf, sampling programs and consumer 
value. We’re raising the bar by asking key questions: Is the product better performing 
and most preferred by consumers? Do we have the media reach and effective advertising 
to ensure our brands are always top of mind? Is the packaging distinctive, familiar and 
appealing? Is the store shelf organized in a way that is easy to shop, enabling consumers 
to find the right product for them with the right benefits at the right price? Do we have 
sampling programs that allow people to try our best products, particularly at  
the point of market entry? Is the relative price and absolute cash outlay  
to purchase our brands a good consumer value? Every category and 
brand is focused on consistently delivering these drivers of growing  
users to grow category and brand sales. 
At the same time, we’re strengthening our go-to-market 
execution. Execution is what our consumers and shoppers  
experience when they are in the store or online. Our  
brands need to have the right selection of products,  
in the right sizes, at the right value, in the right quantity, 
and in the right points of sale to win with consumers  
and shoppers in stores and online every day. 
Innovating to Delight Consumers
PANTENE
TIDE
Pantene’s new breakthrough conditioner 
technology delivers ‘superior conditioning 
without weight,’ addressing a significant 
consumer trial barrier in the category.  
Our Pantene shampoo and conditioner 
systems are consumer blind test winners  
vs. our best competition in North America, 
China and Japan. And they are helping  
drive results — Pantene’s U.S. organic  
sales were up mid-single digits for the  
six months ended in June 2016.
Tide is now reaching more consumers and 
addressing two growing consumer needs: 
natural detergents and odor removal.  
Tide purclean is a breakthrough as the  
first bio-based detergent with the cleaning 
power of Tide. And with the growth of 
synthetic fibers and active lifestyles, odors 
are an increasing laundry concern. Using 
our Febreze technology, the Odor Defense 
regimen helps eliminate, neutralize and  
block tough odors. 
Superior-performing 
products lead to a 
delightful consumer 
experience, driving 
repeat purchase  
and loyalty.

Growing Users for  
a Stronger Top Line
Growing users is a key driver of balanced growth and value 
creation. Two of the ways we grow users of P&G brands are 
to offer superior-performing products to consumers and to 
increase consumer trial through sampling, particularly at  
the point of market entry.
Sampling  
is a winning  
strategy for growth. 
When people try our 
products, they are far 
more likely to buy them.

We’re strengthening brand awareness and 
trial at category entry. 70% of U.S. new 
moms now receive samples of our best 
Pampers products through our prenatal  
and hospital programs. Our latest innovation 
has our unique three Extra Absorb Channels 
that help distribute wetness evenly — unlike 
ordinary diapers that have one unstructured 
core. It’s driving growth, with Swaddlers  
and Cruisers U.S. share up well over one 
point in the June 2016 quarter.
Our U.S. 18th birthday sampling program 
has put Gillette Fusion ProGlide FlexBall 
razors in the hands of nearly 80% of young 
men — over two million in 2016, up 33% over 
the past two years. We’re now sampling the 
FlexBall handle and ProShield cartridge — our 
most advanced combination of technologies. 
ProShield launched in January and is the 
#1 razor in the U.S., the U.K. and Germany, 
based on sales. Over 40 million men globally 
are now shaving with FlexBall.

Strengthening Organization and Culture
Our choices — portfolio transformation, continued productivity improvement, and 
reaccelerating top-line growth — are enabled by a winning organization and culture. 
We are adjusting our talent development and assignment planning to improve mastery 
and depth. The objective is simple. We will improve business results by getting and 
keeping the right people in the right roles to develop and apply deep category mastery. 
For example, we’re dedicating sales resources to categories, enabling them to apply  
their mastery to drive category growth. 
We’re aligning incentives at a lower and more specific level of granularity to better  
match business responsibilities with results and to increase accountability.
P&G is fortunate to consistently source and develop strong talent, and we intend to 
maintain our develop-from-within approach. But there are times when the best talent  
for a role may not be inside our organization. Going forward, we will look selectively  
at outside hiring when we need it to field the best team possible. 
The bottom line is that we are committed to getting, keeping and growing the  
right people in the right places to drive better business results.
A winning organization is supported by a winning culture. P&G has a great  
culture — one of integrity, trust, ownership, leadership and a passion for winning.  
But we are strengthening our culture, putting increased emphasis on behaviors  
that lead to faster decision making and action, and taking personal accountability  
to raise the bar to deliver our best performance.
I deeply believe in P&G people. I’ve had the opportunity to work in multiple  
functions, countries and businesses, and have experienced the quality and capability  
of P&G people around the world. P&G people are truly our most valuable asset.  
Together, we will return P&G to balanced growth and value creation. 
Winning Consistently
We are encouraged and optimistic as we enter fiscal 2017. We expect this year to 
represent another step toward our goal of balanced top- and bottom-line growth  
and cash generation. We’re committed to continued productivity improvement  
and cost savings that provide the fuel for innovation and investments needed  
to accelerate and sustain faster top- and bottom-line growth. We’re nearing the  
completion of the major portfolio moves to simplify and strengthen the category 
portfolio. We are strengthening the organization and culture.
P&G is adapting, evolving and changing to do what is needed to win. We’re making 
progress in each of these areas, but we know our success will ultimately be graded on 
the sales, profit, cash and value creation results we deliver, not on the activities that  
get us there. We expect to make meaningful progress in fiscal 2017 toward our return 
to our long-term growth targets, but there is still work to do. It will take time for the 
benefits of the work and the investments we are making to be fully visible in our results.
We are committed to do everything we can to get P&G back to winning with consumers, 
and delivering consistent, reliable, balanced and sustainable growth and value creation 
for you, our shareholders.

15   STATEMENT OF THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT
Dear Shareholders,
The 2011 financial year was the best ever in the history of your Company, the BMW Group. We achieved 
new sales volume, revenues and earnings highs, and exceeded our targets.
The BMW Group remains the world’s top-selling premium car manufacturer  With almost 1.67 million 
vehicles sold, the BMW Group continues to be the world’s leading premium manufacturer in terms of sales 
volume. Our three automobile brands, BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce, also set new individual records. A further 
113,000 customers purchased a BMW or Husqvarna motorcycle. Our Financial Services business also con-
tributed to this positive sales development.
Revenues of € 68.8 billion and a profit before tax of more than € 7.3 billion also represent new highs for 
the Group. The BMW Group stands on a firm financial footing, maintaining our profitability. This provides 
us with additional flexibility in an uncertain environment and also gives us the ability to continue making 
important investments in the future.
Our capital expenditure of around € 3.7 billion in 2011 included investments in new products and the 
 expansion of our international production network. One thing is clear: we will continue to make major in-
vestments over the next few years. That is the only way to respond to growing demand for our vehicles and 
at the same time realise new drive technologies, industrialise electromobility and offer our customers 
 innovative mobility services. Our research and development expenses increased to more than € 3.3 billion in 
2011. This investment was primarily earmarked towards projects to secure our future growth.
We continue to strive for a good balance of growth between Europe, the Americas and Asia. We believe 
this is essential to economic success in a highly volatile environment. The same applies to our highly flexible 
international production network of 25 sites in 14 countries. In 2012, we will open a new plant in Tiexi, 
China. Future growth also exists in the BRIKT countries of Brazil, Russia, India, South Korea and Turkey. 
We intend to capitalise on this potential.
We are expanding our international presence in a global world. This will give us greater freedom from 
market and currency fluctuations, promoting our long-term success and enhancing our competitiveness. Not 
least, it will secure jobs in Germany and around the world. Germany continues to form the backbone of our 
production activities.
Consistent implementation of Strategy Number ONE is paying off  At the BMW Group, our ideas and 
actions are geared towards the long term. This is part of our corporate culture. Back in autumn 2007, before 
the global financial and economic crisis, we adopted our Strategy Number ONE with its four pillars: 
“Growth”, “Shaping the future”, “Profitability” and “Access to technology and customers”. This strategy lays 
out the guidelines for our Company to remain focused on profitability and long-term value creation in 
a changing environment and to achieve significant efficiency improvements. We set ourselves concrete 
profitability targets for 2012 and formulated our vision for 2020.
All of this has paid off – as our success in 2011 has shown. We deliver on our promises. As shareholders 
and investors, you support us in our long-term approach. I would like to thank you for your ongoing confidence 
in the Company and the decisions we make. 2011 confirmed that BMW shares are an attractive long-term 
 investment – as you have come to expect from a premium company.

Our success in 2012 and beyond  A clear focus on premium vehicles and premium services for individual 
mobility remains the core of our business model. We will continue to refine this approach. We do so in light 
of changing customer demands, stringent regulations and the demands placed on automobile manufacturers 
by different industrial policies in different countries. We reviewed our strategy in 2011 for this reason. All of 
our assumptions were verified against current trends and developments.
Our aim for the 2012 financial year is to build on past year’s success. We are targeting new highs in sales 
volume and pre-tax Group earnings. We intend to continue operating at a high level of profitability over the 
long term, which means maintaining an EBIT margin of between eight and ten per cent in the Automotive 
segment – assuming that there are no lasting negative economic conditions.
We benefit from an excellent starting position: we have a young and attractive product line-up. Regarding 
the BMW brand, the new BMW 3 Series will be playing a major role in 2012. The new BMW 3 Series Sedan 
has been available since mid-February. This was the first time we launched one of our models in all markets 
simultaneously. As well as incorporating a large number of technical innovations, our three lines, “Sport”, 
“Modern” and “Luxury”, will give customers even more choices for individualisation. We will also be adding 
the BMW brand’s new CO2 champion to our product range: the 163-horsepower BMW 320d EfficientDynamics 
Edition has a fuel consumption of 4.1 litres per 100 kilometres in the EU test cycle. This is equivalent to CO2 
emissions of 109 grams per kilometre. The BMW 320d will be followed in the autumn by the BMW ActiveHybrid 3, 
the world’s first fully hybrid compact sports sedan in the premium segment.
Another BMW product highlight this year will be the BMW 6 Series Gran Coupé. This vehicle, the first 
four-door coupé in the history of the BMW brand, will come onto the market in June. The revised BMW 7 Series 
will follow in July, bringing true luxury to the premium segment. The MINI family will expand to six 
 members in 2012 with the addition of the MINI Roadster. Rolls-Royce will maintain its successful course as 
the pinnacle of luxury motoring with its Phantom model series and the Rolls-Royce Ghost.
Shaping the mobility of tomorrow as a pioneer and trendsetter  We will begin series production of electric 
vehicles in late 2013 and intensive preparations are already underway. Electric propulsion is an option for 
all three of our brands. The first two concept cars from the new BMW i family attracted considerable attention. 
Our BMW i3 and BMW i8 prove that sustainable mobility and sheer driving pleasure go exceptionally well 
 together. At the same time, we are exploring totally new approaches to ensure environmentally and resource-
friendly production of BMW i models. The power for the assembly of BMW i models will be obtained solely 
from renewable sources – a first for the industry.
Resource-efficient production and sustainability are part of our premium promise. Measures to this effect 
are implemented at all our locations worldwide. As a result, the BMW Group has been rated the industry 
leader in all major sustainability rankings for many years.
Strategic alliances as part of Strategy Number ONE  The mobility of the future will take many forms. 
Accordingly, strategic collaborations with the best partners are an integral part of Strategy Number ONE. 
This secures long-term access to technologies and customers, pools expertise and achieves positive cost 
 effects through economies of scale. In our opinion, there are two key elements for good collaborations: first, 
the partnership must create a win-win situation. Second, the premium character and independence of our 
 vehicles and brands must always be assured.

17   STATEMENT OF THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT
In 2011 we opened a new production plant for carbon fibres in Moses Lake in the United States together 
with the SGL Group. It forms part of our international manufacturing network of ultra-light carbon-fibre 
 reinforced plastic (CFRP) for the BMW i family. Our years of experience using CFRP parts in automobile con-
struction give us a distinct advantage. Furthermore, we are positioning the BMW Group as a clear innovation 
leader in the field of lightweight construction.
We also strengthened our international multi-brand fleet management business with the acquisition of 
the ING Car Lease Group. As a result, the BMW Group now ranks among Europe’s top five fleet service 
 providers. With the expansion of our fleet management business, we are also laying an excellent foundation 
for developing modern mobility solutions and mobility services.
Our joint venture with PSA Peugeot Citroën was also successfully launched in 2011 as BMW Peugeot 
 Citroën Electrification. The joint development of components for electrification and hybridisation will also 
make the European automobile industry more competitive in the field of hybridisation.
A major breakthrough in electromobility will depend on further progress in lithium-ion battery technology. 
Our planned cooperation with Toyota Motor Corporation will contribute to this through joint research into 
battery cell technology.
The right approach to the challenges of our times  Business success depends on many different parameters. 
We believe that social responsibility and sustainable action are just as significant in this respect as growth, 
profitability and efficiency.
The Company’s success is only made possible through the dedication, creativity and team spirit of the 
 almost 100,000 employees of the BMW Group. On behalf of the Board of Management, I would like to thank 
all of our employees around the world for their commitment in 2011. I would also like to thank our entire 
 retail organisation, our suppliers and business partners.
The BMW Group is considered to be one of the most attractive employers. We recruited a total of 4,000 new 
staff in 2011, securing ourselves key competences for the future. We also embrace our responsibility for 
training young people. We increased the number of apprentices to 3,899 by the end of 2011.
We are shaping the mobility of today and tomorrow for our customers, and thereby building a stable 
foundation for the future of the BMW Group.
As our shareholders, you have continued to show your support and confidence in our abilities to manage 
the BMW Group. We strive to ensure that your Company remains an attractive investment and a profitable 
enterprise with a strong reputation and high level of credibility for years to come.
Norbert Reithofer
Chairman of the Board of Management

Record-breaking year for BMW Group 
The BMW Group experienced the best year of its corpo-
rate history in 2011, selling 1,668,982 BMW, MINI and 
Rolls-Royce brand cars (+ 14.2 %); this was more than 
ever  before in an annual period. With this performance, 
the BMW Group retains the pole position in the premium 
segment of the world’s car markets.
Sales volumes grew dynamically for all three car brands, 
each of them recording their best levels ever. Sales of 
BMW brand cars alone rose by 12.8 % to 1,380,384 units. 
A total of 285,060 units of the MINI brand were handed 
over to their new owners (+ 21.7 %). At 3,538 units, 
Rolls-Royce set a new sales volume record, posting an 
increase of 30.5 % on the previous year.
The Motorcycles segment put in another highly stable 
performance despite persistently unfavourable market 
conditions. In total, we handed over 113,572 BMW and 
Husqvarna brand motorcycles to customers during the 
year under report, 3.1 % more than in 2010. 
New records set both for revenues and earnings
Group revenues and earnings broke all existing records 
on the back of dynamic car sales volume growth and 
flourishing financial services business. Revenues in 
2011 totalled € 68,821 million, 13.8 % higher than in the 
previous year. Earnings were also strong, with profit 
 before financial result (EBIT) up by 56.9 % to € 8,018 
 million and profit before tax up by 52.1 % to € 7,383 mil-
lion.
The Automotive segment recorded a 16.8 % increase in 
revenues to € 63,229 million, with EBIT soaring to € 7,477 
million  (+ 71.7 %) and segment profit before tax reaching 
€ 6,823 million (+ 75.5 %).
Motorcycle segment revenues grew by 10.1 % to € 1,436 
million on the back of good sales volume performance. 
EBIT fell by 36.6 % to € 45 million, primarily due to re-
structuring measures taken at the level of Husqvarna. 
These measures also caused segment profit before tax to 
drop to € 41 million (– 36.9 %).
Financial Services business also made an important con-
tribution to the success of the BMW Group. With a 
 portfolio of 3,592,093 contracts in place with dealers 
and retail customers at the end of the year, the segment 
recorded growth of 12.6 %.
The Financial Services segment also performed ex-
tremely well, posting a 5.4 % increase in revenues to 
€ 17,510 million. In earnings terms, segment EBIT rose 
by 46.8 % to € 1,763 million and segment profit before 
tax by 47.4 % to € 1,790 million.

19   COMBINED GROUP AND COMPANY MANAGEMENT REPORT
Income tax expense for the year amounted to € 2,476 
million (+ 53.8 %), resulting in an effective tax rate 
of 33.5 %, marginally up on the previous year’s 33.2 %. 
Group net profit was significantly higher than in 2010, 
rising by 51.3 % to € 4,907 million.
Sharp increase in dividend
Reflecting the very strong earnings performance, the 
Board of Management and the Supervisory Board 
will propose to the Annual General Meeting to use 
BMW AG’s unappropriated profit of € 1,508 million to 
pay a dividend of € 2.30 for each share of common 
stock (2010: € 1.30) and a dividend of € 2.32 for each share 
of preferred stock (2010: € 1.32), a distribution rate of 
30.7 % for 2011 (2010: 26.5 %).
Capital expenditure increased
Capital expenditure on intangible assets and property, 
plant and equipment amounted to € 3,692 million in 
2011, 13.1 % higher than in the previous year (2010: 
€ 3,263 million). The main focus in 2011 was on product 
investments for new model start-ups (BMW 1 Series, 
3 Series), on infrastructure investments aimed at ex-
panding the production network and on the future pro-
duction of electric cars (BMW i3 and i8).
The BMW Group invested € 2,720 million in property, 
plant and equipment and other intangible assets in 
2011 (2010: € 2,312 million; + 17.6 %). Development 
 expenditure of € 972 million was additionally recog-
nised as assets (2010: € 951 million; + 2.2 %). The per-
centage of development costs capitalised decreased 
to 28.8 %, mainly due to model life cycle factors (2010: 
34.3 %).
The capital expenditure ratio for the year was unchanged 
at 5.4 % and therefore remained – thanks to the effi-
cient use of capital resources – well within the target 
range of below 7 % of Group revenues, despite substan-
tial  levels of investment in innovative products and 
technologies.
BMW Group strengthens market position in European 
fleet business
In July the BMW Group announced the purchase of ING 
Car Lease Group (ICL Group). This addition, combined 
with the existing Alphabet fleet business, increased 
the number of leasing and fleet management contracts 
handled by the BMW Group to approximately 540,000.

on the growing sector of full-service leasing. The expan-
sion of fleet management business provides the ideal 
foundation for developing forward-looking mobility so-
lutions and services.
BMW Group and SGL Group open new carbon fibre 
 production plant 
In September 2011, SGL Automotive Carbon Fibers – a 
joint venture of the BMW Group and the SGL Group – 
opened a new state-of-the-art carbon fibre manufacturing 
plant in Moses Lake, USA. The facility plays a major 
strategic role in the manufacture of ultra-lightweight 
carbon-fibre reinforced plastics (CFRP), which will be 
used extensively in the BMW i vehicles to be launched 
by the BMW Group from 2013 onwards.
CFRP is becoming increasingly important in the quest 
for lighter materials that minimise vehicle weight and 
thereby reduce both fuel consumption and CO2 emis-
sions. With their new production plant in Moses Lake, 
the BMW Group and the SGL Group are proving that 
targeted innovations can make a real eco-friendly con-
tribution towards the future of individual mobility.
Investment in SGL Carbon SE
BMW AG acquired 15.81 % of the share capital of SGL 
Carbon SE during the period under report, thus re-
inforcing our engagement in the area of lightweight 
 construction and the use of CFRP in carmaking.

General Economic Environment
Economic environment increasingly volatile
After a phase of global economic upswing that began 
in the second half of 2009, the last six months of 2011 
shows growing signs of a likely slowdown in the pace of 
worldwide economic growth in 2012. It also became 
 apparent that some of the world’s economies are facing 
a phase of stagnation.
Since summer 2011 the sovereign debt crisis plaguing 
the euro zone has given rise to a reassessment of the 
value of state bonds, shares and raw materials. In the 
short term, developments in the euro zone are likely 
to be the main single factor affecting global economic 
growth.
That having been said, rising public debt levels in the 
USA, alongside ongoing unsolved structural problems 
on the US employment and property markets also pose 
a risk to global economic growth in the current year, 
 despite any temporary signs of the situation stabilising.
Signs are emerging in China – currently the mainstay 
of global economic growth – of a significant increase 
in bad debts within the banking system, for which the 
property boom of recent years is partly to blame.
In view of these developments, forecasts for economic 
growth in 2012 have generally been scaled back. Fiscal 
policies, particularly in the USA, Europe and Japan, 
are likely to hold down growth for the time being. 
 Property markets in the USA, the UK and most of the 
euro zone continue to perform poorly. The situation in 
China is being exacerbated by the fact that property 
prices in major cities have been falling since mid-2011 
after having risen rapidly in the preceding years.
In terms of monetary policies, central banks in indus-
trial countries have more or less exhausted their re-
maining options in the period since the last crisis by 
adopting very expansive policies. Central banks in 
most emerging markets have also started to bring 
down interest rates in order to counter the negative im-
pact of a forthcoming global downturn on their local 
economies. The scope for interest rate reductions in 
these countries is, however, restricted by higher in-
flation rates. Reports on trading policies also raise fears 
of a new wave of regulation.
China was once again the main driver of global eco-
nomic growth in 2011, registering a growth rate in real 
terms of 9.0 % and, for the first time, contributing more 
than 10 % to global economic output. The growth rate 
lost impetus quite noticeably towards the end of the year 
as a result of lower revenues in the overheated property 
sector on the one hand and reduced export revenues on 
the other.
The growth rate in the USA – which still accounts for 
more than 20 % of global economic output – slowed 
down to 1.7 %, a significant drop on the previous year’s 
figure. High debt levels in the public sector and private 
sphere are proving to be a serious impediment to 
growth.
Markets in the euro zone developed highly diversely in 
2011. The average growth rate in the region was 1.6 %. 
With the exception of Germany, where the export- 
oriented economy again grew at the fairly healthy rate 
of 3.0 %, most of the other countries in Europe only re-
ported moderate growth. France's growth rate of 1.6 % 
was roughly in line with the average for the euro zone. 
The southern European countries and Ireland fared 
considerably worse due to a loss of confidence in their 
economies. The Italian and Spanish economies verged 
on stagnation, with growth rates in the region of 
0.5 %. Growth in Greece and Portugal continued to de-
teriorate. Germany is therefore one of the few countries 
within the euro zone to have returned to the economic 
output levels seen prior to the onset of the financial cri-
sis in autumn 2008.
The British economy, too, only recovered sluggishly from 
the financial crisis, posting growth of 0.9 % in 2011. 
Tax increases and spending cuts due to the government’s 
fiscal policies continued to dampen the employment 
market and discourage consumer spending, whilst mon-
etary policies allowed inflation to rise to the unusually 
high rate of 4.5 %.
The Japanese economy – beset by the natural catastro-
phe which caused massive restrictions in energy supplies 
and production cuts affecting industrial activities – 
was pushed into recession and contracted by 0.7 % com-
pared to the previous year.
The pace of economic growth also slowed in the major

Making Ever-better Cars and Our Strategic 
Shift toward Electriﬁ cation, Information,

Based on the Toyota 
Global Vision, announced 
in March 2011, Toyota 
strives to implement a 
positive cycle of making 
ever-better cars that 
exceed customer expec-
tations, enriching lives of 
communities, being 
rewarded with the smiles 
of customers and commu-
nities, and thus reinforcing

its stable base of business in order to grow sustain-
ably in concert with society. As it faces the greatest 
changes to the automobile in a century, Toyota’s 
long-term strategy is to advance management based 
on its vision of the future mobility society of 2030.
  Since the birth of the automobile in the 18th centu-
ry, the mobility of people and things has increased 
dramatically. Today, it is possible to provide conve-
nient transportation to virtually anywhere at any time. 
The development of mobility has underpinned eco-
nomic growth and the development of society and 
culture. The heart of this evolution has been the 
steady improvement of vehicle performance, safety, 
and convenience.
  Now, changes driven by innovation in automated 
driving technologies that employ artiﬁ cial intelligence 
(AI), connected car technologies, robotics, and other 
areas are on the verge of linking cars, people, and 
social infrastructure in new ways, transforming indus-
try, society, and the very ways we live. 
  We believe that our customers today greatly enjoy 
car ownership—they feel attached to their cars and 
appreciate car design and the fun of driving. However, 
with environmental and resource-related problems 
growing more severe, cars are increasingly being seen 
as emblematic of pollution and the waste of energy 
and resources. 
  The technologies driving the rapid changes in the 
business environment surrounding cars, such as 
electriﬁ cation, connected systems, and AI, have the 
potential to provide never-before-seen value. They 
are also driving the provision of social value by, for 
example, helping to eliminate trafﬁ c accidents and 
environmental burden. Going forward, the costs 
associated with these technologies, such as those of 
enhancing functionality to meet needs related to 
environmental regulations, automated driving tech-
nology, and connected technologies, may signiﬁ cant-
ly impact our businesses. However, mobility services 
and connected services that utilize such technologies 
also present opportunities to create new revenue 
models. Based on this understanding, we believe 
that Toyota must now endeavor to both make ever-
better cars in order to sustain and enhance the auto-
mobile manufacturing business, its current mainstay, 
and shift to new business models for the future. 
  To make ever-better cars, we are striving to 
enhance the speciﬁ c appeal of each type of car, 
whether it be a Lexus, part of our GR sports car 
series, or a Land Cruiser, clearly deﬁ ning the role and 
key characteristics of each. By doing so, we provide 
value in the form of uniquely Toyota cars that will be 
cherished and appreciated by customers for years 
and years. At the same time, by making a strategic 
shift toward electriﬁ cation, information, and intelli-
gence to build new business models, we are 
expanding our range of business. 
In these ways, we will not only continue to evolve 
our existing car manufacturing business, but expand 
the scope of innovation to encompass social plat-
forms that meet society’s needs and technological 
platforms, such as AI, that extend beyond cars. By 
doing so, we aim to provide broad-ranging value that 
exceeds customer expectations as we work to cre-
ate the mobility society of the future. 
  There is a limit to what Toyota can do to provide 
such future value. To blaze the trail toward a new 
mobility society, we must ﬁ nd partners who share our 
aspirations and will inspire us to continue pushing 
forward while cooperating and competing with play-
ers in other industries.

Focused on the Mobility of the Future
Eco-car Strategy: Electriﬁ cation 
Toyota is exploring all available options in powertrain 
development. We believe that we can build a highly 
energy efﬁ cient mobility society by allowing govern-
ments and markets to select the cars best suited to 
regional energy and infrastructure conditions and 
allowing customers to choose the cars with the spe-
ciﬁ c characteristics best suited to their needs. 
  For the time being, the further development of 
technologies for conventional engines, which are still 
the mainstream, is a practical, highly realistic way to 
help reduce CO2 emissions. At the same time, we are 
working to develop and increase the use of fuel cell 
vehicles (FCVs), the ultimate eco-cars, and advancing 
other initiatives in coordination with diverse stakehold-
ers to realize our goal of establishing a low-carbon 
society that uses hydrogen. We are also accelerating 
the development of electric vehicles (EVs), another 
zero-emission vehicle option. To this end, we have 
established the EV Business Planning Department 
and a business and capital alliance with Mazda Motor 
Corporation, launching a new company to implement 
joint technological development. 
  Toyota boasts a wealth of accumulated know-how 
regarding vehicle electriﬁ cation technology and com-
mercialization that dates back to the launch of the 
Prius 20 years ago. We will continue to advance ini-
tiatives to accelerate our technological development 
and further reduce CO2 emissions. 
Connected Strategy: Information
Big data collected from cars will enable a wide range 
of new mobility services, such as accident and 
breakdown prediction, the generation of dynamic 
maps using probe data (vehicle tracking information 
generated using GPS), and agent functions to help 
users drive safely and comfortably. 
  Aiming to build new business models, Toyota is 
shifting toward a focus on electriﬁ cation, intelligence, 
and information, and has created what it calls 
Connected Strategy. The three pillars of this strategy 
are as follows. 1. Connect all cars to build a data col-
lection platform, 2. Utilize big data to revolutionize 
Toyota’s business, and 3. Collaborate with partners 
in various other industries and IT companies to pro-
duce new mobility services. 
  We aim to combine Toyota’s strengths—such as 
know-how developed in the automobile manufactur-
ing business and contact with customers through 
sales of more than 10 million vehicles annually—and 
the strengths of companies in other industries, 
including IT. By doing so, even as car usage shifts 
from ownership toward service-based models, we 
are working to create a safe, convenient, and excit-
ing future mobility society by providing customers 
with appealing services. 
Automated Driving and Utilizing AI: Intelligence
Toyota’s overall development philosophy for auto-
mated driving technology is the Mobility Teammate 
Concept, an approach built on the belief that people 
and vehicles can work together in the service of safe, 
convenient, and efﬁ cient mobility.
  We believe that it is essential that we develop auto-
mated driving technology to be human-centric and, 
above all, safe. In addition to sophisticated safe driving 
assistance, we are developing automated systems 
that can perform full-time dynamic driving. At the 
same time, by utilizing our advanced safety technolo-
gy know-how, we are working to promote the rapid 
uptake of new safety technologies in the market.
  Toyota has established Toyota Research Institute, 
Inc., with Dr. Gill Pratt, one of the world’s foremost AI 
researchers, as its CEO, and set up a related venture 
capital fund. Through these efforts, we are accelerat-
ing initiatives in such areas as automated driving, AI, 
and robotics. 
  Toyota believes that safe, fun automated driving 
technologies will expand freedom of movement for 
all, bringing cars and people even closer together, 
such that cars will continue to be loved by people.

Advancing Our Business Structure
Toyota is working to enhance its true competitive-
ness, particularly in the automobile manufacturing 
business, and shifting to new business models. In 
line with these strategies, we are advancing initiatives 
focused on ensuring ongoing growth 10 years from 
now, 20 years from now, and beyond. Seeking to 
break free of the restraints of Toyota’s existing con-
ventions and rules, we have started from scratch, 
focusing on the future as we set about to advance 
business innovation. Ongoing growth will be impossi-
ble unless we overcome the major issues created by 
Toyota’s expansion. Today, Toyota makes and sells 
more than 10 million automobiles annually. To survive 
at this scale, we are establishing new ways of oper-
ating to achieve the following two targets. 
(cid:129)  Develop a sufﬁ cient number of people who can 
lead with quick judgment, quick decisions and

(cid:129)  Reduce the time and effort consumed by cross-

  One of Toyota’s traditional strengths has been the 
process by which its experts on each function and 
process engage in thorough discussion to ﬁ nd opti-
mal solutions. However, before we began our current 
efforts to advance business innovation, overemphasis 
on function-based logic and reasoning had become a 
weakness, leaving Toyota unable to make quick deci-
sions in response to a rapidly changing environment.  
  Toyota regards the changes it has been making as 
opportunities. We seek to take on new challenges, 
unrestrained by existing approaches and remember-
ing always that there are better methods waiting to 
be discovered.
Making Ever-better Cars and 
Developing People
Toyota has revised its internal organization a number 
of times to enhance true competitiveness and pro-
mote sustainable growth.
In 2011, we adopted a system of autonomous 
region-based management, stationing the chief ofﬁ cers 
responsible for each region in their respective regions to 
ensure operations are more closely linked with local 
communities. In 2013, we adopted the Business Unit 
System, under which we organized workﬂ ows by busi-
ness model. Through these efforts, we made progress 
toward achieving management closely rooted in local 
areas and speedy product development. 
  At the same time, however, it became clear that 
even with these changes, Toyota’s ways of operating 
were still basically extensions of the old forms, and

thus carried with them the same problems— 
coordination across functions and decision making 
were taking too long. 
In April 2016, we adopted a new system with 
smaller business units organized around products, 
aiming to dissolve the barriers between functions, 
reduce the need for cross-unit coordination, speed 
up decision making, and better link all the work we 
do to making ever-better cars while developing 
human resources to support that goal. 
  Speciﬁ cally, we concentrated our forward-looking 
R&D and production engineering teams within the 
Advanced R&D and Engineering Company and estab-
lished four vehicle-based companies specializing in 
compact cars, mid-size cars, commercial vehicles 
(CVs), and the Lexus brand. We furthermore concen-
trated powertrain component-related operations in the 
Powertrain Company and connected technology-
related operations in the Connected Company.
  The new product-based companies serve to remove 
all barriers between functions, consolidating the entire 
process from planning to production under the authority 
and responsibility of a single leader and providing all 
necessary business functions within a compact struc-
ture for streamlined, integrated operations. 
  Toyota also reorganized its head ofﬁ ce, which is 
responsible for corporate functions. We established 
the Corporate Strategy Division, charged with formu-
lating long-term strategy for ongoing growth, and the 
Frontier Research Center, responsible for actively 
incorporating insight from outside the Company to 
create the technologies and businesses of the future 
from a long-term, society-oriented perspective. 
  Continuing our business innovation efforts, we 
established the EV Business Planning Department in 
December 2016. Then, in January 2017, we created 
the Emerging-market Compact Car Company, aiming 
to bring highly competitive ever-better cars to market 
based on Daihatsu Motor Co., Ltd.’s approach to 
manufacturing affordable, high-quality products. 
In this way, we set up the EV business as an internal 
start-up under the direct control of the president. This 
too was in order to make a clean break from old hab-
its and establish fast ways of operating to help drive 
Toyota’s overall efforts to advance business innovation.  
In April 2017, a year after transitioning to the new 
system, in line with our ongoing Company-wide busi-
ness innovation efforts, we established the GAZOO 
Racing Company, aiming to leverage our accumulat-
ed motor sports know-how to develop and release 
cars that offer customers true Waku-doki (excitement 
and exhilaration that wows you). We also consolidat-
ed our regional business units into the Business 
Planning & Operation Unit, unifying region-based 
operations to facilitate cooperation with the product-
based companies.  
  The new framework has enabled the consolidation 
of responsibility and authority in the company presi-
dents, helping to speed decision making. 
  Furthermore, the new framework has helped us oper-
ate with a greater awareness of the entire car manufac-
turing process. This has brought to light previously 
unnoticed issues, and better positioned us to ﬂ exibly 
change organizational frameworks going forward. 
  Toyota is stepping up its competitiveness by 
making ever-better cars while making a strategic 
shift toward electriﬁ cation, information, and intel-
ligence to advance initiatives aimed at expanding 
future mobility value. To achieve the goals of our 
long-term strategies, we are developing human 
resources and revamping internal structures and 
advancing business innovation while reinforcing 
alliances with a wide range of partners, including 
those in other industries. Looking at the enor-
mous changes surrounding cars as opportunities, 
Toyota is steadily advancing toward the creation 
of a better mobility society.

Eco-car Strategy: Electriﬁ cation 
Toyota considers responding to environmental issues a top management 
priority and has long endeavored to contribute to the realization of a sus-
tainable mobility society. To this end, we have taken on tremendous 
challenges, resulting in, for example, the release of the world’s ﬁ rst mass-
produced hybrid vehicle, the Prius, in 1997, and a fuel cell vehicle, the 
Mirai, in 2014. 
  Nevertheless, severe heat, heavy rainfall, drought, and other extreme 
weather phenomena attributable to climate change caused by rising lev-
els of greenhouse gases continue to threaten livelihoods around the 
world. Furthermore, the world’s reserves of oil, the main energy source 
that powers cars, are not inﬁ nite. In response to these circumstances, in 
2015, Toyota unveiled the Toyota Environmental Challenge 2050, starting 
work on six challenges aimed at not only eliminating CO2 emissions, but 
making a net positive impact on the planet and society. 
  The ﬁ rst of the six challenges is the New Vehicle Zero CO2 Emissions 
Challenge, under which we aim to reduce global average new vehicle 
CO2 emissions by 90% from Toyota’s 2010 global level. Toyota is devel-
oping and promoting the use of a variety of eco-cars to help achieve the 
Paris Agreement* goal of keeping global warming below 2°C.
*  The Paris Agreement, reached in December 2015, was negotiated at the 21st yearly session of 
the Conference of the Parties (COP 21) to the United Nations Framework Convention on 
Climate Change, held in Paris. The agreement set the long-term goal of limiting global warming 
to well below 2°C compared with pre-industrial levels and calls for net zero anthropogenic 
greenhouse gas emissions to be reached during the second half of the 21st century. 
Toyota’s Environmental Technology Strategy
Toyota believes that it is vital to pass down to the next generation the 
gains in the mobility of people and things achieved thus far by global 
mobility society while also addressing climate change and the uncertain 
future of petroleum resources. We are therefore focusing efforts on 
developing eco-cars that save energy and use diverse fuels while also 
promoting their widespread use. Automotive fuels can be produced by 
processing a variety of primary energy resources. By developing different 
powertrains optimized for a range of such fuels, Toyota is working to 
save energy and respond to fuel diversiﬁ cation.
  As illustrated in the chart entitled “Alternative Fuel Comparison” on the 
next page, there are multiple alternatives to petroleum, each with its own 
pros and cons. Similarly, energy policy varies by country and region. 
Toyota is advancing development on all fronts, including hybrid vehicles 
(HVs), plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHVs), fuel cell vehicles (FCVs), and electric 
vehicles (EVs). Each type of eco-car has a unique set of characteristics. 
By enabling customers to pick eco-car that is right for them, we believe 
that we are helping to build a highly energy-efﬁ cient mobility society.

Eco-car Strategy: Electriﬁ cation 
Accelerating Electriﬁ cation Initiatives
Toyota is advancing development on all fronts, with a particular focus on 
electric and hydrogen power, which it views as especially promising 
approaches to fuel diversiﬁ cation. FCVs offer convenience on par with 
conventional gasoline vehicles in terms of cruising range and refueling 
time. Moreover, hydrogen can be produced from a wide variety of mate-
rials and used for a wide range of applications. And, while EVs currently 
face hurdles due to battery limitations, namely cruising range and charg-
ing time, they offer the advantages of being chargeable at home and 
requiring only relatively simple infrastructure development. Policies and 
regulations aimed at promoting the use of zero-emission vehicles are 
developing rapidly around the world. Toyota believes that it is therefore 
necessary to advance the development of eco-cars in a way that is 
responsive to the energy challenges and infrastructure of each country 
and region as well as the ways customers use vehicles. 
  We take such an approach with EVs, one zero-emission vehicle 
option; at the end of 2016, we set up the EV Business Planning 
Department as an internal start-up aimed at creating and releasing prod-
ucts based on the market characteristics of individual countries and 
regions. Aiming to quickly bring EVs to market, the new department is 
amassing a wide range of technological know-how and resources from 
the Toyota Group, such as those of Toyota Industries Corporation, Aisin 
Seiki Co., Ltd., and DENSO Corporation, working within a small 
 corporate structure to advance development at a speed not seen before. 
  We entered a business and capital alliance with Mazda Motor Corporation 
toward the goal of making more-appealing cars, announced in August 2017. 
One aim of this alliance is joint development of technologies for electric cars. 
Demand and expectations for EVs are growing worldwide. Details are yet to 
be determined, but Toyota and Mazda are considering the joint development 
of technologies for the basic structure of competitive electric vehicles. These 
technologies will enable rapid, ﬂ exible response to changing regulations and 
market conditions. To the extent necessary for the joint development of EVs, 
we aim to combine the strengths of both companies and freely share know-
how related to EVs in order to nimbly and efﬁ ciently respond to difﬁ cult-to-
predict changes in the EV market during the development period. In addition, 
in late September 2017, Mazda, Denso, and Toyota signed a joint technology 
development agreement related to basic structural technologies and estab-
lished EV C.A. Spirit Corporation to facilitate said development. 
  Toyota’s Corolla Hybrid and Levin Hybrid, equipped with hybrid units pro-
duced in China, have been well received in the Chinese market. We intend to 
release plug-in hybrid variants of the Corolla and Levin in this market in 2018 
and are considering plans to introduce EVs within a few years. 
  The development of both EVs and FCVs presents opportunities to 
leverage Toyota’s electriﬁ cation technologies, which have been honed by 
its extensive know-how and experience regarding hybrid technology, one 
of Toyota’s core technologies. 
  As our competitors also accelerate their electriﬁ cation initiatives, we 
expect that competition to procure onboard batteries will intensify. 
Among secondary batteries, which can be repeatedly charged and used, 
lithium ion batteries offer the best performance in terms of power and 
energy per unit mass and volume. Toyota developed the world’s ﬁ rst 
method for observing the behavior of lithium ions contained in lithium ion 
batteries’ electrolyte solution during charging and discharging. This is 
expected to lead to new insights in research and development aimed at 
improving battery performance and durability, helping to enhance the 
cruising distance and battery life of PHVs and EVs. 
  Lithium ion batteries employ ﬂ ammable organic solvents, so they must 
be built to prevent leaks. Given this, Toyota is advancing R&D aimed at 
creating a solid-state battery that will serve as a high-performance, next-
generation battery. In addition to R&D conducted by our own dedicated 
internal R&D divisions, we are working with universities and other 
research organizations in this area. 
Building a Low-carbon Society
Spurred by the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics, further develop-
ment toward the creation of a hydrogen society is expected in the coming 
years. Toyota seeks to contribute to this development. Since the 2014 
release of the Mirai, Toyota has continued to focus on technological

To Our Shareholders
In 2013, we celebrated the 70th anniversary of Our Credo. The words written by
General Robert Wood Johnson are just as relevant today as they were in 1943 and
remind us of the deep responsibility we have to the doctors, nurses, patients, mothers
and fathers — and all those we are privileged to serve. It’s Our Credo that ignites our
passion to strike out in new directions with boldness, with purpose, and with a sense
of unlimited potential about what the future of health care might bring. Our Credo
also unites the employees of Johnson & Johnson in a common mission to make
positive, measurable differences and help people everywhere live longer, healthier and
happier lives.
For 70 years, Our Credo has also guided our decision-making through the
challenges and complexities that have confronted our world. No matter what unique
challenges have come to each generation—whether it was global pandemics,
economic uncertainty, world wars, population growth or technological advances—
Johnson & Johnson has stayed focused on our mission. Over the years, we’ve
improved patient care and the quality of life for millions of people worldwide by
delivering surgical innovations, breakthroughs in medicine and legendary products
that have stood the test of time. For many of us, the simple scent of JOHNSON’S®
Baby Powder or JOHNSON’S® Baby Shampoo brings happy memories, even while
ALEX GORSKY
Chairman, Board of Directors, and
Chief Executive Officer
they create new memories today for millions of parents, children and grandparents in nearly 200 countries around the world.
Inspired by this legacy, all of us at Johnson & Johnson are also fully committed to addressing the challenges and opportunities that
surely lie ahead in health care. As I travel around the world and speak with leaders in health care, government, and business, I hear a
consistent theme of concern and uncertainty. In a world challenged by a growing number of diseases, aging populations, insufficient
health care delivery and rising costs, stakeholders everywhere see the need to provide better outcomes and solutions for individuals,
families, communities, countries and all stakeholders. This is a call to action for all of us at Johnson & Johnson to take a leadership role
in addressing these issues in an increasingly complex, connected, and demanding world.
I’m very proud to say that against this backdrop, our businesses delivered strong results in 2013, led by the outstanding
performance in our Pharmaceutical segment; the strength of key brands in our U.S. over-the-counter (OTC) medicines business; and
continued progress in integrating Synthes, Inc. into our Medical Devices and Diagnostics business. We also advanced our longer-
term growth drivers of bringing innovative solutions to the global health care market and executing with excellence.
A key goal for us has been to prioritize our product portfolios, be decisive, and focus our energies in areas where we have the
greatest opportunities to lead and meet the evolving needs of customers in markets around the world. We’ve made strong progress on
this front in each of our segments last year and made significant contributions to advancing patient and consumer care.
With this focus and our industry leadership, we delivered strong sales results:
• Pharmaceuticals accounted for 39 percent of our total sales on an outstanding operational growth of 12 percent
compared to 2012.
• Medical Devices and Diagnostics represented 40 percent of our sales with operational growth of 6.1 percent.
• Our Consumer segment generated the remaining 21 percent, up 2.8 percent on an operational basis versus 2012.
Our depth of leadership is reflected in the fact that approximately 70 percent of our sales come from products with the number
one or number two global market share position. With these strong sales results, we delivered adjusted earnings per share* growth of
8.2 percent and strong free cash flow** of nearly $14 billion.
I am pleased with the progress we have made in the two years I have been honored to serve as the Chief Executive Officer of
Johnson & Johnson, and there remains so much more to do in the global health care space. Too many regions across the world—from
developed to emerging markets—are still far from providing high-quality health care to the people who need it. As the world’s largest
health care company, serving more than one billion patients and consumers around the world every day, we do not just consider it
our responsibility to do all we can to reach the next billion, and the billion after that—we consider it a responsibility and privilege.
By bringing the values embodied in Our Credo to life while focusing on four long-term drivers of growth—creating value through
innovation; expanding global reach with local focus; maintaining a laser focus on excellence in execution; and leading with purpose to
make a difference in the world—we have set our sights on achieving even greater progress in the years to come.
2013 CHAIRMAN’S LETTER

--- Page 4 ---
2013 BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS
Johnson & Johnson exceeded our financial commitments for 2013.
• Innovating in Pharmaceuticals. The performance of our Pharmaceutical business segment was exceptional. We are the
fastest growing top 10 pharmaceutical company in the U.S., Europe and Japan. Our success is driven by great science which
has consistently delivered meaningful advancements for patients over existing therapies. The 13 new products we have
launched since 2009, coupled with other core brands like PREZISTA® (darunavir) for HIV treatment and REMICADE®
(infliximab), a treatment for a number of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, greatly contributed to our growth. We
expect our pharmaceutical pipeline to continue growing in 2014.
• Successfully Integrating Synthes. Integrating Synthes continues to be a priority and we have made good progress. DePuy
Synthes Companies is the world’s largest and most comprehensive orthopaedics company and it is primed to offer new,
value-added solutions that will help transform health care delivery from the operating room to a patient’s mobility. While
we still have work to do, I am encouraged to see cross-selling initiatives we envisioned from the onset taking hold as well as
revenue and cost-saving synergies that will make the business even more competitive going forward.
• Driving Growth by Restoring Consumer Reliability. In our Consumer business segment, we made significant progress in
restoring a reliable supply of over-the-counter (OTC) products to the U.S. marketplace and we are starting to see them gain
traction, particularly TYLENOL® and MOTRIN®, which helped drive U.S. OTC growth of 19.7 percent. U.S. OTC brands
ended 2013 with the number one and number two product SKUs in both the adult and pediatric pain product categories.
We have also identified specific consumer need states and 12 major brands that will drive growth, including
NEUTROGENA®, LISTERINE® and JOHNSON’S® Baby.
• Rewarding our shareholders. Our shareholders were rewarded with a total return of almost 35 percent***, which outpaced
nearly every major index we benchmark ourselves against. Johnson & Johnson has delivered 30 consecutive years of
adjusted earnings* increases and we are one of only six companies in the S&P 100 to have delivered 51 consecutive years of
dividend increases.
More details are available about each of our three business segments in the 2013 Business Highlights section of this Annual
Report and in our 2013 Digital Annual Report, available at http://www.2013annualreport.jnj.com. You can also watch
highlights from my January 2014 speech at our Annual Business Review at:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdvHMmSot14
OUR FOUR DRIVERS OF LONG-TERM GROWTH
First, We are Creating Value Through Innovation
At Johnson & Johnson, everything we do begins with innovation. For the past five years, we’ve consistently invested about 11
percent of sales to support our R&D efforts. That equated to over $8 billion enterprise-wide in 2013, and by leveraging the power of our
enterprise, we are increasing our overall effectiveness and efficiency in the global marketplace.
• Our research and development continues to deliver results. Our investments in R&D are helping us continually deliver
meaningful innovations for our customers. About 25 percent of our sales have come from products we have introduced in
just the past five years.
• We gained or held market share. In 2013, in 14—out of 18—key in-line product platforms, we gained or held market share.
• Our pharmaceutical pipeline was productive. Our Pharmaceutical business saw great productivity from our pipeline,
including the launch of three new major medicines: INVOKANA® (canagliflozin) for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes,
IMBRUVICA™ (ibrutinib) for mantle cell lymphoma, and OLYSIO™ (simeprevir) for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C.
• Important new medical devices were approved. Our Medical Devices and Diagnostics business saw the U. S. Food & Drug
Administration approve EVARREST™ Fibrin Sealant Patch, a novel product that rapidly and reliably aids in stopping
bleeding during surgery. The ENSEAL® G2 Articulating Tissue Sealer makes it easier for surgeons to access difficult-to-
reach parts of the anatomy, and our THERMOCOOL® SMARTTOUCH® Catheter enhances the safety and efficacy of
ablation procedures. These innovations have strengthened our worldwide leadership position in medical devices and
diagnostics, where 85 percent of our key platforms hold the number one or number two position in the market.
• We launched new consumer products globally. In our Consumer segment, we continue to expand globally with the acquisition
of Shanghai Elsker Mother & Baby Co., Ltd, a leading baby care products company for the Chinese market and by launching
LISTERINE® ADVANCED DEFENCE® Gum Treatment in the United Kingdom and Ireland.
JOHNSON & JOHNSON 2013 ANNUAL REPORT

--- Page 5 ---
• We created new Johnson & Johnson Innovation Centers. We announced the creation of the Johnson & Johnson Innovation
Centers with locations in London, Shanghai, Boston, San Francisco and San Diego. These customized collaborations are part
of our enterprise-wide strategy to support an international network of scientific entrepreneurs through access to best-in-
class laboratory facilities and scientific expertise.
Second, We are Bringing To Life Our Global Reach with Local Focus
Johnson & Johnson is truly a global company, with more than 275 operating companies in 60 countries. While we are headquartered
in the United States, our mindset is global—we are focused on new products, new technologies and new business models that truly
connect with the way our customers live. Today, 55 percent of Johnson & Johnson’s business comes from outside the United States, and
that number is growing—as 22 percent of our sales come from fast growing emerging markets such as Brazil, Russia, India and China.
• We created a unified business model in China. Johnson & Johnson was one of the first western companies to expand into
China 28 years ago. Our locally based, broad range of businesses gives us unique insight into China’s health care challenges,
including an aging population. That’s why we have created Johnson & Johnson China, a new model that unifies our core
business segments and allows us to identify and facilitate the creation of new opportunities in China’s rapidly growing health
care system.
• We have taken a unified “go-to-market” approach in Southeast Asia. In Southeast Asia, we have aligned our operations and
management under a single business model called “One Johnson & Johnson” for nine countries, including Thailand,
Indonesia and the Philippines. We believe this streamlined approach gives us a market advantage to operate more efficiently
and effectively in smaller and mid-sized markets.
Third, We are Maintaining a Laser Focus on Excellent Execution
Nowhere is the need for excellence in execution more critical than in health care. Strategy is only as good as the ability to execute
flawlessly—focusing and setting priorities; doing the right thing and not just getting it done; meeting milestones and delivering on our
commitments. Excellence in execution starts with quality, a top priority at Johnson & Johnson, and one embodied in Our Credo by a
commitment that “everything we do must be of high quality.” In 2013:
• We restored more of our products to shelves. We met our objective of restoring approximately 75 percent of our planned
U.S. OTC products to store shelves.
• We have implemented a new quality and compliance operating model. We’ve taken important steps to ensure the quality
and safety of our products by adopting a single, global set of quality standards. We’ve also established a single Medical Safety
organization focused on ensuring that our in-market products perform as intended.
• We’ve strengthened and streamlined our supply chain to ensure that we reliably meet demand for our products. We’ve
raised the bar and created a single global enterprise Supply Chain organization in order to ensure the development and
production of high-quality products. This has helped us improve our customer service and reliability performance and will
better position us for future growth.
Fourth, We are Leading with Purpose to Make a Difference
Guided by Our Credo, our citizenship and sustainability priorities focus on advancing human health and well-being, safeguarding
the planet, and leading a strong and responsible business:
• We are helping to advance the United Nations Millennium Development Goals. One example of this legacy is our
commitment to the United Nations Millennium Development Goals focused on the well-being of mothers and children
around the world, including geographic locations where the needs are the greatest and the resources are most scarce. Our
commitment focuses on five key areas where we have developed strong, innovative partnerships. First, making childbirth
safer. Second, treating and preventing intestinal worms in children. Third, using mobile phones to share vital health
information with new and expectant mothers. Fourth, eliminating mother-to-child transmission of HIV. Fifth, piloting and
scaling therapeutic innovation through research and development to treat HIV, tuberculosis and neglected tropical diseases.
• We are supporting over 500 communities globally. We contributed about $1 billion in products and cash and supported
over 500 community programs in more than 60 countries.
• We are helping to fight tuberculosis by making medicine more available. We are committed to advancing global health to
fight multi-drug resistant tuberculosis by working with health authorities to make SIRTURO® (bedaquiline) more available
in countries like Russia where outbreaks have become more prevalent.
2013 CHAIRMAN’S LETTER

--- Page 6 ---
• We created a novel donation program to increase access to our HIV medicines in Africa. The Janssen pharmaceutical
companies of Johnson & Johnson announced a first-of-its-kind pediatric HIV treatment donation program to improve
access to the company’s approved HIV medicines PREZISTA® (darunavir) and INTELENCE® (etravirine) for children
and adolescents failing HIV treatment in sub-Saharan Africa. Tragically, only a third of the three million children living
with HIV today are receiving medicines. The donation program is part of our longstanding commitment to help people
living with HIV and enhance access to our medicines for those in need.
• We made progress reformulating our iconic baby products in response to the changing expectations of our customers.
Following conversations with parents, advocacy groups and retailers, the Johnson & Johnson Family of Consumer
Companies made a public pledge in 2011 to reduce or eliminate certain ingredients in our baby and beauty products
worldwide. We want our beauty and baby care products to reflect our customers’ current expectations, shifting behaviors
and concerns when it comes to certain ingredients, and we are proud to be the first major company to set and meet this
type of a public commitment. We will also continue to lead by working with our suppliers and partners to produce the
very best products for families as we work to meet our commitment to make further enhancements to our products by the
end of 2015. You can learn more about our safety and care commitment at http://www.safetyandcarecommitment.com/.
• We set a new standard for data transparency. In early 2014, Johnson & Johnson announced, through its subsidiary

OUR COMMITMENT TO YOU
Today—and every day—our people and products will touch more than one out of every seven people globally. Our Credo
compels us to act on the potential we have for reaching more people, in more places, and in more ways, as the largest, most broadly-
based health care company in the world.
I have been privileged to work at Johnson & Johnson for more than two decades, and have seen up close the passion, persistence,
creativity, and innovation of our people. I have seen that a commitment to doing the right thing and a commitment to leading by
example are qualities found in abundance at Johnson & Johnson.
In a world challenged by a growing number of diseases, aging populations, insufficient health care delivery and rising costs, our
role to lead—to provide solutions and continue our quest to better serve the individuals, families, communities, countries and
shareholders that depend on us—is as important and urgent today as ever.
Around the world we are doing extraordinary work to meet unmet needs by delivering life-saving medicine and devices, and
forging new frontiers in the call for more personalized engagement in the world of consumer products.
By bringing the values embodied in Our Credo to our work, focusing on near-term priorities and long-term drivers of growth,
we continue to set our sights on even greater health care progress in the years to come.
At Johnson & Johnson, we will continue to approach the future boldly and actively seek out new solutions that advance health,
wellness and improve the quality of people’s lives. I’m so proud to be part of this organization and so excited about our potential in
the years to come.
Sincerely,
Alex Gorsky

Letter to our shareholders
Fellow shareholders,
Recent years have been characterised by a whole host of 
events, ranging from the dramatic to the unprecedented. As 
one would expect, headlines have tended to focus on the 
disruptive, the shocking and the negative. The reality is more 
balanced. Of course there are new challenges, but there are 
also new opportunities. What is different today is the speed 
and unpredictability of change, whether new challenges or 
new opportunities. We think of this as the New Reality.  
The New Reality is characterised by political upheavals, 
economic uncertainty, lacklustre growth in developed 
markets, high levels of volatility in commodity, currency  
and stock markets… but also by dynamic growth in 
emerging markets, increasing affluence, step changes  
in technology and digital communication, new markets  
and new ways to reach consumers and, indeed, by 
increasing numbers of consumers.
More today than ever, if companies are to succeed, they 
need to understand the changing context in which they are 
operating. This context can be very different in different 
parts of the world, which we believe gives decentralised 
organisations such as ours a competitive edge. Companies 
also need a concise strategy, firm values and aligned 
principles. Together, these create a framework that enables 
them to be accountable, aligned, fast and entrepreneurial 
wherever they operate. Nestlé has this framework in the 
form of its strategic roadmap, which we have discussed 
with you over the last few years. We have highlighted some 
aspects of the roadmap later in this report.
Regardless of the shorter term challenges that a company 
faces every year, a core value at Nestlé is to deliver short 
term performance whilst remaining focused on the longer 
term. This was encapsulated in 2011 by our delivery of the 
Nestlé Model of financial performance whilst also investing 
in longer-term growth platforms. Strategic initiatives 
included the creation of Nestlé Health Science, two major 
partnerships in China, and significant investments in Russia, 
India and many African and Latin American countries. 
Also, we have continued to invest in Western Europe and 
North America for increased capacity to support winning 
innovations in categories such as PetCare, Soluble coffee 
and Culinary.
Nestlé Health Science began operations on 1 January 2011  
as a separate company within Nestlé to pioneer a new 
market between food and pharmaceuticals. It is aiming to 
develop science-based personalised nutrition solutions 
to chronic medical conditions. Alongside Nestlé Health 
Science, we have created the Nestlé Institute of Health 
Sciences, headquartered at the Swiss Federal Institute of 
Technology (EPFL) in Lausanne, to spearhead biomedical 
research into health and disease as influenced by genetics, 
metabolism and environment, with the goal of translating 
this knowledge into personalised science-based nutrition.
In only its first year Nestlé Health Science, with 
annualised sales close to CHF 2 billion, has already made 
three investments. The first, the acquisition of Prometheus 
Laboratories Inc., took it into diagnostics and the therapeutic 
gastrointestinal and oncology business. The others were 
products targeting specific disorders and diseases.
One responsibility of leadership is to be a pioneer. It 
is our intention that through the creation of these two 
organisations we can contribute to addressing the global 
issues around chronic diseases and spiralling healthcare 
costs from the perspective of nutritional science and 
personalised nutritional solutions.
Following the creation of Nestlé Health Science, the 
Nestlé approach to Nutrition, Health and Wellness can be 
summarised as having three elements: to pioneer ways 
to address critical illness through personalised nutritional 
solutions (Nestlé Health Science), to address consumers’ 
specific nutritional needs (through Nestlé Nutrition) and to 
offer consumers healthier and tastier choices throughout the 
day (through the rest of our Food and Beverages business). 
Our aim is to enhance the quality of consumers’ lives, and 
these three elements enable us to do so throughout their 
lives, from morning to night.
The emerging markets are populated by billions of people 
who share the objective of living better lives. This is an 
incredibly dynamic catalyst for growth and development, 
both individually for people and collectively for the countries 
where they live. We have a deep rooted presence and about 
40% of our sales in emerging markets. We want not just 
to exploit our own capabilities to share in the development 
of these countries, but also to become a truly local player 
by learning from local capabilities and participating in local 
culinary and nutritional traditions.
In China, for example, we signed two partnerships, 
acquiring 60% of both Hsu Fu Chi and Yinlu. Including 
these businesses, we would have had about CHF 4.5 billion 
of sales in China in 2011. Both businesses have strong 
brands that are part of the Chinese landscape. Hsu Fu Chi

makes sugar confectionery, packaged snacks and sachima, 
a traditional Chinese snack. Its products are tailored to 
Chinese consumers’ needs and habits. Yinlu’s products are 
also a traditional part of the local diet, including ready-to-
drink peanut milk and ready-to-eat canned rice porridge. 
Both companies’ products are a good fit with Nestlé’s 
portfolio in China, and Hsu Fu Chi brings a well-established 
and wide-spread distribution network, whilst Yinlu is a 
co-packer of Nescafé ready-to-drink coffee. 
We also made some smaller acquisitions in Latin 
America and Eastern Europe, and we stepped up our capital 
investment in emerging markets to support our double-digit 
organic growth in these markets. This included investments 
in Chocolate in China and India, Culinary in India, China 
and Africa, Milk and Infant Nutrition in Indonesia, Coffee in 
Africa, Russia and Thailand, Breakfast cereals in Malaysia 
and Turkey and PetCare in Russia and Hungary. 
Our emerging market investment extends beyond our 
own capacities and capabilities upstream to our suppliers. 
Examples in 2011 included technical support and training 
for coffee, cocoa and milk farmers, amongst others, and 
providing about USD 25 million of direct financial assistance 
to farmers.
We recognise that if we are going to build businesses that 
are successful today and sustainable tomorrow, we need to 
invest upstream and down to create value for our partners. 
We need also to contribute more broadly to the societies 
where we operate, which we are doing through a number 
of initiatives ranging from sourcing healthy drinking water 
in rural areas in Africa and Asia to supporting educational 
programmes for children in Eastern Europe, Asia and Africa. 
We are also partnering with the Fair Labor Association, a 
non-profit multi-stakeholder initiative, to investigate whether 
children are working on cocoa farms supplying our factories, 
so we can address any issues effectively and transparently.
This commitment to Creating Shared Value, our belief 
that we can only be successful over time if we create value 
not just for the Company but also for society at large in 
everything we do, and our principle-based approach to 
running our business sustainably are integral to our strategic 
roadmap discussed in this report. Our commitment stands 
front-and-centre as we pursue our objective of being 
the reference for financial performance in our industry. 
Your Company has received external recognition for its 
efforts in this area, being included in both the Dow Jones 
Sustainability Index and The FTSE4Good Index, and 
“We recognise that if we are going to build 
businesses that are successful today  
and sustainable tomorrow, we need to invest 
upstream and down to create value for  
our partners.”

Chief Executive Officer
receiving the Stockholm Industry Water Award and the 
World Environmental Center Gold Medal.
Of course, much of the world’s wealth resides  
in developed markets, and we continued to invest there,  
in Coffee, Infant Nutrition and PetCare amongst others,  
in support of the growth and innovation that we are  
driving in these markets.
Our growth in developed markets, as well as in 
emerging, was a key contributor to us being able to deliver 
organic growth of 7.5%, whilst the strong performance in 
Europe helped your Company achieve a 60 basis points 
improvement in its trading operating profit margin to 15.0% 
of sales. The strength of the Swiss franc had a big impact on 
our reported numbers, but our strong business performance 
enabled us to deliver sales of CHF 83.6 billion and a 
trading operating profit of CHF 12.5 billion. The Group’s net 
profit was CHF 9.5 billion and its underlying earnings per 
share were CHF 3.08 up 7.8% in constant currencies. The 
operating cash flow was CHF 9.8 billion. In view of our 2011 
performance and your Company’s strong financial position, 
your Board is recommending a dividend per share of  
CHF 1.95, an increase of 5.4% over last year’s.

During 2011, priorities for your Board included the 
partnerships and investments discussed above, as well as 
reviewing your Company’s performance, investments and 
financial situation, its compliance and risk management, and 
the implications of the economic environment, particularly 
in Europe. One significant decision was not to announce a 
new share buy-back in 2011 on completion of the programme 
launched in 2010. This decision reflects our desire to have 
a balance sheet that both retains appropriate flexibility for 
our needs and represents a competitive advantage in the 
current economic environment. Another significant decision 
implemented in 2011 was the change of our sales recognition 
policy. This change improved transparency of performance 
with our peers through increased comparability of some 
financial performance indicators. 
There were changes to the Executive Board in 2011.  
Frits van Dijk, Head of Zone Asia, Oceania and Africa, retired 
and was replaced by Nandu Nandkishore. Nandu’s position 
as Head of Nestlé Nutrition was taken by Kurt Schmidt, 
who had been running our North American Infant Nutrition 
business. Petraea Heynike, in charge of Strategic Business 
Units, Marketing & Sales and Nespresso, retired and was 
replaced by Patrice Bula, who was previously Market Head 
of Greater China Region. Luis Cantarell left the Executive 
Board to lead Nestlé Health Science and was replaced as 
Head of Zone Americas by Chris Johnson, who rejoined the 
Executive Board from his position running the Japanese 
market. Also, we announced that Ms Wan Ling Martello will 
take over from James (Jim) Singh as Chief Financial Officer 
on his retirement at the end of March 2012. Wan Ling has a 
career that spans food manufacturing and retailing, as  
well as e-commerce, and is the ideal successor to Jim. 
The Board offers its thanks to Frits and Jim for their many 
decades of service to your Company.
There will be a new member of the Board of Directors 
proposed to shareholders at the 2012 Annual General 
Meeting. Mr. Henri de Castries is the Chairman and Chief 
Executive Officer of the AXA Group, a global leader in 
insurance. He had a distinguished career in the French 
Finance Ministry before taking on several important 
executive roles and responsibilities within the AXA Group. 
We believe his long business experience and strong financial 
background will enrich the Board’s business and financial 
capabilities. Carolina Müller-Möhl and Jean-René Fourtou 
are both retiring from the Board. We thank both for their 
valuable contribution over the past years.
Last year was another in a series of years that will be 
remembered for a range of extraordinary events. From 
the earthquakes and tsunami in Japan through the Arab 
Spring and conflict in Côte d’Ivoire to floods in Thailand and 
Indonesia, there have been a range of extreme challenges 
for our people all over the world. We are greatly appreciative 
of their efforts and thank them on behalf of the Board 
and all our shareholders for their continuous efforts and 
commitment, and their unstinting enthusiasm. 
In view of continuing economic uncertainties and 
volatility, we don’t expect 2012 to be any easier than 
previous years. But we continue to invest for the future 
and strengthen our capabilities across the world.  Our 
innovation is creating opportunities in all categories, 
bringing new consumers to our brands in emerging 
markets, building on our consumers’ engagement with 
our brands in the developed world. Our people are aligned 
behind our strategic roadmap, which is as relevant as 
ever, to drive sustainable performance improvement. We 
are therefore well positioned in 2012 to deliver the Nestlé 
Model of organic growth between 5% and 6%, as well as 
an improvement in the trading operating profit margin and 
underlying earnings per share in constant currencies.

While the Chairman and the Board 
play a critical role in maintaining 
good governance, institutional 
investors play a key role as well. We 
pursue initiatives to further improve 
the dialogue with our Board and to 
facilitate the exercise of voting rights. 
However, as it is only the Board that 
has a fiduciary duty to ensure the 
long-term success of our Company, 
we have set clear expectations in our 
Articles of Association, where we have 
committed ourselves to aim for long-
term, sustainable value creation.
2011 was marked by a number of 
external governance developments, 
including the publication of the 
European Commission’s green paper 
and implementation of the U.K. 
Stewardship Code, the advancement 
of say on pay votes, proxy access 
proposals and increased shareholder 
activism, additional focus on the role 
of proxy advisors and societal changes 
including the advancement of social 
networking. Through shareholder 
surveys, investor roundtables, 
engagement calls and bilateral 
meetings, we have established a 
dialogue with our investors, pursuing 
a holistic approach that manages 
both their financial and governance 
expectations. In our home country, 
we are actively engaged in the 
development of Swiss law and best 
practices for corporate governance and 
the proper functioning of the voting 
chain for issuers and investors alike. 
Our investor base is well diversified 
and reflected on this page.
Corporate Governance
The tone of good governance is set 
by the Board and filters down through 
our organisation. The Chairman and 
the CEO enshrine the principles of 
governance both at Board level and 
below. While our Nestlé Corporate 
Business Principles describe what 
we stand for as a company and the 
high standards we set for ourselves, 
our Board regulations and related 
documents outline our organisational 
and governance principles. 
In our Corporate Governance Report 
we outline how these principles  
ensure the effectiveness of our Board. 
It explains the role of our Board and  
its committees, director nomination 
and introduction processes, Board 
evaluations and risk oversight in line 
with established best practices. 
Environmental, social and sustainability 
issues are the subject of our Creating 
Shared Value Report taking a  
broader perspective on the Board’s 
responsibility. Our Compensation 
Report describes our compensation 
system. We regularly submit it  
to a separate advisory vote of  
our shareholders. 
Additional disclosure of non-
financial performance measures along 
the lines of the UN Global Compact 
Principles for Responsible Investment 
(UNPRI) help us align our operations 
with these universally accepted 
principles. The Global Reporting 
Initiative (GRI) plays a critical role in 
demonstrating our commitments on 
governance, environmental, social, 
ethical and sustainability issues. 
Through our human rights and labour 
practices and our partnership with 
the Danish Institute for Human Rights 
we implement our human rights 
responsibilities globally.

Compliance
Compliance builds trust. It forms the 
base of how we do business and is the 
foundation on which we engage with 
the external world. While responsibility 
is assigned to the markets as per 
our Custodian Concept, a dedicated 
corporate Compliance function 
and a cross-functional Compliance 
Committee define the framework, 
facilitate the coordination between 
the relevant support functions and 
provide guidance and best practices. 
Our Corporate Compliance Programme 
builds awareness and ensures a 
coordinated, holistic and principles-
based approach to compliance and  
risk management.
The continued implementation of 
our Corporate Business Principles, 
as well as our Management and 
Leadership Principles, our Code of 
Business Conduct, our Supplier Code 
and other policies is the cornerstone 
of our cross- functional Corporate 
Compliance Programme. The right 
commitment and tone at the top foster 
a strong, principles-based compliance 
culture. Regular compliance risk 
assessments help us identify areas of 
concern and develop compliance tools 
and best practices related thereto. 
Compliance is regularly monitored 
by our corporate functions, internal 
and external audit and through our 
CARE programme relying on an 
independent external audit network. 
In our performance evaluations 
compliance is linked to “how” goals 
were accomplished.
Our anti-bribery programme is 
based on a global risk assessment 
and includes a globally run anti-
bribery training campaign. Our new 
integrity reporting system includes the 
global roll-out of a “hot-line” to deal 
Nestlé Annual Report 2011
with compliance related grievances, 
complementing the “whistleblower 
procedure” introduced with our Code of 
Business Conduct and our confidential 
reporting system for complaints 
related to the WHO Code. Our anti-
fraud programme provides a common 
framework for fraud related issues.
We use our Nestlé Continuous 
Excellence (NCE) programme to  
further align our risk based approach  
to compliance, providing common 
elements of compliance to be 
considered by all internal gatekeepers. 
They include verification of appropriate 
principles and policies, adequate 
internal controls, effective structures, 
monitoring and reporting, proper 
consequence management and  
above all the right culture and top  
level commitment. Our Group 
Compliance Committee also serves  
as the steering committee for our 
Governance, Risk and Compliance 
(GRC) initiative that aims to further 
integrate the approaches taken in  
the relevant functions under the 
common framework provided by  
Group Compliance.
Since the adoption of the WHO 
Code, we have implemented a global 
programme to ensure compliance 
across all operations involved in the 
marketing of infant nutrition products. 
We adhere to the decisions of all 
governments regarding the application 
of the WHO Code in their countries 
and voluntarily apply the entire WHO 
Code in all developing countries. Our 
Code Compliance Committee provides 
guidance in this area and our inclusion 
in 2011 in the FTSE4Good Index is a 
testimony to our commitment.
We also recognise the UN 
Framework on Business and Human 
Rights. Our human rights due diligence 
programme includes risk assessments, 
impact evaluation, training and 
monitoring. It is coordinated by our 
Human Rights Working Group and 
further strengthens our compliance 
with our Corporate Business Principles 
and our FTSE4Good commitments. 
Good compliance helps us earn 
trust with our employees, investors, 
governments, NGOs and other 
stakeholders, but also our customers 
and consumers. It allows us to credibly 
engage with external organisations. 
For example, we are a founding 
member of the UN Global Compact 
LEAD initiative and the CEO Water 
Mandate, we participate in several 
UNGC Working Groups, we are in a 
regular dialogue with the International 
Labour Organization (ILO) and are 
engaged in a global partnership with 
the International Federation of the Red 
Cross and Red Crescent Societies. 
Throughout this publication we 
present examples of our approach. 
Beyond compliance, how we do 
business is based on sustainability – 
ensuring that our activities preserve our 
business as well as our environment 
for future generations. We will not 
sacrifice our principles and values for 
short-term success. We believe that 
to build a profitable business, we must 
create long-term value for both society 
and for our shareholders. This is what 
we mean by Creating Shared Value.

The Nestlé Roadmap to
Good Food, Good Life
In recent years the Nestlé 
4x4x4 Roadmap has helped 
us build both a very strong 
alignment within our 
Company and a deep 
understanding of what we 
want to achieve and how  
we want to go about it.  
Our people are now better 
able than ever to achieve  
our ambition to be the 
recognised and trusted 
leader in Nutrition, Health 
and Wellness, as well  
as to deliver our financial 
objectives. 
We enhance lives by offering 
tastier and healthier food  
and beverage choices for all 
stages of life and at any time 
of the day. True to our  
values and principles, we also 
enhance lives by Creating 
Shared Value through 
sustainable growth, and  
our commitment to 
environmental sustainability 
and compliance along every 
step of the value chain. 
Our commitment is  
to provide Good Food,  
Good Life.

Nestlé’s product and brand portfolio 
ranges from global icons to local 
favourites. It is supported by an 
unmatched research and development 
capability, with clear priorities, focused 
on driving innovation and renovation 
that is relevant and attractive for 
consumers. Our Company has an

due to the number of countries where 
we are present, but also due to the 
depth of our roots in those countries. 
We have operated in most of our 
locations for generations. This has 
created strong relationships between 
our brands and their consumers as 
well as an unrivalled understanding 
of consumers. This enables us to 
anticipate their needs and improve 
the quality of their lives. Our people, 
culture, values and attitude are our 
greatest strength. The Nestlé culture 
binds our people together all over the 
world with a shared set of behaviours 
and values into a single way of doing 
business. Our culture combines a 
long-term mindset with short-term 
action. It encompasses a passion for 
quality – in products, in relationships, 
in everything we do. It is focused on 
competitiveness, calculated risk-taking 
and an unswerving determination to 
deliver our goals, while creating value 
for society as a whole. 
A Nutrition, Health and Wellness 
mindset means offering tastier and 
healthier choices in all our categories to 
consumers throughout the day. But we 
are also addressing specific nutritional 
needs through Nestlé Nutrition and are 
pioneering ways to use nutrition to 
address critical illness through Nestlé 
Health Science. The trust that 
consumers place in Nestlé is reflected 
in the hundreds of millions of purchase 
decisions that they make every  
day when they choose Nestlé  
products. Many consumers with  
lower incomes are consuming our 
Popularly Positioned Products (PPP), 
mainly in emerging markets. We bring 
the same nutritional know-how  
to these consumers, the same brand 
promise and quality, and we strive  
to add the extra plus – such as 
fortification targeted to specific 
nutritional deficiencies. With premium 
products, consumers look to us to give 
them an affordable, indulgent moment 
of pleasure, an everyday reward. Our 
premiumisation strategy, incorporating 
systems and services, as well as 
premium products, is enhancing 
consumers’ lives, whilst creating 
additional value per consumption 
moment: many consumers are not 
looking to eat and drink more; they are 
looking to eat and drink better. The 
fourth of our growth drivers is out-of-
home consumption, a fast growing part 
of our industry. This covers leisure, 
from roadside kiosks in Asia to 
gourmet restaurants in the capitals of 
the world, and institutional catering, 
from schools to hospitals. Our focus is 
on added-value branded food and 
beverage solutions and services.

dear Fellow  
stakeholders,
this was one of the most important years in nvIdIa’s history. 
while extending our leadership in computer graphics, we 
expanded our reach and began realizing our vision to help 
revolutionize the computer industry.
Foreseeing the importance of energy efficiency,  
we set out half a decade ago to build high-end 
parallel and mobile processors. These ground-
breaking initiatives sought to address two of our 
fundamental convictions: that power will limit the 
number of computers in large data centers, and 
that energy efficiency will define our experience 
with mobile devices.
These beliefs turned out to be well placed. And, 
with both products on the market, we began to 
achieve major wins. 
Results in the fourth quarter provided a glimpse  
of their potential. Net profit more than doubled  
to $172 million from the previous quarter, and 
gross margin hit a record 48.1 percent. For the full 
year, net profit totaled $253 million, from 2010’s 
$68 million loss, as revenue rose 6.5 percent to 
$3.54 billion.
In many respects, the fourth quarter marked the 
beginning of a new NVIDIA. Our coming-out party 
was this year’s International Consumer Electronics 
Show, where major news was announced:
  OEMs announced a range of super phones  
incorporating the NVIDIA Tegra 2 mobile super 
chip, making it the show’s runaway hit.
  We unveiled Project Denver, a secret NVIDIA-built 
custom CPU based on ultra energy-efficient ARM 
architecture. 
  Microsoft underscored Project Denver’s  
importance, disclosing that the next generation  
of Windows will, for the first time, run on ARM 
architecture.
And less than a week later, NVIDIA entered into a 
significant cross-licensing agreement with Intel. 
This provides us with access to all of Intel’s 
technologies to build our own processors, as well 
as $1.5 billion in licensing payments over six years.

a new comPUTinG revolUTion
After a 30-year run with the PC at the center of 
innovation, the computer industry is being rocked 
by dramatic changes. 
In this new world, PCs will remain the main 
platform for creative expression. But the devices 
most central to our lives will be super phones and 
tablets. They will be our most personal computers.
Just as the PC revolution once transformed the 
computer industry, the mobile computing revolu-
tion will have equally far-reaching impact.
Consider….These handheld computers are created 
by phone companies, not traditional OEMs. We buy 
them from carriers—not just retailers. We use them 
to enjoy books, games, music, and apps downloaded 
from a digital store—not shrink-wrapped software. 
And their architecture is based on processors like 
Tegra, which are entire computers on a thumbnail-
size chip incorporating ARM CPUs, not x86-com-
patible CPUs.
Nearly everything about these devices is different, 
including the way we will use them. 
In the future, you’ll be able to hold up your phone to 
a Chinese menu and see it instantly translated into 
a chosen language. You may be able to use it to 
take your pulse, gauge your blood pressure, and 
perhaps even measure blood-sugar levels.
You’ll be able to use your tablet’s video camera  
to view your living room. Magically, a computer-
generated 3D image of the coffee table you are 
thinking about buying will appear in the room. You 
will be able to wander, and by looking through the 
tablet, view the table from varying angles. 
 Jen-Hsun Huang – co-founder, president and chief executive officer
This and so much more will be possible. But 
delivering on the full promise of mobile computing 
will require a new class of processor—one that 
provides supercomputing capabilities yet sips tiny 
amounts of power. 
We believe the most energy-efficient architecture 
for this challenge is a GPU. It works in parallel, 
breaking down a large challenge into small tasks 
that can be handled simultaneously by hundreds  
of tiny processors.
a cUlTUre of reinvenTion
Realizing the potential of mobile computing plays 
to NVIDIA’s strengths. And we have demonstrated 
our adaptability to seize new opportunities by 
repeatedly reinventing ourselves. 
Back in 1993, we launched our three-man startup  
to revolutionize PC graphics, believing that the  
PC would become a consumer device for enjoying 
games and multimedia. This, in time, became a 
massive industry, leading us to $1 billion in revenue 
faster than any semiconductor company in history. 
In the early 2000s, we invented the programmable 
graphics processor, giving software developers  
an infinitely flexible palette for expressing their 
artistic vision. This expanded our reach into using 
computer graphics for creating movies, revealing 
3D medical images and styling cars. We became  
a GPU company, ultimately reaching $4 billion  
in revenue.

 nvidia’s tegra Zone app provides a curated collection of the 
best android games for tegra-powered devices.
NVIDIA’s latest reinvention is based on energy-
efficient high-performance processors that are 
100-times more energy efficient than a PC. This 
opens a new, massive growth opportunity for us. 
Within just a few years, 2.5 billion phones will  
be sold annually, each a mobile computer. Our 
opportunity will, thus, increase sixfold, to a total 
addressable market of some $30 billion.
TeGra sUPer chiPs
Already, today’s market for super phones is 
growing exponentially. The device’s ability to deliver 
high-definition video chat, console-quality multi-
player gaming and Web browsing is capturing many 
millions of customers each month. 
Tegra, which has earned a reputation as the most 
advanced processor of its kind, was the first to 
bring dual-core CPUs to mobile devices. 
We have design wins with a large number of 
partners. Some are long-time collaborators, such 
as Acer, ASUS, Dell and Toshiba. Others are first-
time partners in new industries that we are now 
able to serve, such as LG, Motorola and Samsung. 
Although relatively new to the mobile field, we  
have key capabilities that matter greatly as the 
mobile industry converges with the computer 
industry. Among them: our deep expertise in 
computing and graphics; our fast, precise product-
execution cycle times honed from years of building 
advanced technologies for PCs; and our extensive 
intellectual property. 
12
At the recent Mobile World Congress, in Barcelona, 
we unveiled our roadmap for future generations  
of the Tegra chip. With the cadence of a new 
processor every year, we expect to see a fivefold 
improvement in performance in the next genera-
tion version due out later this year, and a 75-fold 
increase in five years. 
sTrenGTh in core markeTs 
Even as we were reinventing NVIDIA and expanding 
our growth opportunities this year, we extended 
our leadership in visual computing.
The GeForce brand has long been the top choice  
for gamers, and with the GTX 500 NVIDIA Fermi 
generation of GPUs, we continue to lead the 
industry. This line offers exceptional speed, a 
revolutionary new GPU capability called tessella-
tion, and further advances in immersive gameplay. 
Its flagship, the GTX 580, is widely regarded by 
enthusiasts and reviewers as the world’s fastest, 
most advanced GPU. 
GeForce’s promise is to delight gamers. And that 
starts with great games. The fastest-growing 
genre in PC gaming is massively multiplayer online 
games, or MMO, and its most popular title is World 
of Warcraft, with more than 12 million players 
worldwide. This year, its creator, Blizzard, released 
two highly anticipated PC games: StarCraft 2 and 
World of Warcraft Cataclysm. 
StarCraft 2 sold more than a million copies in its 
first 24 hours, making it the fastest-selling real-
time strategy game ever. And World of Warcraft: 

--- Page 15 ---
Cataclysm sold 3.3 million units in its first day, 
making it the fastest-selling PC game ever. 
Franchises like Starcraft and World of Warcraft 
illustrate the vibrancy of GeForce’s market. 
Another illustration is that we recently celebrated 
shipment of our one-billionth GeForce GPU with 
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company 
Ltd., a partner that has been critical to our success.
Beyond building the most advanced GPUs, we 
continued to create technologies that bring new 
experiences to PC gamers. 3D Vision, the world’s 
best stereoscopic 3D experience, immerses them 
fully in a virtual world. Just two years after its 
introduction, 3D Vision is now supported by more 
than 1,000 individual products from dozens of 
suppliers, including games, projectors, TVs, 
cameras, and desktop and laptop screens. We  
also launched 3DVisionLive.com, an online 
community where users can share 3D content.
In an emerging trend, PCs are pulling away from 
consoles as the platform of choice for serious 
gamers, accelerated by unique features like 
tessellation, 3D Vision and the use of multiple  
3D screens at once.
Even as the GeForce GPU continues to lead the 
market, our Quadro brand remains the industry 
standard for graphics professionals. They use 
workstations to speed work in product design, 
visual effects for film production, video editing and 
advanced visualization.
For the second consecutive year, every film 
nominated for an Oscar in the Best Visual Effects 
category featured magic made possible by Quadro. 
The international virtual space expedition to Mars 
is harnessing the power of Quadro systems to 
simulate a 520-day manned flight. And Quadro 
enabled Glassworks in the UK, together with 
University College London Hospitals, to create a 
computer-generated heart model that beats in real 
time, showing changes in the heart’s shape during 
the cardiac cycle. Physicians can now study the 
beating heart in ways never before possible.
Another breakthrough for us this year was the 
introduction of computational visualization, which 
promises to revolutionize computer graphics,  
just as our programmable shading once did. 
Fermi-generation GPUs can rapidly generate a 
photorealistic image that simulates the path of 
light and material properties in a particular 
environment—a process called ray tracing. By 
accomplishing this at a rate of several images a 
second, rather than an image every several hours, 
Quadro processors transform how designers and 
artists enhance their digital creations.
 tesselation provides a nearly infinite level of detail to what had been coarse 3d 
models. in the unigine Heaven benchmark, shown above, a mythical village is 
brought to life with volumetric clouds and advanced compute shaders.

papers increased fivefold. Prominent scientists 
delivered talks on such diverse fields as self-driven 
cars; computational photography that enables 
changes to be made in focus, depth of field and 
lighting on already-captured images; and compu-
tational finance applied to stock-options pricing.
The adoption of our Tesla processors by top 
supercomputing centers indicates the importance 
of GPUs in the future of high-performance technical 
computing. By adding GPUs to CPU clusters, 
standard enterprise servers can be transformed 
into supercomputing servers. 
This new architecture has wide appeal. Standard 
CPU clusters can serve the email and database 
needs for a multinational’s employees. And 
specialized CPU/GPU clusters can be used by  
the company’s engineers and researchers for 
product development. With CUDA GPU computing, 
we have made it possible for supercomputers to 
achieve performance levels never before possible, 
while keeping them widely affordable.
One of the most significant achievements of GPU 
computing was news that Tesla processors helped 
power the world’s fastest supercomputer—China’s 
2.5 petaflop Tianhe-1A supercomputer—as well  
as two other systems on the list of the world’s five 
top supercomputers.

acceleraTinG scienTific Discovery 
The growing ambitions of scientists and research-
ers to tackle enormous challenges—modeling  
cell mutation, predicting weather, manipulating 
nanomaterials to create lightweight parts for 
fuel-efficient cars—make processing power  
more important than ever as a tool for discovery. 
Computation has become so fundamental to the 
scientific process that it has come to be called  
the third pillar of science, together with theory  
and experimentation.
To meet this challenge, NVIDIA created a new breed 
of parallel-processing GPUs that work not just with 
the pixels of an image but with numerical data. This 
parallel computing architecture is called CUDA. 
Among its most important applications are in the 
medical field. Researchers at University of Califor-
nia, San Diego’s Radiation Oncology Department 
have shown that GPUs can cut the amount of 
radiation used in CT scans by up to 72 times.  
A team from Harvard and Brigham & Women’s 
Hospital has found a way to create 3D images of a 
patient’s arteries, providing a non-invasive way to 
locate potentially lethal plaque. And researchers in 
Montpellier, France, use GPUs to virtually still a 
beating heart, enabling surgeons to treat patients 
by guiding robotic arms that predict and adjust  
for movement. 
A sign of CUDA’s growing importance was our 
second annual GPU Technology Conference, held in 
San Jose, Calif. Attendance grew 50 percent from 
the previous year and the number of submitted

Commitment to supporting the larger community, 
particularly those areas in which we operate, 
remains central to who we are. 
Last year, the number of our offices where local 
employees participated in a charitable event near 
their offices rose from 12 to 18, and volunteerism 
increased 20 percent. We continued Project Inspire, 
which employees forego an annual holiday party 
and instead participate in a program that benefits 
their local community.
Our flagship initiative in Santa Clara, Calif., drew 
more than 1,000 employees, family members  
and local residents. Over a weekend in mid-
December, we converged on a community center in 
nearby San Jose, with the goals of building garden 
beds for low-income families, constructing a large 
educational greenhouse and making improvements 
to the building and grounds.
Similar efforts occurred elsewhere. In Beijing, 
employees, joined by business partners, continued 
to work with an orphanage that the office “adopted” 
two years ago, donating computer systems and 
supplies. In Pune, India, our employees raised 
funds to build a classroom at a school for visually-
impaired girls. And in Würselen, Germany, 
employees worked side by side with youth to 
improve a vocational training center. 
The NVIDIA Foundation, one of the industry’s only 
employee-led charitable foundations, continued its 
work in the areas of disease prevention, education 
and human services. The Foundation launched a 
strategic initiative called Compute the Cure, an 
effort to combine employees’ interest in health with 
NVIDIA technology, by funding the work of global 
cancer researchers. It will announce its first 
funding project this year. 
I’m pleased to note that we also completed our first 
global citizenship report this year, in which we set 
out the measures we’re taking, and our goals, for 
ensuring sustainability.

NVIDIA has spent the past five years investing  
and planning for the rise of mobile and parallel 
computing. It’s thrilling to see these defining the 
new computer industry. 
We have enormous work ahead of us to realize our 
vision. But I believe we are better situated than any 
company to thrive in this new environment. And I 
have never been more excited about our prospects.

Letter  
to Shareholders
Dear Fellow Shareholders,
In 2019, Citi delivered our most 
profitable year since 2006.  
The $19.4 billion we earned  
on $74.3 billion in revenues  
was $1.4 billion higher than in 
2018. Our earnings per share  
of $8.04 were up more than 
20% compared with the year 
before. We drove 4% underlying 
revenue growth across our 
Consumer and Institutional 
franchises.1 We have grown 
loans and deposits for  
16 consecutive quarters.
We continued to make progress 
toward the financial targets we have 
laid out. We are on a path to return 
approximately $62 billion of capital 
to our shareholders, exceeding our 
commitment. To date, we have returned 
approximately $53 billion, including a 
portion of the roughly $22 billion we 
gained regulatory approval to return 
over the 2019 Comprehensive Capital 
Analysis and Review cycle. Most 
importantly, we closed out 2019 on a 
high note, with a Return on Tangible 
Common Equity of 12.1%, just above our 
12% target and 120 basis points higher 
than in 2018.2
These results reflect how well our 
model can perform, even in an 
uncertain environment. Coming out 
of a tough fourth quarter of 2018 
for the markets and our industry, 
2
we entered 2019 amid widespread 
predictions of a global recession and 
potential turn of the business cycle. 
Against that backdrop, the growth 
we drove came — as we said it would 
— from working collaboratively and 
creatively with clients to manage 
and grow their businesses in an 
increasingly complex environment 
characterized by trade routes shifting 
and supply chains realigning. We 
again proved the value of our global 
client network and unmatched ability 
to connect people and businesses to 
opportunities worldwide. 
The year concluded with several 
economic storm clouds lifting. The U.S. 
and China signed a Phase 1 trade deal, 
the new United States-Mexico-Canada 
Agreement was ratified and Brexit was

at last confirmed. At Citi, we emerged 
in a strong competitive position in 
terms of capital, liquidity, technology 
and, importantly, talent. Changes to 
my management team include a new 
President of Citi and CEO of Global 
Consumer Banking, Jane Fraser; a new 
CEO of our Institutional Clients Group, 
Paco Ybarra; a new CFO, Mark Mason; 
and new heads of our three regions. 
Our positive position across all of 
those areas permitted us to realize the 
benefits of investments we have made 
over the past several years in high-
growth, high-return areas across the 
franchise. We also continued to invest 
in our infrastructure and culture of 
compliance and controls, in light of the 
enduring need to be an indisputably 
strong and stable institution.

--- Page 5 ---
In our Global Consumer Bank, we 
sustained momentum by generating 
4% annual underlying revenue 
growth with contributions from all 
three regions: the U.S., Mexico and 
Asia.3 Since establishing a client-
centric structure in our largest 
Consumer market, the U.S., our 
strategy of unifying Branded Cards 
and Retail Banking has yielded a 
steady stream of compelling new 
products and value propositions, 
from digital lending to flexible 
payments. We are targeting a 
significant opportunity to redefine 
scale not according to the traditional 
metrics of assets and footprint but 
with digitally driven experiences. 
The strong revenue growth we saw in 
Branded Cards and $6 billion in U.S. 
digital deposit sales — five times that 
of the previous year — are signs that 
our integrated client-centric strategy 
is working. Two-thirds of our digital 
deposit sales came from outside our 
physical footprint and half came from 
our card customers with no prior 
retail banking relationship with us. 
We also expanded our relationship 
with American Airlines to offer a 
new savings account designed to 
deepen relationships from cards-only 
customers to multi-relationship clients. 
And we announced a partnership with 
Google to explore launching a new 
checking account on Google Play in 
2020, aimed at expanding the reach 
and breadth of our customer base. 
In Asia, we entered into new credit 
card partnerships with digital leaders 
Grab, Lazada and Indian e-commerce 
juggernaut Paytm. In Mexico, we 
continued to leverage Citibanamex’s 
extraordinary prestige and leading 
market position to deliver double-
digit growth in earnings before taxes 
even in a muted market environment. 
Our Institutional Clients Group turned 
in an equally strong performance, 
driving balanced 4% underlying 
revenue growth across our franchise 
that serves corporate (including 90% 
of Fortune 500 firms), investor and 
government clients and ultra high net 
worth households and individuals.4 
International Financing Review 
summed up the source of our market 
and wallet share gains when it named 
Citi 2019 Bank of the Year: “Citi is a 
truly global — and unique — corporate 
bank that joins the developed and 
developing world.” Those connections 
run deep between our banking teams 
and clients and across products, 
sectors, markets and regions.

Our Markets and Securities Services 
business continues its strong 
performance having topped the 
Greenwich Associates’ Global Fixed 
Income Dealer rankings for the fourth 
consecutive year. Securities Services 
grew deposit balances versus the 
prior year through new mandates and 
organic growth from existing clients. 
Citi Private Bank retained the award 
for the Best Global Private Bank from 
the Financial Times for the second 
year, finishing 2019 with year-over-
year growth across product areas. 
To enhance how we serve midsized 
companies that value our global 
reach, we realigned our organizational 
structure to have Citi Commercial 
Bank report into the Institutional 
Clients Group globally. This new 
alignment leverages the full 
breadth of solutions provided by 
our client network and gives us new 
opportunities to continue to build and 
develop our top talent. 
A year after we aligned our structure to 
create a holistic client coverage model 
in the form of the unified Banking, 
Capital Markets and Advisory (BCMA) 
team, our share rose year-over-year 
across mergers and acquisitions (M&A) 
and equity and debt capital markets. 
Our increased share shows how we 
can deliver a full suite of services to 
clients who rely on us to sustain steady 
transactional flow. BCMA fulfilled its 
mandate by executing on an even 
higher share of the year’s significant 
deals. We were financial advisor to U.S. 
biotech firm Celgene on its $96.8 billion 
merger with Bristol-Myers Squibb, the 
largest-ever healthcare M&A deal. We 
were lead financial advisor to Raytheon 
on its all-stock merger with United 
Technologies’ aerospace unit. We also

are not just best of bank but best 
in life, prompting us to allocate 
substantial resources and mindshare 
to exceeding our clients’ evolving 
expectations of engaging with Citi on 
their channel of choice.
Our strategy to capture the abundant 
opportunities inherent in this trend 
is threefold. First, we partner with 
startups that value our model, global 
client base and brand to test and 
deploy new technologies at scale. 
Second, we invest in firms with 
demonstrable growth potential and 
ability to create solutions that deliver 
real benefits to our firm and clients. 
And third, we develop proprietary 
solutions through our internal D10X 
incubation program and network 
of Innovation Labs. Regardless of 
source, our intent is the same: tapping 
technology to eliminate client pain 
points and frustrations, streamline 
our processes, and deliver holistic, 
integrated products and services to 
customers and clients of all sizes 
and sectors more seamlessly and 
efficiently than peers. That strategy 
is showing results, and Citi’s digital 
leadership has been recognized in 
each region. Citi was named Best 
Digital Bank in Asia by Euromoney, 
principles for responsible firms, I 
found the lively debate that ensued 
healthy and reassuring, but for us 
at Citi, the approach is not new. 
The statement said simply that 
companies should take the interests 
of all stakeholders — including 
shareholders, colleagues, clients, 
suppliers and communities — into 
account when making decisions. 
With every action we take, we 
strive to demonstrate the value we 
contribute and the values we uphold. 
Ultimately, taking stakeholder 
interests into account benefits our 
shareholders. We have been on this 
journey for some time and welcome 
the actions companies are taking 
to hold themselves accountable to 
higher environmental, social and 
governance standards. 
We also see this as a positive 
development because these 
expectations arise from the higher 
levels of trust and credibility 
businesses have built, notably with 
their own people. Research reveals 
that a global majority do not trust 
the media or government to do the 
right thing for them or for society. 
Still, three out of four believe their 
own employer will. As colleagues 
As colleagues and clients want to work 
for, and do business with, companies that 
affirmatively reflect their own priorities 
and principles, more firms intent on 
attracting and retaining top talent are 
rising to the challenge.

our businesses seek out opportunities 
to address challenges that impact our 
clients and communities.

Our government clients around the 
world urgently need infrastructure. 
The G20 has estimated that nearly 
$100 trillion is needed for global 
infrastructure spending by 2040, but 
there is a spending gap of $18 trillion. 
Citi’s Public Finance team is playing its 
part by financing, among other critical 
projects, the two largest airport public-
private partnerships in U.S. history. We 
also financed the construction of new 
subway systems in Panama and Peru, 
helping two fast-growing metropolises 
in dynamic emerging economies reduce 
traffic and carbon emissions.
In the communities we serve, one 
particular infrastructure gap is 
increasingly pressing: affordable 
housing. As urban populations soar and 
cities become less affordable for many, 
what has long been an acute shortage 
is becoming a crisis. In 2019, Citi ranked 
first among U.S. financiers of affordable 
housing for the 10th year in a row. 
We financed over $6 billion worth of 
affordable rental housing projects. In 
partnership with developers, nonprofits 
and governments, our Citi Community 
Capital team has helped to create or 
preserve nearly 500,000 affordable 
units over the past decade.
We have been on the front lines and 
in charge of leading our industry 
with our sustainability strategy since 
joining the United Nations Environment 
Programme Finance Initiative in 
1997 and co-founding the Equator 
Principles in 2003. That is the first 
framework developed by responsible 
financial institutions to assess and 
manage the environmental and social 
risks associated with project finance. 
Flash forward to September 2019 and 
Climate Week in New York: Citi was the 
only U.S. bank to sign on to the United 
Nations’ Principles for Responsible 
Banking, joining a coalition of 130

global financial firms that have agreed 
to align their business practices related 
to climate risks and opportunities with 
the UN’s Sustainable Development 
Goals and the Paris Agreement. 
In 2013, Citi achieved our first  
10-year $50 billion Environmental 
Finance Goal three years early, and in 
2019, we exceeded our second 10-year 
$100 billion Environmental Finance 
Goal four years ahead of schedule. In 
2019, we were a founding signatory of 
the Poseidon Principles, a voluntary 
framework aimed at reducing the 
carbon emissions of maritime 
shipping. We are also on track to 
achieve our goal of sourcing 100% 
renewable electricity across our global 
operations in 2020.
There are few areas where the gap 
between the scale of the need and 
of the progress to date is wider than 
in the field of inclusive finance. With 
the world’s unbanked population 
estimated at 1.7 billion, our Inclusive 
Finance unit has worked with teams 
across our firm over the last decade 
to provide more than 3.3 million 
entrepreneurs, 3 million of them 
women, with access to capital and 
financial services in 34 countries in 
partnership with the U.S. International 
Development Finance Corporation, 
formerly OPIC. The Citibanamex 
Transfer account has attracted over 
10 million customers, 80% formerly 
unbanked. The Citi Foundation’s 
Pathways to Progress program, which 
started in 2014 in 10 cities and went 
global three years later, has helped 
prepare more than 850,000 youth 
for the jobs of today through paid 
internships, mentorship, workforce 
training and leadership development. 
We have invested $140 million in this 
initiative to date and will soon be 
announcing its next stage.
The financial results we reported and 
the positive economic and social impact 
that we and our model have on our 
clients and communities have never 
been more closely connected. The 
Mission and Value Proposition at the 
front of this report describes not just 
what we do but how and why we do 
it. As we prepare to host our second 
Investor Day, in 2020, I have never felt 
better about our financial strength and 
competitive position, as measured by all 
the relevant metrics: revenues, returns, 
income and capital. I have also never 
felt better or more confident about 
who we are, what we stand for, and the 
lasting value of the many things we do 
for our clients, our communities, our 
shareholders, our people and all of our 
stakeholders worldwide. While there is 
no shortage of challenges ahead, I am 
confident in our ability to continue to 
rise and meet them.
Sincerely,

Dear Fellow Shareholders,
Jamie Dimon, 
Chairman and 
Chief Executive 
Officer
Across the globe, 2023 was yet another year of significant challenges, from the 
terrible ongoing wars and violence in the Middle East and Ukraine to mounting 
terrorist activity and growing geopolitical tensions, importantly with China. Almost 
all nations felt the effects last year of global economic uncertainty, including higher 
energy and food prices, inflation rates and volatile markets. While all these events 
and associated instability have serious ramifications on our company, colleagues, 
clients and countries where we do business, their consequences on the world at large 
— with the extreme suffering of the Ukrainian people, escalating tragedy in the Middle 
East and the potential restructuring of the global order — are far more important. 
As these events unfold, America’s global leadership role is being challenged outside 
by other nations and inside by our polarized electorate. We need to find ways to put 
aside our differences and work in partnership with other Western nations in the name 
of democracy. During this time of great crises, uniting to protect our essential 
freedoms, including free enterprise, is paramount. We should remember that 
America, “conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are 
2

--- Page 5 ---
created equal,” still remains a shining beacon of hope to citizens around the world. 
JPMorgan Chase, a company that historically has worked across borders and 
boundaries, will do its part to ensure that the global economy is safe and secure. 
In spite of the unsettling landscape, including last year’s regional bank turmoil, the 
U.S. economy continues to be resilient, with consumers still spending, and the 
markets currently expect a soft landing. It is important to note that the economy is 
being fueled by large amounts of government deficit spending and past stimulus. 
There is also a growing need for increased spending as we continue transitioning to  
a greener economy, restructuring global supply chains, boosting military expenditure 
and battling rising healthcare costs. This may lead to stickier inflation and higher 
rates than markets expect. Furthermore, there are downside risks to watch. 
Quantitative tightening is draining more than $900 billion in liquidity from the system 
annually — and we have never truly experienced the full effect of quantitative 
tightening on this scale. Plus the ongoing wars in Ukraine and the Middle East 
continue to have the potential to disrupt energy and food markets, migration, and 
military and economic relationships, in addition to their dreadful human cost. These 
significant and somewhat unprecedented forces cause us to remain cautious. 
2023 was another strong year for JPMorgan Chase, with our firm generating record 
revenue for the sixth consecutive year, as well as setting numerous records in each  
of our lines of business. We earned revenue in 2023 of $162.4 billion1 and net income 
of $49.6 billion, with return on tangible common equity (ROTCE) of 21%, reflecting 
strong underlying performance across our businesses. We also increased our 
quarterly common dividend of $1.00 per share to $1.05 per share in the third quarter 
of 2023 — and again to $1.15 per share in the first quarter of 2024 — while continuing 
to reinforce our fortress balance sheet. We grew market share in several of our 
businesses and continued to make significant investments in products, people and 
technology while exercising strict risk disciplines. 
Throughout the year, we demonstrated the power of our investment philosophy and 
guiding principles, as well as the value of being there for clients — as we always are — 
in both good times and bad times. The result was continued growth broadly across 
the firm. We will highlight a few examples from 2023: Consumer & Community 
Banking (CCB) extended its #1 leadership positions and grew share year-over-year in 
retail deposits, credit card sales and credit card outstandings (adding close to 3.6 
million net new customers to the franchise); the Corporate & Investment Bank (CIB) 
1   Represents managed revenue.

maintained its #1 rank in both Investment Banking and Markets and gained more 
than 100 basis points of Investment Banking market share; Commercial Banking (CB) 
added over 5,000 new relationships (excluding First Republic Bank), roughly doubling 
the prior year’s achievement; and Asset & Wealth Management (AWM) saw record 
client asset net inflows of $490 billion, over 20% higher than its prior record.
In 2023, we continued to play a forceful and essential role in advancing economic 
growth. In total, we extended credit and raised capital totaling $2.3 trillion for our 
consumer and institutional clients around the world. On a daily basis, we move nearly 
$10 trillion in over 120 currencies and more than 160 countries, as well as safeguard 
over $32 trillion in assets. By purchasing First Republic Bank, we brought much-
needed stability to the U.S. banking system while allowing us to give a new, secure 
home to over half a million First Republic customers.
As always, we hold fast to our commitment to corporate responsibility, including 
helping to create a stronger, more inclusive economy — from supporting work skills 
training programs around the world to financing affordable housing and small 
businesses to making investments in cities like Detroit that show how business and 
government leaders can work together to solve problems. 
We have achieved our decades-long consistency by adhering to our key principles and 
strategies (see sidebar on Steadfast Principles on page 5), which allow us to drive 
good organic growth and promote proper management of our capital (including 
dividends and stock buybacks). The charts on pages 9–15 show our performance 
results and illustrate how we have grown our franchises, how we compare with our 
competitors and how we look at our fortress balance sheet. Please peruse them and 
the CEO letters in this Annual Report, all of which provide specific details about our 
businesses and our plans for the future. 
I remain proud of our company’s resiliency and of what our hundreds of thousands of 
employees around the world have achieved, collectively and individually. Throughout 
these challenging past few years, we have never stopped doing all the things we should 
be doing to serve our clients and our communities. As you know, we are champions of 
banking’s essential role in a community — its potential for bringing people together, for 
enabling companies and individuals to attain their goals, and for being a source of 
strength in difficult times. I often remind our employees that the work we do matters 
4

STEADFAST PRINCIPLES WORTH REPEATING (AND ONE NEW ONE)
Looking back on the past two+ decades — 
starting from my time as Chairman and 
CEO of Bank One in 2000 — there is one 
common theme: our unwavering dedica-
tion to help clients, communities and 
countries throughout the world. It is clear 
that our financial discipline, constant 
investment in innovation and ongoing 
development of our people have enabled 
us to achieve this consistency and com-
mitment. In addition, across the firm, we 
uphold certain steadfast tenets that are 
worth repeating. 
First, our work has very real human 
impact. While JPMorgan Chase stock is 
owned by large institutions, pension 
plans, mutual funds and directly by single 
investors, in almost all cases the ultimate 
beneficiaries are individuals in our com-
munities. More than 100 million people in 
the United States own stocks; many, in 
one way or another, own JPMorgan Chase 
stock. Frequently, these shareholders are 
veterans, teachers, police officers, fire-
fighters, healthcare workers, retirees, or 
those saving for a home, education or 
retirement. Often, our employees also 
bank these shareholders, as well as their 
families and their companies. Your man-
agement team goes to work every day 
recognizing the enormous responsibility 
that we have to all of our shareholders. 
Second, shareholder value can be built 
only if you maintain a healthy and vibrant 
company, which means doing a good job 
of taking care of your customers, employ-
ees and communities. Conversely, how 
can you have a healthy company if you 
neglect any of these stakeholders? As we 
have learned over the past few years, 
there are myriad ways an institution can 
demonstrate its compassion for its 
employees and its communities while still 
strengthening shareholder value.
Third, while we don’t run the company 
worrying about the stock price in the short 
run, in the long run we consider our stock 
price a measure of our progress over time. 
This progress is a function of continual 
investments in our people, systems and 
products, in good and bad times, to build 
our capabilities. These important invest-
ments will also drive our company’s future 
prospects and position it to grow and 
prosper for decades. Measured by stock 
performance, our progress is exceptional. 
For example, whether looking back 10 
years or even farther to 2004, when the 
JPMorgan Chase/Bank One merger took 
place, we have outperformed the Standard 
& Poor’s 500 Index and the Standard & 
Poor’s Financials Index. 
Fourth, we are united behind basic princi-
ples and strategies (you can see the prin-
ciples for How We Do Business on our 
website and our Purpose statement in my 
letter from last year) that have helped 
build this company and made it thrive. 
These allow us to maintain a fortress bal-
ance sheet, constantly invest and nurture 
talent, fully satisfy regulators, continually 
improve risk, governance and controls, 
and serve customers and clients while 
lifting up communities worldwide. This 
philosophy is embedded in our company 
culture and influences nearly every role 
in the firm. 
Fifth, we strive to build enduring busi-
nesses, which rely on and benefit from one 
another, but we are not a conglomerate. 
This structure helps generate our superior 
returns. Nonetheless, despite our best 
efforts, the walls that protect this com-
pany are not particularly high — and we 
face extraordinary competition. I have 
written about this reality extensively in the 
past and cover it again in this letter. We 
recognize our strengths and vulnerabili-
ties, and we play our hand as best we can.
Sixth, and this is the new one, we must be 
a source of strength, particularly in tough 
times, for our clients and the countries in 
which we operate. We must take seriously 
our role as one of the guardians of the 
world’s financial systems.
Seventh, we operate with a very important 
silent partner — the U.S. government — 
noting as my friend Warren Buffett points 
out that his company’s success is predi-
cated upon the extraordinary conditions 
our country creates. He is right to say to 
his shareholders that when they see the 
American flag, they all should say thank 
you. We should, too. JPMorgan Chase is a 
healthy and thriving company, and we 
always want to give back and pay our fair 
share. We do pay our fair share — and we 
want it to be spent well and have the 
greatest impact. To give you an idea of 
where our taxes and fees go: In the last 10 
years, we paid more than $46 billion in 
federal, state and local taxes in the United 
States and over $22 billion in taxes outside 
of the United States. Additionally, we paid 
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 
over $10 billion so that it has the resources 
to cover failure in the American banking 
sector. Our partner — the federal govern-
ment — also imposes significant regula-
tions upon us, and it is imperative that we 
meet all legal and regulatory require-
ments imposed on our company. 
Eighth and finally, we know the founda-
tion of our success rests with our people. 
They are the front line, both individually 
and as teams, serving our customers and 
communities, building the technology, 
making the strategic decisions, managing 
the risks, determining our investments 
and driving innovation. However you view 
the world — its complexity, risks and 
opportunities — a company’s prosperity 
requires a great team of people with 
guts, brains, integrity, enormous capabili-
ties and high standards of professional 
excellence to ensure its ongoing success.

and has impact. United by our principles and purpose, we help people and institutions 
finance and achieve their aspirations, lifting up individuals, homeowners, small 
businesses, larger corporations, schools, hospitals, cities and countries in all regions  
of the world. What we have accomplished in the 20 years since the Bank One and 
JPMorgan Chase merger is evidence of the importance of our values.
CELEBRATING THE 20TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE BANK ONE/JPMORGAN CHASE 
MERGER
J.P. Morgan Chase
By 2004, J.P. Morgan Chase already represented the consolidation of four of the 10 
largest U.S. banks from 1990: The Chase Manhattan Corp., Manufacturers Hanover, 
Chemical Banking Corp. and, most recently, J.P. Morgan & Company. And some of their 
predecessor companies stretched back into the 1800s, one even into the late 1700s.
Bank One
Bank One had been even busier on the acquisition front, especially across the United 
States. By 1998, then Banc One had more than 1,300 branches in 12 states when it 
announced a merger with First Chicago NBD, a Chicago-based bank created just  
three years earlier by the merger of First Chicago and Detroit-based NBD. Now 
headquartered in Chicago, the new Bank One became the largest bank in the 
Midwest, second largest among credit card companies and fourth largest in the 
United States. But the merger didn’t go as planned, with Bank One issuing three 
different earnings warnings. In March 2000, Bank One reached outside its executive 
ranks, and my tenure began as Chairman and CEO, working to overhaul the company 
and help bring it back to profitability and growth. 
The story begins ... A merger 20 years ago helped transform two giant banks
Fast forward to 2003, and another wave of consolidation was well underway in U.S. 
banking. Most of the nation’s larger banks were trying to position themselves to be an 
“endgame winner.” In the biggest deal, Bank of America agreed to buy FleetBoston 
Financial Corp. for more than $40 billion. Those two banks — already amalgamations 
of several predecessor companies — touted the breadth of their combined retail 
branch network.
7

--- Page 10 ---
But they were hardly alone. In 2003, some 215 deals were announced among  
U.S. commercial banks and bank holding companies for a total value of $66 billion, 
according to Thomson Financial, which tracks merger data.
In July 2004, J.P. Morgan Chase and Bank One merged — as part of a 225-year 
journey — to form this exceptional company of ours: JPMorgan Chase. At its merger  
in 2004, the combined bank was the fourth largest bank in the world by market 
capitalization. But with patient groundwork over the years — fixing systems and 
upgrading technology, managing the notable acquisitions of Bear Stearns and 
Washington Mutual (WaMu) and continuing to reinvest, including in our talent —  
we have made our company an endgame winner. 
In earlier years, banks worried about their survival. While the past two decades have 
brought some virtually unprecedented challenges, including the great financial crisis 
and a pandemic followed by a global shutdown, they did not stop us from 
accomplishing extraordinary things. Our bank has now emerged as the #1 bank by 
market capitalization. 
Each of our businesses is among the best in the world, with increased market share, 
strong financial results and an unwavering focus on serving our clients, communities 
and shareholders with distinction and dedication. The strengths that are embedded in 
JPMorgan Chase — the knowledge and cohesiveness of our people, our long-standing 
client relationships, our technology and product capabilities, our presence in more 
than 100 countries and our unquestionable fortress balance sheet — would be hard to 
replicate. Crucially, the strength of our company has allowed us to always be there for 
clients, governments and communities — in good times and in bad times — and this 
strength has enabled us to continually invest in building our businesses for the future.
You can see from the following charts what gains and improvements we have 
achieved along the way.

Group Chairman’s Statement
The year ahead
The Board is focused on sustaining resilience by 
enhancing reputation and performance. We will 
further develop our strategy to deliver value to  
all of our stakeholders within a governance 
framework that provides stability, prudence 
and effective oversight. 
‘As a well-diversified business underpinned  
by historically stable revenue generation and 
significant capital strength, HSBC is well 
equipped to manage the risks and uncertainty 
inherent in today’s world.’
We expect the world’s major economies to show 
reasonable growth in 2018, helped by relatively 
low unemployment, recovering consumer 
confidence and improving trade. Fears of a  
hard landing in China have receded, and  
markets across Asia look set for a strong year. 
The anticipated conclusion of large regional  
trade agreements in 2018, mostly involving  
Asian nations, also provides cause for optimism. 
With an international network covering 90% of 
global trade flows and a leading presence in the 
world’s fastest growing region, we are in a prime 
position to help our customers capitalise on  
this broad-based global growth.
While we are optimistic about the prospects for 
the global economy, rising international tensions, 
the threat of protectionism and a lack of inclusive 
growth all have the potential to disrupt economic 
activity. We continue to model and anticipate a 
wide range of scenarios as part of our day-to-day 
risk management, to cover unlikely but not 
impossible events. As a well-diversified business 
underpinned by historically stable revenue 
generation and significant capital strength,  
HSBC is well equipped to manage the risks  
and uncertainty inherent in today’s world.

Strategic Report | Group Chairman’s Statement
‘It is important not just to achieve good results, 
but to do so in a way that treats all of our 
stakeholders in a fair and transparent way.’
Transparency and disclosure
Last year, we published a range of environmental, 
social and governance (‘ESG’) metrics to enable 
investors and customers to assess our non-
financial performance. The data we disclose will 
continue to evolve as we learn more about what 
our stakeholders find useful and improve our  
ability to collect the necessary information.  
We will publish our next ESG Update on our 
website in April 2018.
We are also making our first disclosure under the 
terms of the Financial Stability Board’s Task Force 
on Climate-related Financial Disclosures. This  
can be found on page 27. As one of the world’s  
largest international banks, we take seriously  
our responsibility to help develop a voluntary, 
consistent and comparable system of climate-
related financial disclosure. We intend to continue 
to expand and improve the quality and specificity 
of these disclosures, and to encourage all those 
who work with us to do the same. 
Supporting our people
It is important not just to achieve good results,  
but to do so in a way that treats all of our 
stakeholders – employees, customers, regulators 
and shareholders – in a fair and transparent way. 
We are committed to holding ourselves to account 
in meeting that aim, and to being accountable to 
our stakeholders for our actions. 
As part of this commitment, the Board and I are 
determined to ensure that HSBC remains a place 
where all our people have the opportunity to  
fulfil their potential in a nurturing environment  
that encourages the right behaviour. Our 
stakeholders expect honesty and integrity and  
we will continue to promote a culture in which 
people do the right thing. 
My special thanks are due on behalf of the Board 
to each of the 229,000 people who work for HSBC 
around the world. In my short time as Group 
Chairman I have been enormously impressed by 
the effort, energies and ability of our people in 
each country I have visited. These results are a 
testament to their hard work and dedication.

Group Chief Executive’s Review
Group Chief Executive’s 
Review
HSBC is simpler, stronger and more secure than it 
was in 2011, and better able to connect customers to 
opportunities in the world’s fastest growing regions.
Stuart Gulliver Group Chief Executive
2017 was an important year for HSBC. We 
completed the transformation programme that  
we started in 2015, maximising the benefits of  
our network and increasing our competitive 
advantages. By the end of the year we had 
exceeded our risk-weighted asset and cost-saving 
targets, rebuilt our Mexico business, delivered 
revenue growth from our international network  
in excess of global economic growth, and 
accelerated investment in our operations in Asia. 
We also opened new businesses and launched 
products that considerably strengthen the service 
that we offer our international clients. 
These achievements, and the work that preceded 
them, were a critical factor in delivering a strong 
financial performance in 2017. The strength of our 
three main global businesses generated significant 
increases in both reported and adjusted Group 
profit before tax (‘PBT’), while reported PBT also 
benefited from the non-recurrence of a number  
of large significant items from 2016. Adjusted PBT 
and adjusted revenue were up in four out of five 
regions. We grew adjusted revenue faster than 
adjusted costs, and continued to increase our 
market share in strategic product areas. 
Business performance
Retail Banking and Wealth Management had  
an excellent 2017, with strong adjusted revenue 
increases across a number of business lines.  
In Retail Banking, interest rate rises helped to 
grow revenue as our robust balance sheet and 
capital strength continued to attract deposits, 
particularly in Hong Kong. We continued to grow 
lending in our target markets, especially Hong 
Kong, the UK and Mexico. Wealth Management 
benefited from improving customer investment 
appetite, strong product sales across all 
categories and the impact of market movements 
on our life insurance manufacturing businesses.
Commercial Banking adjusted revenue grew well 
on the back of an outstanding performance in 
Global Liquidity and Cash Management. Higher 
lending volumes helped Credit and Lending 
overcome the impact of narrower spreads. Global 
Trade and Receivables Finance revenue stabilised 
after a difficult 2016 and we increased our share 
of major markets, including trade finance in  
Hong Kong and receivables finance in the UK. 
HSBC was voted market leader for trade finance 
in Euromoney’s annual trade finance survey in 
January 2018.
Global Banking and Markets grew adjusted 
revenue, driven particularly by strong growth  
in Global Liquidity and Cash Management,  
and Securities Services. Growth in the first three 
quarters of the year in Markets and Banking 
enabled both to withstand the effects of subdued 
market activity in the fourth quarter.
Global Private Banking adjusted revenue reflected 
the impact of historical repositioning, but was 
stable over the course of 2017. The business grew 
adjusted revenue by 10% in its target markets.
Our strong revenue generation meant that the 
Group achieved positive adjusted jaws in 2017. 
We accelerated investment to grow the  
business, particularly in Retail Banking and  
Wealth Management, which contributed to an  
increase in adjusted costs. Performance-related 
compensation also grew in line with profit  
before tax.

--- Page 10 ---
Strategic Report | Group Chief Executive's Review
Adjusted loan impairment charges were 
significantly lower than 2016, mainly due  
to improved conditions in the oil and gas  
industry in North America. 
Our strong common equity tier one ratio of 14.5% 
included the effect of recent changes in US tax 
legislation, which reduced our capital position by  
9 basis points. It also included the impact of our 
most recent $2bn share buy-back. In 2017, we 
returned a total of $3bn to shareholders through 
share buy-backs and paid more in dividends  
than any other European or American bank.  
We achieved this while maintaining one of the 
strongest capital ratios in the industry.
‘We have delivered excellent value to 
shareholders through a total shareholder return 
of 70.3% from 2011 to the end of 2017.’
Strategic actions
The strength of our business is due in large part  
to the strategic actions that we first announced in 
June 2015. This programme concluded at the end 
of 2017 with eight out of ten actions completed on 
time and on target (see pages 12 to 13). 
HSBC is much more capital efficient and capable  
of producing stronger returns for investors as a 
consequence of these actions. Our cost-reduction 
programmes have enabled us to absorb the cost of 
growing the business and protecting HSBC from 
financial crime, while improving the efficiency and 
security of our processes. 
Our previously underperforming Mexico business 
is increasingly profitable and well positioned for 
further growth. Whilst our US business remains  
a work in progress, it is a valuable source of 
business for other regions and continues to make 
important progress. We also completed the run-off 
of our legacy US consumer and mortgage lending 
portfolio, bringing an end to a difficult chapter  
in HSBC’s recent history.
Our international network is now much better  
able to connect customers to opportunities and 
delivering revenue growth above that of the global 
economy. 53% of client revenue now comes from 
international clients, up from 50% in 2015. Global 
Liquidity and Cash Management in particular is 
now a major component of the bank’s success, 
and Global Trade and Receivables Finance has 
extended its leadership of the global trade  
finance market.
The Group’s business mix is more oriented towards 
Asia, improving our ability to channel the economic 
and social changes taking place within the world’s 
fastest growing region. Asia contributes a larger 
proportion of the Group’s profits than in 2015, 
reflecting regional investment in growing our  
loan book, building our insurance and asset 
management businesses, and connecting 
customers to opportunities within the region. 
We continued to expand our presence in mainland 
China with the launch of new retail banking 
products and increased lending in the Pearl River 
Delta. In December we launched HSBC Qianhai 
Securities, the first securities joint venture in 
mainland China to be majority-owned by an 
international bank. This allows us to offer our 
clients increased access to China’s rapidly 
expanding capital markets and provides an 
unprecedented opportunity to establish and grow  
a securities business in mainland China with strong 
international standards. This underlines our status 
as the leading international bank in mainland China. 
We won a number of significant new business 
mandates related to the China-led Belt and Road 
Initiative in 2017, and opened new China desks in 
Poland, Luxembourg, Thailand and Macau to 
capture further opportunities. We now have a  
total of 24 China desks aimed at supporting 
Chinese businesses with global outbound 
ambitions, 20 of which are along the ‘Belt and 
Road’ routes. In November we were named  
‘Best Bank for Belt and Road’ at the FinanceAsia 
Achievement Awards 2017.

Group Chief Executive's Review
‘My sincere thanks go to all of my HSBC 
colleagues around the world, past and present, 
whose hard work and commitment are the 
foundation of the bank’s success.’
Fighting financial crime
For the past five years, we have been weaving 
Global Standards into the fabric of HSBC. The 
investment that we have made in our financial 
crime risk management capabilities has 
considerably strengthened our ability to protect  
the integrity of the financial system. We have 
assembled a highly expert team which is helping  
to shape the debate about our industry’s role in  
the fight against financial crime. We have made 
great strides in building a compliance function fit 
for the many evolving challenges we face, and  
built partnerships to combat financial crime with 
regulatory and law enforcement authorities  
around the world. 
The expiration in December of the five-year 
deferred prosecution agreement that we entered 
into with the US Department of Justice in 2012 
(‘AML DPA’) was an important milestone for HSBC. 
Nevertheless, exiting the AML DPA was a product 
rather than the focus of the essential work that we 
have done to transform our compliance capabilities 
and protect the financial system. This work will 
continue as we seek to ensure that the changes  
we have made are effective and sustainable. 
Combating financial crime is a never-ending 
exercise and will be a constant focus for the 
Group’s management.
Thank you
As I prepare to pass on the stewardship of HSBC 
to my successor, I am proud of our achievements 
of the last seven and a half years. After the most 
extensive transformation programme in HSBC’s 
153 year history, HSBC is simpler, stronger and 
more secure than it was in 2011, and better able 
to connect customers to opportunities in the 
world’s fastest growing regions. We have also 
delivered excellent value to shareholders through 
a higher share price, $64.7bn in declared 
dividends and $5.5bn in share buy-backs, 
representing a total shareholder return of 70.3% 
from 2011 to the end of 2017. 
I am pleased to be handing over to such a 
capable successor as John Flint, whose  
intimate knowledge of HSBC and its culture  
will be a considerable asset to the bank and its 
clients. I am grateful to my colleagues on the 
Group Management Board for their support 
since 2011, and to Douglas Flint and Mark Tucker 
for their backing. 
Finally, my sincere thanks go to all of my HSBC 
colleagues around the world, past and present, 
whose hard work and commitment are the 
foundation of the bank’s success. It has been my 
privilege to work with them for the last 38 years.

Strategic Report
Our strategy
We have developed a long-term strategy that 
reflects our purpose and enables us to capture 
value from our international network.
Two-pronged long-term strategy
Develop our international network
To serve enterprises across geographies and facilitate 
international trade and capital flows, thereby helping our 
clients to grow their business.
Invest in wealth and retail businesses 
with local scale
To make the most of global social mobility, wealth creation 
and long-term demographic changes in our select retail 
banking and wealth management markets.
Value of the network and our strategy
Access to global growth 
opportunities
Our unparalleled network covers 
countries accounting for 
approximately 90% of global GDP, 
trade and capital flows. We have 
a leading presence in large and 
fast-growing economies.
Our network covers all of the world’s 
30 largest trade corridors forecast 
for 2030. These top 30 corridors 
are expected to have a compound 
annual growth rate well in excess 
of GDP growth expectations from 
2016 to 2030.
Lower risk profile and  
volatility from our 
geographically diversified 
universal banking model
We operate a balanced universal 
banking model across both 
wholesale and retail businesses 
and we are geographically 
diversified. This has resulted in a 
lower risk profile and lower earnings 
volatility compared to our global 
peers. Our business model has 
remained resilient through business 
cycles, and it helps ensure stable 
funding and liquidity.
Strong capital and  
funding base
CET1 ratio of 14.5% supported by 
increased shareholders’ equity to 
meet new regulatory requirements 
since the end of 2010.
Four interconnected, global 
businesses share balance sheets 
and liquidity in addition to strong 
commercial links.
Stable shareholder returns
Industry leading dividend – 
approximately $65bn declared 
from 2011 to 2017 – as well as 
circa $5.5bn of share repurchases.

Client examples
Trina Solar (‘Trina’): 
China, renewable 
energy
Exporter of solar panels 
globally. Trina’s aim is to 
bring China’s green energy 
solutions to countries along 
the Belt and Road Initiative 
route, and has thus stepped 
up its overseas investment, 
particularly in the ASEAN 
region. HSBC created a 
digital platform for Trina 
that gave its headquarters 
a transparent view of its 
ASEAN-region subsidiaries’ 
cash positions and set up 
a cash pool in Singapore to 
seamlessly connect Trina’s 
HSBC accounts globally.
Reckitt Benckiser (‘RB’): 
UK, consumer goods
Zhejiang Geely:  
China, automotive
Global consumer health 
and hygiene company. 
HSBC acted as financial 
adviser and lead financier 
to Reckitt Benckiser on  
its $18bn acquisition of 
Mead Johnson Nutrition 
Company, a leader in infant 
and children’s nutrition. 
This acquisition marked 
one of the largest UK into 
US transactions and 
considerably strengthened 
RB’s presence in developing 
markets, particularly China.
Leading automobile 
manufacturer. HSBC served 
as sole financial adviser 
for Zhejiang Geely on two 
interlinked China outbound 
investments, one in 
Malaysian carmaker Proton 
Holdings and the second in 
Lotus Advance Technologies, 
a subsidiary of Proton 
based in the UK. These 
transactions were enabled 
by collaboration between 
HSBC teams in mainland 
China, Hong Kong, 
Singapore, Malaysia  
and London.
Morgan McKinley: 
Ireland, professional 
services
Global recruitment agency 
with operations in Ireland, 
UK, EMEA and APAC. In 
2017, Morgan McKinley 
expanded HSBC’s global 
mandate to include cross-
border Global Trade and 
Receivables Finance 
(‘GTRF’) facilities and 
Global Liquidity and Cash 
Management (‘GLCM’) 
services in Canada and 
Japan. HSBC’s ‘one-team’ 
approach, not separated 
by product, was cited by 
the client as being a key 
driver in the decision to 
switch to HSBC.

Strategic Report
Strategic actions
We met eight out of ten targets from the strategic actions  
outlined in our Investor Update in June 2015.
Capturing value from our international network
In June 2015, we outlined a series 
of strategic actions to make the most 
of our competitive advantages and 
respond to a changing environment.
These actions focused on using our 
resources more efficiently and on 
investing for growth. Each action 
had targets defined to the end of  
2017. The table opposite contains 
a summary of our progress with 
additional details provided below.
Resizing and simplifying 
our business
We passed several significant 
milestones in resizing and simplifying 
our business in 2017. Our 
management actions delivered 
a gross reduction of risk-weighted 
assets (‘RWAs’) by $338bn, exceeding 
our RWA reduction target from 
management initiatives by $60bn 
on an FX-adjusted basis. 
Among our NAFTA region Investor 
Update targets, we did not reach our 
US profit before tax (‘PBT’) target of 
$2bn. However, we have taken steps 
forward in, for example, our US Retail 
Banking and Wealth Management 
(‘RBWM’) business, where we 
increased PBT, revenues and deposits, 
and migrated over one million 
customers to our impending new core 
banking platform. We also completed 
the wind-down of our US consumer 
and mortgage lending (‘CML’) run-off 
portfolio. In Mexico, our adjusted PBT 
reached $440m, surpassing our Investor 
Update target on a local currency 
basis. We also grew adjusted revenue 
in Mexico by 11% compared with 
2016, supported by increased loan 
balances from market share gains. 
We remain on course to complete 
the set-up of our UK ring-fenced bank 
(‘RFB’) ahead of the 1 January 2019 
statutory deadline. In 2017, we 
received a restricted bank licence for 
the RFB and are working through an 
agreed mobilisation plan with the 
Prudential Regulatory Authority and 
Financial Conduct Authority to receive 
an unrestricted licence in 2018.
We successfully concluded our cost-
saving programme and realised $6.1bn 
of annual run-rate savings, over $1bn 
more than our Investor Update target. 
The programme enabled 2017 exit 
run-rate adjusted costs to be kept flat 
compared with the 2014 cost base. 
The savings offset increased costs from 
areas such as regulatory programmes 
and compliance, and investments to 
help facilitate further business growth. 
For example, in RBWM, we expanded 
the use of biometrics globally with 
over 1.5 million customers using voice 
recognition, and with fingerprint 
technology launched in nine of our 
markets. For our corporate customers, 
we improved our key digital channels 
with significant improvements to 
HSBCnet and HSBC Connect. Our  
costs-to-achieve transformation 
concluded with approximately $7bn 
spent since the start of the programme. 
Redeploying capital to grow 
our business
Our international network remains core 
to our strategy, and we achieved our 
Investor Update target of revenue 
growth above GDP. In 2017, we grew 
our revenue from transaction banking 
products by 6%, including double-digit 
percentage growth in GLCM and HSBC 
Security Services (‘HSS’). We grew 
GTRF market share in key markets, in 
particular Hong Kong and receivables 
finance in the UK. Cross-border 
revenues from our priority corridors 
grew 10%, with double-digit percentage 
growth in four of our five largest priority 
corridors including our China-US 
corridor. We were named ‘Top Global 
Trade Finance Bank’ by our clients in the 
Euromoney Trade Finance Survey 2018.
We delivered on our 2015 Investor 
Update commitment to prioritise and 
accelerate investments in Asia. In 2017, 
we grew our loan portfolio in the region 
by $53bn to $426bn. Our asset 
management and insurance businesses 
in Asia realised 17% and 8% growth in 
AUM and annualised new business 
premiums, respectively. In mainland 
China, we reached over 400,000 cards 
in circulation since launching credit 
cards at the end of 2016, and we grew 
our customer loans in the Pearl River 
Delta region by 23%. We launched 
HSBC Qianhai Securities, the first 
securities joint venture in mainland 
China to be majority-owned by an 
international bank.
Revenue tied to renminbi (‘RMB’) 
internationalisation in 2017 of $1.2bn did 
not meet our Investor Update target of 
$2.0bn to $2.5bn. This was largely due 
to a decrease in overall market volumes. 
However, we continue to be recognised 
as the leading bank for international 
RMB products and services. We ranked 
first in Bloomberg’s offshore RMB bond 
underwriting league table in 2017 with 
28% market share and first for the sixth 
year in a row in the Asiamoney Offshore 
RMB Poll 2017. We had the largest 
share, at 53%, of approved quota of 
RMB Qualified Foreign Institutional 
Investor (‘RQFII’) custodian business.

Strategic Report
Financial overview
Reported results
This table shows our reported results for 
the last three years, ended 31 December 
2017, 2016 and 2015.
All commentary in this financial 
overview compares the 2017 results 
with 2016, unless otherwise stated. 
Reported profit before tax 
Reported profit before tax of $17.2bn 
was $10.1bn or 141% higher, mainly 
reflecting a net favourable movement of 
significant items of $8.5bn, which is 
described in more detail on page 32. 
Excluding significant items and an 
adverse effect of foreign currency 
translation of $0.5bn, profit before tax 
increased by $2.1bn or 11%.
Reported revenue
Reported revenue of $51.4bn was 
$3.5bn or 7% higher, partly reflecting a 
net favourable movement in significant 
items of $2.0bn, which included:
 – in 2016, unfavourable fair value 
movements on our own debt designated 
at fair value reflecting changes in our 
own credit spread of $1.8bn, which are 
now reported in other comprehensive 
income, following our partial early 
adoption of IFRS 9 ‘Financial 
Instruments’ on 1 January 2017; and
 – favourable fair value movements in 
2017 of $0.1bn on non-qualifying 
hedges, compared with adverse 
movements of $0.7bn in 2016.
Net favourable movements were partly 
offset by:
 – in 2016, a $0.7bn gain on the disposal 
of our membership interests in Visa 
Europe and Visa Inc. This compared 
with a $0.3bn gain on the disposal of 
our shares in Visa Inc. during 2017;
 – adverse debit value adjustments on 
derivative contracts in 2017 of $0.4bn, 
compared with minimal movements  
in 2016; and
 – in 2017, a $0.1bn provision related to 
customer redress programmes in the 
UK, and a $0.1bn charge arising from 
the opportunity to increase our 
investment in new businesses.

Significant items also included a loss of 
$1.7bn recognised in 2016 on the sale of 
operations in Brazil to Banco Bradesco 
S.A., which was completed on 1 July 
2016. This loss was substantially offset 
by the reported revenue earned by the 
Brazil business during 2016 of $1.5bn. 
Excluding significant items, and an 
adverse effect of foreign currency 
translation of $0.7bn, revenue increased 
by $2.2bn or 5%, reflecting growth in 
Retail Banking and Wealth Management 
(‘RBWM’), Commercial Banking (‘CMB’) 
and Global Banking and Markets 
(‘GB&M’).
Reported LICs
Reported loan impairment charges  
and other credit risk provisions (‘LICs’) 
of $1.8bn were $1.6bn lower, in part 
reflecting the effect of significant items, 
which comprised the LICs incurred  
by our operations in Brazil in 2016  
of $0.7bn.
Excluding significant items and the 
adverse effect of foreign currency 
translation of $0.1bn, LICs decreased  
by $0.8bn or 32%. The reduction in  
LICs was primarily in CMB, RBWM  
and Corporate Centre.
Reported operating expenses
Reported operating expenses of 
$34.9bn were $4.9bn or 12% lower.  
This included a net decrease in 
significant items of $5.6bn, including:
 – a $3.2bn write-off of goodwill in our 
GPB business in Europe in 2016;
 – a net release of $0.4bn in settlements 
and provisions in connection with legal 
matters, compared with charges in 
2016 of $0.7bn;
 – operating expenses of $1.1bn in 1H16 
incurred by the operations in Brazil that 
we sold; and
 – costs to achieve of $3.0bn, compared 
with $3.1bn in 2016.
Excluding significant items and a 
favourable effect of foreign currency 
translation of $0.3bn, operating 
expenses increased by $1.1bn. This 
increase mainly reflected increased 
investment in growth programmes, 
primarily in RBWM, where investments 
were partly funded by the proceeds 
from our disposal of Visa shares,  
and higher performance-related pay.

delivering against this mandate. The Board has 
endorsed a plan that aims to reallocate capital 
to areas that can deliver stronger returns, to 
reduce costs across the Group, and to simplify  
the business.
Even in this increasingly challenging 
competitive environment, there are many 
opportunities for a bank of HSBC’s scale  
and reach. We have made a good start in 
capturing these opportunities, but we need  
to go further and faster to capitalise fully on 
our heritage, network and financial strength. 
We are intent on driving through the 
necessary change at pace.
Board of Directors
Our previous Group Chief Executive,  
John Flint, left the Group in August 2019.  
I am very grateful to John for his personal 
commitment and dedication, and for the 
significant contribution that he made over his 
long career at HSBC. Noel Quinn joined the 
Board as interim Group Chief Executive in 
August 2019. The process for appointing a 
permanent Group Chief Executive is ongoing 
and we expect to make an appointment in 
accordance with our original timetable.
José Antonio Meade Kuribreña joined the 
Board as an independent non-executive 
Director in March 2019.
Jonathan Evans (Lord Evans of Weardale) 
retired from the Board in April 2019. Marc 
Moses stepped down as an executive Director 
and Group Chief Risk Officer at the end of 
December 2019. Sir Jonathan Symonds 
stepped down as Deputy Group Chairman  
and Senior Independent Director today, and  
is replaced in the role of Senior Independent 
Director by David Nish. Kathleen Casey has 
informed the Board that she will not stand  
for re-election at the next AGM, in April 2020. 
Jonathan, Marc, Jon and Kathy have all made 
formidable and invaluable contributions to  
the work of the Board and they leave with  
our profound thanks and gratitude.
At the time of our interim results,  
I said that the external environment  
was becoming increasingly complex  
and challenging. As our 2019 results 
demonstrate, this has proven to be  
the case.
An impairment of historical goodwill caused  
our reported profit before tax to fall by 33%, 
but the strength and resilience of our business 
model delivered an adjusted profit before  
tax of $22.2bn, up 5%. Retail Banking  
and Wealth Management, Commercial 
Banking and Global Private Banking 
performed well, while our leading transaction 
banking franchise again demonstrated the 
effectiveness of our global network. This, 
alongside the Group’s capital strength, has 
given the Board the confidence to approve  
an unchanged dividend of $0.51 for 2019.

Group Chairman’s statement
“ Even in this environment, 
there are many 
opportunities for a bank of 
HSBC’s scale and reach.”
The global economy
HSBC is a global bank, albeit one closely 
associated with mainland China, Hong Kong 
and the UK. Each of these continues to face 
major challenges.
We continue to monitor the coronavirus 
outbreak very closely. Our priority is  
always the well-being of our customers and 
staff, and we will continue to do all we can  
to ensure their safety and support them 
through this difficult time.
Social unrest in Hong Kong has weighed on 
the local economy and caused significant 
disruption. We deplore all violence and 
support a peaceful resolution under the 
framework of ‘one country, two systems’.  
I am enormously proud of the dedication  
and perseverance of our people in Hong Kong, 
who have continued to support our customers 
to their utmost ability in spite of the difficulties 
they have faced.
Now that the UK has officially left the  
EU, negotiations can begin on their future 
relationship. This has provided some  
certainty, but no trade negotiation is ever 
straightforward. It is essential that the eventual 
agreement protects and fosters the many 
benefits that financial services provide to  
both the UK and the EU. At the same time  
as remaining close to Europe, the UK must 
also strengthen its links with other key 
partners, including the US, China and 
south-east Asia. We look forward to working 
with governments to help achieve this.
The macroeconomic environment as a whole 
remains uncertain. As a result of the impact  
of the coronavirus outbreak, we have lowered 
our expectations for growth in the Asian 
economy in 2020. The main impact will  
be in the first quarter, but we expect some 
improvement as the virus becomes contained. 
The agreement of a ‘phase one’ trade deal 
between China and the US is a positive step, 
but we remain cautious about the prospects 
for a wider-ranging agreement given 
disagreements that still exist, particularly  
over technology. We expect growth in the  
US to be resilient, but slower than in 2019.
Overall, we expect global growth to  
stabilise over the course of 2020, albeit  
at a slightly lower rate than in recent years. 
This underlines the need to make the most  
of the opportunities ahead.
Serving all our stakeholders
HSBC has long recognised its responsibilities 
to its stakeholders. Being a responsible 
corporate citizen is a principle that must  
sit at the heart of any sustainable business.  
I welcome the renewed focus and debate 
around corporate purpose in the media and 
elsewhere over the last 12 months. We are 
committed to creating long-term value for all 
those we work with and for – our investors, 
customers, employees, suppliers and the 
communities we serve. 
Business also has a critical role to play in  
the transition to a low-carbon future, and we 
believe that we have an opportunity to be a 
leader. Sustainability features prominently in 
our strategy, as well as in the way we run the 
business. We are absolutely committed to 
working closely with our customers, regulators 
and governments to accelerate progress 
towards a cleaner and more sustainable world. 
The steps we are taking to achieve this are 
outlined in our ESG Update, which is also 
published today.
Our people are the driving force behind 
HSBC’s success. 2019 was a challenging  
year, throughout which the professionalism 
and expertise of our people were always  
to the fore in even the most testing 
circumstances. I am very grateful to them  
for their hard work and their commitment  
to our customers, and each other.

As we pursue our plan to deliver greater value for our 
customers and shareholders, we will continue to seek  
to grow the parts of the business where we are  
strongest while addressing areas of underperformance.
digital capabilities, and to make it easier  
for our customers to bank with us. This  
has enhanced the service we offer, helping  
to attract new customers and capture  
market share in our major markets and  
from our international network.
This was evident in a resilient performance in 
2019. A strong first half, particularly in Asia, 
was tempered by the impact of worsening 
global economic conditions, geopolitical 
uncertainty and a lower interest rate outlook 
in the second half of the year. Much of our 
business held up well, particularly in Asia  
and the markets served by our international 
network. However, underperformance in 
other areas acted as a drag on the returns  
of the Group.
As we pursue our plan to deliver greater  
value for our customers and shareholders,  
we will continue to seek to grow the parts of  
the business where we are strongest. However, 
given the changed economic environment, we 
must also act decisively to reshape areas of 
persistent underperformance, particularly in 
Global Banking and Markets in Europe and  
the US. We also aim to simplify the Group to 
accelerate the pace of change and reduce the 
size of its cost base. This should create a leaner, 
simpler and more competitive Group that is 
better positioned to deliver higher returns  
for investors.
Financial performance
Group reported profit before tax was down 
33% compared with 2018, due to a goodwill 
impairment of $7.3bn. This arose from  
an update to long-term economic growth 
assumptions, which impacted a number of our 
businesses, and from the planned reshaping  
of Global Banking and Markets. Adjusted  
profit before tax increased by 5%, reflecting 
revenue growth in three of our four global 
businesses. Disciplined cost management 
helped secure positive adjusted jaws of 3.1%, 
despite continued heavy investment in growth 
and technology. Our Group return on average 
tangible equity – our headline measure –  
fell from 8.6% in 2018 to 8.4%.
We delivered good revenue growth in our 
targeted areas. Our Hong Kong business and 
our UK ring-fenced bank, HSBC UK, showed 
great resilience to produce adjusted revenue 
growth of 7% and 3% respectively, despite 
the uncertainty affecting both places during 
2019. Our businesses in Mexico, India, the 
ASEAN region and mainland China also 
performed well. The biggest areas of

HSBC exists for a clear purpose – to 
connect customers to opportunities. We 
want to be where the growth is, enabling 
businesses to thrive and economies to 
prosper, and helping people to fulfil their 
hopes and realise their ambitions. 
For 155 years, this purpose has underpinned 
all that we do, and it continues to guide us as 
we seek to adapt HSBC to changing customer 
expectations in an evolving economic, political 
and digital landscape.
HSBC possesses a number of advantages that 
set us apart from our competitors. We have 
an extensive international footprint with 
excellent access to faster-growing areas in 
Asia and the Middle East; a market-leading 
transaction banking franchise connecting 
customers to opportunities around the world; 
and full-scale retail banking operations in 
Hong Kong, the UK and Mexico, with a 
premier international wealth proposition.
In 2018, we began a programme of 
investment to build on these strengths,  
with our customers at the centre. We have 
since invested more than $8.6bn – of which 
$4.5bn was in 2019 – to connect more 
customers to our international network, to 
provide a better service through improved

future, and build a platform 
for sustainable growth.”
underperformance were our businesses  
in the US and our European non-ring-fenced 
bank, both of which saw a reduction in 
revenue and profit before tax.
Retail Banking and Wealth Management  
had a good year, delivering adjusted revenue 
growth of 9%. This reflected the impact  
of investment in improved customer service 
and growth, which helped us win new 
customers, increase deposits, and grow 
lending in our major markets, particularly 
mortgage lending in the UK and Hong Kong. 
Our Wealth business also benefited from 
favourable market impacts in Insurance.
Commercial Banking grew adjusted revenue 
by 6%, with increases in all major products 
and regions. Investment in new platforms, 
digital capabilities and increased lending 
improved our ability to attract new customers 
and capitalise on wider margins, particularly 
in Global Liquidity and Cash Management and 
Credit and Lending.
Global Banking and Markets had a 
challenging year in which economic 
uncertainty led to reduced client activity, 
particularly in Europe and the US. Despite 
this, adjusted revenue was just 1% lower  
than 2018 due to strong performances  
from our transaction banking businesses.
Global Private Banking continued to benefit 
from close collaboration with our other global 
businesses, attracting $23bn of net new 
money and increasing adjusted revenue  
by 5%. 
2020 outlook
Since the start of January, the coronavirus 
outbreak has created significant disruption for 
our staff, suppliers and customers, particularly 
in mainland China and Hong Kong. We 
understand the difficulties this poses and have 
put measures in place to support them through 
this challenging time. Depending on how the 
situation develops, there is the potential for any 
associated economic slowdown to impact our 
expected credit losses in Hong Kong and 
mainland China. Longer term, it is also possible 
that we may see revenue reductions from 
lower lending and transaction volumes, and 
further credit losses stemming from disruption 
to customer supply chains. We continue to 
monitor the situation closely.
Reshaping for sustainable growth
Our immediate aims are to increase returns, 
create the capacity to invest in the future,  
and build a platform for sustainable growth. 
We intend to do this in three ways.
First, we plan to materially reshape the 
underperforming areas of the Group. Around  
30% of our capital is currently allocated to 
businesses that are delivering returns below 
their cost of equity, largely in Global Banking 
and Markets in Europe and the US. We intend 
to focus these businesses on our strengths as 
a leading international bank and to simplify our 
footprint, exiting businesses where necessary 
and reducing both risk-weighted assets  
and costs.
Second, we aim to reduce Group costs by 
increasing efficiencies, sharing capabilities  
and investing in automation and digitisation.
Third, we intend to simplify HSBC to increase 
the pace of execution and agility. This includes 
changing our matrix structure and reducing 
fragmentation, simplifying the geographical 
organisation of the Group, and combining Retail 
Banking and Wealth Management and Global 
Private Banking to create one of the world’s 
largest wealth management businesses.
In total, we are targeting more than $100bn  
of gross risk-weighted asset reductions, a 
reduced cost base of $31bn or lower, and a 
Group return on average tangible equity of 
10% to 12% in 2022. We aim to reinvest the 
risk-weighted assets saved into higher-growth, 
higher-returning opportunities in other parts of 
the business. We intend to do these things 
while sustaining the dividend and maintaining 
a CET1 ratio of 14% to 15%. This is described  
in detail on pages 12 and 13.
Since my appointment in August, we have 
reduced Group risk-weighted assets and  
FTE headcount, and slowed our cost growth 
considerably. We also began the run-down of 
risk-weighted assets in our European business 
in the fourth quarter of 2019. We will provide 
an update on our progress as we report  
future results.
Connecting customers to opportunities
The investment we are making in growth, 
technology and innovation is improving our 
service to customers and connecting them  
to opportunities around the world.
For our retail customers, we introduced more 
than 160 new digital features in 2019 to make 
everyday banking easier, including improved 
digital account opening, loan and mortgage 
applications, and instant money transfers.
In Hong Kong, we have made it simpler and 
faster for our Hong Kong customers to make 
payments through our redesigned PayMe app, 
and launched PayMe for Business, expanding 
the PayMe ecosystem for the 1.9 million 
individual account holders who use it as part  
of their daily lives.
Global Banking and Markets launched  
MyDeal in 2019 to make the deal execution 
process in our primary capital markets 
business more efficient for our clients. Our 
Global Private Banking business also launched 
a new online investment services portal to 
give our customers more control over the 
service they receive.
Commercial Banking launched Serai in 2019  
to simplify international trade for SMEs with 
global trade ambitions. It provides both a 
digital lending product and a networking 
platform to match buyers and sellers and  
build trusted business relationships. We  
also remained at the forefront of international 
efforts to commercialise blockchain 
technology to make trade finance easier, faster 
and safer for businesses. As part of this, we 
completed 11 letters of credit transactions 
using blockchain technology in 2019, including 
the first cross-border transaction in China.
Our people
It was a great honour to be asked to lead 
HSBC on an interim basis and I am grateful to 
John Flint for making the transition as smooth 
as possible. John was an excellent servant of 
HSBC for more than 30 years and leaves with 
our good wishes.
I am proud to work with all of my colleagues 
across 64 countries and territories who serve 
HSBC and its customers with exceptional 
dedication. I am particularly grateful to 
colleagues in Hong Kong, mainland China  
and the UK for their professionalism and 
application during recent periods of high 
uncertainty. I thank them sincerely for their 
service and support.

Strategic report
Group Chairman’s statement
As we signalled at our interim results, we are 
committed to ensuring our shareholders share 
the benefits of our improved performance. The 
Board approved a second interim dividend for 
2022 of $0.23 per share, bringing the full year 
dividend for 2022 to $0.32 per share. We are 
establishing a dividend payout ratio of 50%  
of reported earnings per share for 2023 and 
2024, excluding material significant items, and 
we aim to restore the dividend to pre-Covid-19 
levels as soon as possible. We also intend to 
return to paying quarterly dividends from the 
start of 2023.
Subject to completion of the planned sale  
of our banking business in Canada, the 
Board’s intention is to consider the payment  
of a special dividend of $0.21 per share as  
a priority use of the proceeds generated.  
A decision in relation to any potential dividend 
would be made following the completion  
of the transaction, currently expected in  
late 2023, with payment following in early 
2024. Any remaining additional surplus  
capital is expected to be allocated towards 
opportunities for organic growth and 
investment alongside share buy-backs,  
which would be in addition to any existing 
share buy-back programme. 
Board operations
In 2022, the Board met in person in London, 
Hong Kong, New York and Riyadh – on each 
occasion also undertaking a wide range of 
engagements with clients, colleagues, 
government officials and regulators. The 
importance of engaging with our teams was 
also underlined by the appointment of José 
(Pepe) Meade as Board member with specific 
responsibility for employee liaison. At the 
same time as holding some in-person 
meetings, the continued use of virtual 
meetings enabled us to retain the benefits  
of greater efficiency and reduced costs.
At the 2022 Annual General Meeting, Irene 
Lee and Pauline van der Meer Mohr stepped 
down from the Board. I am enormously 
grateful to them for their important and 
valuable contributions to the Board, the 
committees and the subsidiary entities on 
which they have served. Irene remains an 
independent non-executive Director of The 
Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation 
Limited and independent non-executive  
chair of Hang Seng Bank Limited. Geraldine 
Buckingham joined the Board as an 
independent non-executive Director on 1 May.
Following Ewen Stevenson’s departure, 
Georges Elhedery became Group Chief 
Financial Officer and joined the Board on  
1 January 2023. On behalf of the Board, I 
would like to again thank Ewen for all that  
he has done for the bank. His leadership, 
financial expertise and operational rigour  
have been invaluable to HSBC, and he  
leaves with our very best wishes.
Mark E Tucker
Group Chairman
The global economy remains volatile, but our strategy is 
delivering improved returns for shareholders and HSBC  
is well placed to compete as the economy recovers.
At the start of 2022, the ongoing impact 
of Covid-19 was the most dominant 
factor within the external environment. 
While further outbreaks in Hong Kong 
and mainland China significantly 
impacted economic growth, the Russia-
Ukraine war and rising inflation and 
interest rates had an even greater impact 
on the global economy in 2022. They are 
also likely to continue to have a greater 
economic impact than the pandemic in 
2023, as we are already seeing with a 
cost of living crisis affecting many of  
our customers and colleagues.
Strong financial performance and higher 
capital distributions
We supported our customers through the 
challenges that they faced at the same time as 
executing our strategic plan. The first phase of 
our transformation is now complete. The work 
that we have done has enabled us to emerge 
from the pandemic a stronger bank, better 
aligned to the international needs of our 
customers. 
The reshaping of our portfolio continued with 
the announcement of the planned sale of our 
banking business in Canada. We continued to 
develop our Wealth capabilities, especially in 
Asia, and this strategy gained traction in 2022. 
Our increased investment in technology has 
improved the customer experience and made 
our processes more efficient. Meanwhile, we 
continued to support our clients to transition 
to net zero, and also took further important 
steps towards our ambition of aligning our 
financed emissions to net zero by 2050. Given 
the urgency of today’s global energy crisis, it is 
now even more important that we continue to 
actively engage our clients on how they intend 
to prepare their businesses for a low-carbon 
future.
In 2022, reported profit before tax was 
$17.5bn, a decrease of $1.4bn compared with 
2021 due to the $2.4bn impairment on the 
planned sale of our French retail banking 
operations. Adjusted profit before tax was 
$24.0bn, an increase of $3.4bn on last year. All 
of our businesses grew profits in 2022, and we 
maintained our strong capital, funding and 
liquidity positions.

” Given the urgency of 
today’s global energy 
crisis, it is now even  
more important that  
we continue to actively 
engage our clients on  
how they intend to 
prepare their businesses 
for a low-carbon future.”
We also recently announced some changes  
to the Board. Kalpana Morparia will join the 
Board as an independent non-executive 
Director on 1 March. Jack Tai will retire from 
the Board at the conclusion of the 2023 AGM, 
and will be succeeded as Chair of the Group 
Risk Committee by Jamie Forese. Jack has 
made a significant and important contribution 
during his time on the Board, particularly  
in the strengthening of risk and conduct 
governance and oversight through a period  
of major change. We wish him very well in  
his future endeavours. 
Noel and I were delighted to meet face-to-face 
with our loyal Hong Kong shareholders at our 
Informal Shareholders Meeting in August. We 
have always greatly valued their feedback and 
engagement, and this meeting was as well 
attended as ever. We were pleased to discuss 
how our business has performed, our 
continued support of Hong Kong, and our 
commitment to growing shareholder value. 
We look forward to continuing these 
discussions in person in 2023.
Our strategy is working 
There were reports over the course of last  
year about ideas for alternative structures for 
HSBC. The Board has been fully engaged in 
examining these alternatives in depth, with the 
benefit of independent third-party financial 
and legal advice. It has been, and remains,  
our judgement that alternative structural 
options would not deliver increased value for 
shareholders. Rather, they would have a 
material negative impact on value.
For 157 years, we have followed trade and 
investment flows to support our customers  
as they fulfil their financial ambitions. We  
have used our experience, expertise and 
relationships to help our customers to  
navigate the world. 
to individuals and companies of all sizes 
whose financial ambitions span multiple 
countries and regions. Very few, if any, other 
banks can rival our ability to connect capital, 
ideas and people through a global network 
that facilitates the international access and 
collaboration required to succeed in today’s 
world.
Our performance in 2022 demonstrates  
that our current strategy is working and 
improving returns. We are also confident  
that it will deliver good returns for our 
shareholders over the coming years. The 
Board and management team are fully 
focused on delivering it.
An uneven macroeconomic outlook 
We will need to maintain this focus against  
an uneven macroeconomic outlook. The 
pandemic, high inflation and interest rates, 
and the Russia-Ukraine war all have 
implications for the global economy, including 
volatility in markets, supply chain disruption, 
pressure on small and medium-sized business 
and squeezes on the cost of living. Different 
economies also now face different challenges 
and have different opportunities in 2023.
China’s reopening and package of measures 
to stabilise the property market should provide 
a significant boost for its economy and the 
global economy, albeit with some near-term 
volatility. Our economists forecast China’s 
GDP will grow 5% in 2023. The reopening of 
the border means that Hong Kong, and the 
entire Greater Bay Area, are likely to be major 
beneficiaries, and I expect to see a strong 
recovery.
More broadly, Asia as a whole has proven 
resilient and there is the prospect of a  
strong rebound later in the year. Virtually  
all economies in the region have now 
recovered the output losses incurred during 
the pandemic and are above 2019 levels.
The Middle East economies enjoyed a strong 
2022, and we expect this momentum to 
continue in 2023 on the back of the important 
reforms underway to transform, diversify and 
grow the region’s economies. We see strong 
and growing demand to connect clients in the 
Middle East with Asia’s economies, and  
vice versa.
In contrast, Europe, including the UK, face 
challenges from higher energy prices fuelling 
inflation and necessitating higher interest 
rates, driven in part by the Russia-Ukraine  
war. All of these factors are contributing to  
a cost of living crisis and more economic 
uncertainty. We expect that any recession,  
if there is one at all, will be relatively shallow.
have peaked in the US, and there is consensus 
that the US will avoid recession. I expect the 
US to make an important contribution to 
global GDP growth in 2023.
Overall, I am optimistic about the global 
economy in the second half of 2023, but there 
is still a high level of uncertainty due to the 
Russia-Ukraine war and recessionary fears 
may yet dominate much of the year ahead. 
Navigating geopolitics remains 
challenging
The geopolitical environment remains 
challenging for our clients to navigate. There is 
sadly no end in sight to the Russia-Ukraine 
war. However, the West’s relationship with 
China appears to be relatively stable. The 
renewed, constructive dialogue between 
President Xi and President Biden at the G20  
in November was clearly important. While 
further US sanctions are expected this year, 
capital flows between China and the West 
increased during the pandemic, even with 
reciprocal tariffs in place. China is also taking 
an active approach to diplomatic engagement 
with European nations, including the UK. 
China’s reopening will also allow for the 
resumption of face-to-face visits, which will 
support greater dialogue between China and 
important partners such as Germany, France 
and the UK. We also naturally continue to 
engage with governments around the world.
One of the key trends of the past three years 
has been supply chain disruption, due largely 
to a combination of geopolitics, pandemic and 
war-related factors. Businesses are seeking to 
build greater resilience into their supply chains, 
reduce their dependence on sole suppliers or 
regions, and take the opportunity to digitise. I 
expect these trends all to continue throughout 
2023. HSBC’s global network means we are 
well placed to adapt to regional diversification 
that takes place within supply chains.
Thank you to my colleagues
Finally, my colleagues have once again shown 
great dedication, energy and care in serving 
our customers and working together over the 
past year. They have exemplified our purpose 
of ‘opening up a world of opportunity’ and our 
core values. While we want to achieve even 
more in 2023 and beyond, I am very proud of 
what they achieved in 2022 – and I am 
extremely grateful to each of them.

The most significant changes to our portfolio 
have been the exit and wind-down of 
non-strategic assets and clients in the 
Americas and Europe, and the investment

Personal Banking. We have completed the

of our banking business in Canada. We have 
also announced exits in other smaller 
businesses, including Greece and Russia.  
A key factor in assessing the strategic value  
of our businesses has been whether they 
capitalise on the distinct advantages that  
we have, especially those derived from our  
global network.
Our work to increase capital efficiency 
resulted in cumulative risk-weighted asset 
savings of $128bn by the end of 2022, in 
excess of our original target as we accelerated 
restructuring in the US and Europe. This 
enabled us to reallocate capital towards  
Asia and the Middle East.
Finally, we have transformed our cost base 
and restored tight cost discipline across the 
organisation. Our cost to achieve programme 
concluded at the end of 2022, but it enabled 
us to take multiple layers of inefficiency out  
of the business and embed changes that we 
expect to provide flow-through benefits for 
years to come.
Building a good platform for future 
growth
At the same time, we have invested in new 
sources of value creation that provide a good 
platform for future growth. Developing our 
capabilities in Wealth, particularly in Asia, has 
been a strategic priority as we have sought  
to diversify our revenues. We have done  
this organically through the build-out of our 
Pinnacle business in mainland China, and 
inorganically through the purchases of AXA 
Singapore and L&T Investment Management 
in India, by increasing our stake to 90% in 
HSBC Qianhai Securities, and by taking full 
ownership of our HSBC Life China insurance 
business. The traction that we are gaining in 
Wealth is reflected by the $80bn of net new 
invested assets that we attracted in 2022, 
$59bn of which were in Asia.

The progress that we have made over the past three years 
means that HSBC is well positioned to deliver higher returns  
and has a good platform for future growth.

We have completed the first phase of  
our transformation. Our international 
connectivity is now underpinned by good, 
broad-based profit generation around  
the world. Our focus is now on continuing 
to grow our core business, while also 
capitalising on the new sources of  
value creation that we have built. 
When we embarked on our transformation 
programme in February 2020, our aim was  
to address the fundamental issues that had 
contributed to a decade of low returns. It was 
clear to me that too much of our capital was 
being used inefficiently, too many of our 
businesses were loss-making and sub-scale, 
and too many of our clients were low returning 
and purely domestic in nature. Over the  
last three years, while responding to the 
challenges of the pandemic, we have 
structurally repositioned our businesses and 
operating model to achieve higher returns.

Group Chief Executive’s review
” The difference  
compared with three  
years ago is that  
our international 
connectivity is now 
underpinned by good 
broad-based profit 
generation around  
the world.”
Our core purpose is ‘opening up a world of 
opportunity’ and that, in essence, is what we 
do by helping our personal and corporate 
customers to move money between countries 
and do business across borders. This is still  
the best way for us to create value, and what 
makes us a world leading bank for international 
and mid-market customers. We are the 
number one trade finance bank, and trade 
revenue was up 13% in 2022, surpassing the 
good level of growth in the previous year.  
Trade also increased in all regions. 
We are also one of the leading global foreign 
exchange houses and a leading payments 
company globally, with over $600tn of 
payments processed in 2022. Our global 
connectivity has made international our 
fastest-growing revenue segment in Wealth 
and Personal Banking. Products like Global 
Money and our Wealth platforms are 
specifically designed to meet the international 
needs of our retail and wealth customers. 
These customers also provide around double 
the average revenue of domestic-only 
customers.
The difference compared with three years ago  
is that our international connectivity is now 
underpinned by good broad-based profit 
generation around the world. Already the 
leading bank in Hong Kong, we gained market 
share last year in key products including 
customer deposits, insurance and trade 
finance. We are also the leading foreign bank 
in mainland China by revenue and are pleased 
to have received seven main licence approvals 
since 2020. Our business in India delivered 
$0.9bn of profit before tax last year and 
facilitated the equivalent of around 9% of 
India’s exports. In the Middle East, we 
delivered $1.8bn of profits and were the 
number one bank in capital markets league 
tables. HSBC UK delivered $5bn of profits and 
was the number one bank for trade finance, 
while our non-ring-fenced bank in Europe 
delivered $2.1bn of profits and around 35%  
of its client business was booked outside the 
region. Our US business has now had nine 
consecutive quarters of profitability after its 
turnaround, while our business in Mexico 
delivered a return on tangible equity of 18%.
The cost savings that we have made have 
been reinvested in technology, which has in 
turn enabled us to change the way we operate 
as a business. Technology spending was 19% 
higher in 2022 than in 2019. Much of this 
investment has been used to rebuild and 
upgrade platforms, which we have then rolled 
out globally. Our upgraded mobile banking 
app is available in 24 markets and has around 
13 million active users, while our upgraded 
digital trade finance platform has been rolled 
out in the UK and Hong Kong, ensuring that 
market-leading businesses are well positioned 
for the next 10 years. In 2022, we launched 
HSBC Orion, our new proprietary tokenisation 
platform using blockchain technology for bond 
issuances. We’re also partnering with fintechs 
around the world to use their capabilities in 
our products. Finally, we are investing in 
greater automation, which we expect to  
reap the benefits from for years to come.
Empowering our people has underpinned 
everything that we have achieved over the 
past three years – and it will underpin the  
next phase of our strategy too. Reducing 
management layers has helped to increase  
our speed and agility. In our last staff survey, 
the number of colleagues who report that 
work processes allow them to work efficiently 
was 6 percentage points above the sector 
benchmark. Confidence within the 
organisation has also increased. 77% of 
colleagues told us they are confident about 
our future, which is 3 percentage points up  
on 2021. We have continued to make steady 
progress against our medium-term targets on 
gender and ethnicity representation, while  
the number of hours that colleagues spent 
learning about digital and data, and 
sustainability also increased by 13% last  
year, underlining the importance of these 
critical future skills.
The transition to net zero will offer increasingly 
significant commercial opportunities in the 
future. We have continued to make good 
progress towards our ambition of providing 
and facilitating $750bn to $1tn of sustainable 
financing and investment by 2030. At the end 
of 2022, the cumulative total for sustainable 
financing and investment since 2020 had 
reached more than $210bn. We published an 
updated energy policy, which commits us to 
no longer provide new finance or advisory 
services for the specific purpose of projects 
pertaining to new oil and gas fields and related 
infrastructure whose primary use is in 
conjunction with new fields. As per our policy, 
we will continue to provide finance to maintain 
supplies of oil and gas in line with declining 
current and future global demand, while 
accelerating our activities in support  
of clean energy. We have also set interim  
2030 targets for on-balance sheet financed 
emissions for eight sectors. These include  
six sectors for which we have reported 2019 
and 2020 emissions. We recognise that 
methodologies and data for measuring 
emissions will continue to evolve, and our  
own disclosures will therefore continue to 
develop as a result. In 2023, we will publish  
our first bank-wide climate transition plan.
Strong overall financial performance  
in 2022
The progress that we have made transforming 
HSBC and investing in growth has helped  
to drive an improved financial performance  
in 2022. A strong net interest income 
performance reflected higher global interest 
rates, but there was also good underlying 
growth across the business in key areas, 
particularly those linked to our international 
network.
Overall, the Group delivered $17.5bn of 
reported profit before tax, which was  
$1.4bn lower than in 2021. This was due to  
a net expected credit loss charge of $3.6bn 
compared with a net release of $0.9bn last 
year, as well as the impairment of $2.4bn 
relating to the planned sale of our retail 
banking operations in France. Adjusted  
profit before tax was $24bn, up $3.4bn.
Adjusted revenue was 18% higher than the 
same period last year, as net interest income 
grew strongly in all of our global businesses. 
There was also a strong performance in Global 
Foreign Exchange. Our reported return on 
tangible equity for 2022 was 9.9%. Excluding 
significant items, we delivered a return on 
tangible equity of 11.6%.

Strategic report | Group Chief Executive’s review
Future growth levers
In 2022, we continued to build new 
sources of value creation.
We brought in 
$80bn 
of net new invested assets in Wealth.
We provided and facilitated cumulatively
$210.7bn 
of sustainable finance and investment since 
January 2020.
There was a good performance across our 
global businesses. In Commercial Banking, 
adjusted profit before tax was up by 24% to 
$7.7bn, driven by revenue increases across all 
products and in all regions, most notably Asia 
and the UK. Within this, Global Payments 
Solutions revenue grew by 104% on the back 
of higher interest rates, while trade revenue 
was up 14% with growth in all regions. 
Global Banking and Markets delivered 
adjusted profit before tax of $5.4bn, up  
8% compared with 2021. Global Payments 
Solutions was again the main driver, with 
119% growth in net interest income from 
higher interest rates, and a strong 
performance in Global Foreign Exchange.  
In Wealth and Personal Banking, adjusted 
profit before tax of $8.5bn was 27% higher 
than 2021. Net interest income growth drove a 
good performance in Personal Banking, while 
there was also balance sheet growth in the 
UK, Asia outside Hong Kong, and Mexico.
We restricted adjusted cost growth to 1% in 
2022 as a result of the significant cost-saving 
actions that we have taken. This represents  
a good outcome given the high inflation 
environment. After good capital generation in 
the fourth quarter, our CET1 ratio at the end of 
2022 was 14.2% and back within our target 
range of 14% to 14.5%. We are able to pay a 
second interim dividend of $0.23 per share, 
bringing the total 2022 dividend to $0.32  
per share.
Improved returns and substantial 
distribution capacity
We are firmly on track to achieve our target  
of a return on tangible equity of at least 12% 
from 2023 onwards. We have built up a good 
level of expected credit loss provisions, and 
we also expect the headwinds associated with 
macroeconomic uncertainty and the ongoing 
challenges within the China commercial real 
estate sector to subside, enabling expected 
credit losses to start to normalise. 
There will be no easing off at all on costs.  
Our cost to achieve programme has now 
ended, but we will continue to seek and  
find opportunities to create efficiencies  
that will deliver sustainable cost savings  
in future years. We are now considering up  
to $300m of additional costs for severance  
in 2023. These costs will need to be reported 
in our costs line. Taking this into account, we 
will aim for approximately 3% cost growth  
in 2023. Tight cost discipline will remain a 
priority for the whole Group.
As a result of the improving quality of our 
returns, we are establishing a dividend payout 
ratio of 50% of reported earnings per share for 
2023 and 2024, excluding material significant 
items. We will aim to restore the dividend to 
pre-Covid-19 levels as soon as possible. We 
also intend to revert to paying quarterly 
dividends from the start of 2023. Given the 
capital generation at the end of 2022, we will 
bring forward the consideration of buy-backs 
to the announcement of our results for the  
first quarter of 2023.
Finally, subject to the completion of the  
sale of our banking business in Canada, I am 
pleased that the Board will consider payment 
of a special dividend of $0.21 per share in  
early 2024 as a priority use of the surplus 
capital generated by the transaction. We 
understand the importance of dividends to  
our shareholders and expect them to benefit 
from improved capital distributions ahead.
My colleagues are getting it done
I would like to end by thanking my colleagues 
around the world. Over the last three years, 
they have managed a period of substantial 
change, embraced the opportunities that our 
transformation has presented and gone the 
extra mile to support our customers – all while 
living through a global pandemic. More 
recently, there have also been the Russia-
Ukraine war, the real-life financial strains 
caused by high inflation and the devastating 
earthquakes in Türkiye for them to deal with. 
We have only made the progress that we have 
because of their efforts. They are exemplifying 
our value of getting it done, and I am proud to 
lead them.
Overall, 2022 was another good year for 
HSBC. We completed the first phase of  
our transformation and our international 
connectivity is now underpinned by good, 
broad-based profit generation around the 
world. This contributed to a strong overall 
financial performance. We are on track to 
deliver higher returns in 2023 and have built  
a platform for further value creation. With  
the delivery of higher returns, we will have 
increased distribution capacity, and we will 
also consider a special dividend once the  
sale of HSBC Canada is completed.

Our strategy
Our strategy
We are implementing our strategy across the four strategic pillars  
aligned to our purpose, values and ambition.
Transformation journey
We have made progress in our transformation 
in six key areas, as we start to improve 
financial performance and build a strong 
foundation for future growth. 
Capital allocation 
Asia
(as a % of Group tangible equity)1
Firstly, we have retained a market leading 
position in international connectivity. We  
are the number one trade finance bank and 
number three bank in foreign exchange 
globally, based on peer analysis undertaken  
by Coalition Greenwich. Across our global 
businesses, international connectivity is core 
to who we serve, with approximately 45% of 
our wholesale client business coming from 
cross-border relationships and approximately 
6 million international customers banking with 
Wealth and Personal Banking. International 
clients remain our most attractive client base 
in Wealth and Personal Banking, with revenue 
around double that of domestic customers. In 
addition, global transaction banking revenue,  
a cornerstone of our international connectivity, 
has grown 7% each year since 2019.
Secondly, we have also reshaped our portfolio 
through strategic exits in continental Europe 
and the Americas. We have exited our 
domestic mass market retail business in the 
US, and are in the process of selling our retail 
banking operations in France, our banking 
business in Canada, our business in Russia 
and our branch operations in Greece, subject 
to regulatory and governmental approvals.  
We have taken actions to improve the returns 
profile of the Group, including generating 
cumulative gross RWA reductions of $128bn 
since the start of our programme, exceeding 
our target of more than $110bn. We have 
continued to reallocate capital to Asia, with 
the proportion of our tangible equity allocated 
to Asia increasing to 47% at the end of 2022, 
and we remain on track with our medium- to 
long-term aspiration to increase this to 50%. 
We have also invested through a series of 
bolt-on acquisitions in Asia, including AXA’s 
business in Singapore and L&T Investment 
Management in India, and we have increased 
our stakes in HSBC Life China and  
HSBC Qianhai.

Target: >$110bn by the end of 2022.
Technology investment

(2019: $5.1bn) 
Thirdly, over the last three years we have built 
a broad and geographically diverse base of 
profit generation. We remain the leading bank 
in Hong Kong across key areas including 
deposits, lending and trade finance, while in 
mainland China, our business contributed 
$1.0bn of adjusted profit before tax in 2022, 
excluding the share of profit from our 
associate, Bank of Communications Co., 
Limited. We have also grown our businesses 
in the rest of Asia, with adjusted profit before 
tax of $4.2bn, up 24% compared with 2019. 
Outside of Asia, HSBC UK Bank plc delivered 
$5.0bn of adjusted profit before tax in 2022, 
while our HSBC Bank plc and US businesses 
have transformed into being leaner and more 
internationally focused. In the Middle East  
and North Africa, we are the leading bank in 
capital markets, while in Mexico, the return on 
average tangible equity was 18.0% in 2022. 
Fourthly, we have retained our strong focus  
on cost discipline. Within the past year, 
notwithstanding inflationary pressures, we 
contained adjusted cost growth compared 
with 2021. As a result, excluding the benefit of 
a reduced UK bank levy, adjusted costs have 
remained flat since 2019, with a 19% increase 
in technology spend offset by gross saves 
within our global businesses, operations and 
other costs. Since 2019, we have taken actions 
to become a more efficient organisation, 
reducing our office real estate footprint by 
37%, branches by 21% and operations 
headcount by approximately 11%. 
As we transformed, we have also built a 
platform for growth and returns upon which 
we will build new value creation opportunities. 
We have continued to grow our balance sheet, 
with our deposits growing by 4% and assets 
growing by 5% each year since 2019. 
Increasing fee-based revenue and growing our 
Wealth and Personal Banking franchise remain 
important priorities for the Group, and we have 
gained traction, with Wealth revenue up 3% 
and transaction banking revenue up 7% since 
2019. However, given the changes to the 
macroeconomic environment, together with 
the implementation of IFRS 17, the metrics 
‘Insurance and fees as a percentage of Group 
adjusted revenue’ and ‘WPB as a percentage 
of Group tangible equity’ are no longer 
appropriate to measure our progress in  
these areas. 
We continue to view technology as a key 
enabler of our growth ambitions, and  
have also increased our investment from 
approximately $5.1bn in 2019 to $6.1bn in 
2022. During the year, we have scaled up 
existing digital propositions and launched 
others. Details of these can be found on the 
following pages. 
Fifthly, we have supported a sustainable 
dividend policy with strong capital and 
liquidity. Finally, the above five themes have 
resulted in a strong platform for growth and 
returns, upon which we will build new value 
creation opportunities.

Strategic report | Our strategy
Delivery in 2022
Our strategy centres on four key pillars: focus on our areas of strengths, digitise at scale to adapt our operating model for the future, energise our 
organisation for growth, and support the transition to a net zero global economy.
Focus on our strengths
In our global businesses
In each of our global businesses, we continue to focus on areas where we are strongest and have opportunities to grow. 
Wealth and Personal Banking
Adjusted revenue for our Wealth and Personal 
Banking business was $24.4bn in 2022, up 
16% compared with 2021. This was driven by 
growth in Personal Banking, where adjusted 
revenue was $15.9bn, up 37%. We continued 
to make progress in executing our Wealth, 
Asset Management and Insurance strategy, 
attracting net new invested assets of $80bn, 
compared with $64bn in 2021, with $59bn 
coming from Asia. Our Asia Insurance value  
of new business reached $1.1bn, up 24%.
We continued to grow our digital propositions 
during the year. We launched Global Money in 
the UK and Australia, with the proposition now 
live in eight markets. This new proposition 
recorded approximately $11bn of transactions 
in 2022, enabling customers to make cheaper 
and faster international payments. We also 
signed up more than 900,000 users to our 
Pinnacle financial planning app to bring the 
total user base to over 1 million. 
Within our Wealth business, in partnership 
with BlackRock, we launched Prism, a hybrid 
advisory service to help investors make more 
informed investment decisions. 
$80bn
Net new invested assets in 2022.
Commercial Banking
Adjusted revenue for our Commercial Banking 
business reached $16.2bn in 2022, up 29% 
compared with 2021. Adjusted revenue rose in 
all regions, and notably in Hong Kong, which 
grew by 36%. Fee income increased by 8% to 
$3.7bn, reflecting growth in Global Payments 
Solutions and Global Trade and Receivables 
Finance.
Our digital propositions have gained 
significant traction, with payments processed 
on HSBCnet mobile increasing by nearly 62% 
during the year. Kinetic, our digital business 
banking account for SMEs in the UK, gained 
approximately 29,000 customers, taking its 
overall customer base to approximately 
53,000. Business Go, our new global digital 
platform for SMEs, has gone live and has 
grown to over 95,000 users as of 2022.  
In 2022, we launched our first Banking-as-a-
Service proposition in the US with Oracle 
Netsuite, embedding HSBC’s banking 
products within Oracle’s Cloud enterprise 
resource planning platform. 
We continue to actively help our clients with 
their climate transition goals, and have 
completed the global roll-out of our core 
sustainable product suite covering loans, trade 
finance and bonds. We also launched our 
enhanced HSBC Sustainability Tracker for 
Business Banking customers. 
Global Banking and Markets
Adjusted revenue for our Global Banking  
and Markets business was $15.4bn in 2022, 
up 10% compared with 2021, driven by  
strong performances in Global Payments 
Solutions and Markets and Securities 
Services, primarily from our Global Foreign 
Exchange business. During the year, we 
continued to drive efforts for cross-business 
line collaboration through referrals and 
cross-sell of products, with adjusted 
collaboration revenue of approximately 
$3.7bn in 2022, compared with approximately 
$3.5bn in 2021. Our Global Banking and 
Markets franchise remains an internationally 
connected one, with our clients doing 
business with us in multiple markets. In 2022, 
our clients in Europe and the Americas drove 
approximately $2.6bn of client business into 
Asia and the Middle East, an increase of 
approximately 30%.
We continued to develop our digital 
propositions with the launch of HSBC Orion,  
a new proprietary tokenisation platform to 
issue digital bonds based on distributed  
ledger technology.
We also extended our sustainable investment 
product range, launching a biodiversity 
screened equity index created in partnership 
with biodiversity data specialist Iceberg data 
lab and Euronext.

in a different geography than where the client group’s global relationship is managed. ‘Booking location’ represents the geography of the client’s entity or 
transaction booking location where this is different from where the client group’s global relationship is managed.

Our strategy
Digitise at scale
We continued to invest in our technology and 
operational capabilities to drive productivity 
across businesses and geographies, and to 
improve customer experience. In 2022, $6.1bn, 
or 20%, of our overall adjusted operating 
expenses were dedicated to technology,  
up from $5.6bn in 2021.
Enhancing our digital propositions to improve 
customer engagement and journeys remains a 
significant priority. During the year, just under 
half of our Wealth and Personal Banking 
customers were active users of our mobile 
applications, an increase from 42.7% in 2021, 
and over 75% of our Commercial Banking 
customers were active on our digital 
applications, an increase from 71.0%. 
Furthermore, in Wealth and Personal Banking, 
nearly half of sales were generated digitally. 
Our customer journeys continue to be 
transformed, for example, in Singapore, our 
Wealth and Personal Banking customers can 
now open an account even before they arrive 
in their new country via their mobile phones. 
To improve our operational efficiency, we 
continue to deploy technologies at scale in our 
organisation. Our Cloud adoption rate, which 
is the percentage of our technology services 
on the private or public Cloud, increased from 
27% to 35%.
Energise for growth 
Empowering and energising our colleagues  
is crucial for inspiring a dynamic culture. Our 
Employee engagement index, our headline 
measure of employee satisfaction, rose to 73% 
in 2022 from 67% in 2019, our baseline year. 
The participation rate of the survey also rose 
from 50% to 78%.
We remained focused on creating a diverse 
and inclusive environment, especially in senior 
leadership roles, which are those classified as 
band 3 and above in our global career band 
structure. We achieved 33.3% female 
representation in senior leadership positions 
by the end of 2022, and are on track to achieve 
our target of 35% by 2025. In 2022, we also 
set a Group-wide ethnicity strategy to better 
represent the communities we serve. We are 
on track to meet this, with 2.5% of leadership 
roles held by colleagues of Black heritage  
in 2022. 
We continued to help our colleagues develop 
future-ready skills. In 2022, the total learning 
hours spent on these future-ready skills 
(digital, data, and sustainability) increased  
to approximately 375,777 hours, up from 
334,651 hours in 2021. 
We outline how we put our purpose and 
values into practice in the following ‘ESG 
overview‘ section. 
 For further details on how we plan to energise  
for growth, see the Social section in the ESG 
review on page 73.
Transition to net zero
In November, we participated in COP27 to  
play our part in bringing together the public 
and private sector to mobilise the transition  
to a net zero global economy. We also made 
good progress on our ambitions, including 
expanding our financed emissions targets to 
eight sectors in total, reducing our greenhouse 
gas emissions, and supporting our customers 
in their transition to a net zero future including 
the launch of new climate solutions. 
Becoming a net zero bank
We continue to pursue our climate ambition  
to become net zero in our operations and 
supply chain by 2030, and align our financed 
emissions to the Paris Agreement goal of  
net zero by 2050. In 2022, we reduced our 
absolute greenhouse emissions in our 
operations to 285,000 tonnes CO2e, which 
represents a 58.5% reduction from our  
2019 baseline. 
Growth and returns
So far, we have set interim 2030 targets for 
on-balance sheet financed emissions for eight 
sectors. We also published updated energy 
and thermal coal phase-out policies during the 
year, which are important mechanisms to help 
phase down our financed emissions in these 
areas while supporting our customers in their 
own transition plans. We plan to extend our 
financed emissions analysis to new sectors – 
shipping, agriculture, commercial real estate 
and residential real estate – in future 
disclosures. We remain committed to setting 
facilitated emissions targets, and aim to 
continue to engage with industry initiatives  
to produce a consistent and comparable 
cross-industry approach. 
a total of $84.2bn of sustainable finance and 
investments, bringing our cumulative amount 
since 1 January 2020 to $210.7bn of our 
$750bn to $1tn ambition by 2030. 
Unlocking new climate solutions 
In 2022, Climate Asset Management, the 
dedicated natural capital investment manager 
formed as a joint venture with climate change 
investment and advisory firm Pollination, 
achieved commitments of more than $650m 
across its two natural capital strategies. We 
also officially launched Pentagreen, a joint 
venture with Temasek, to finance the 
development of sustainable infrastructure  
in south-east Asia. 
Supporting customers through transition
We have made progress in our ambition to 
support our customers through their transition 
to net zero. In 2022, we provided and facilitated 
 For further details on our climate ambition,  
see the Environmental section in the ESG  
review on page 46.
Looking ahead, we will continue to build on our areas of strength, using our international connectivity and strong geographical diversity 
spanning every region. We will also continue to drive our transaction banking, wealth and digital platforms in order to grow fee income. Cost 
discipline remains a priority for us, while we drive investment in technology to increase productivity and growth. As a result, we expect to 
achieve more than 12% RoTE from 2023 onwards – the highest in a decade – and have substantial distribution capacity in 2023 and 2024.

Strategic report 
ESG overview
We conduct our business to support the sustained success 
of our customers, people and other stakeholders.
Our approach
We are guided by our purpose: to open up  
a world of opportunity for our colleagues, 
customers and communities. Our purpose is 
underpinned by our values: we value difference; 
we succeed together; we take responsibility; 
and we get it done. Our purpose and values 
help us to deliver our strategy and unlock 
long-term value for our stakeholders. 
Our approach to ESG is shaped by our purpose 
and values and a desire to create sustainable 
long-term value for our stakeholders. As an 
international bank with significant breadth  
and scale, we understand that our climate, 
economies, societies, supply chains and 
people’s lives are interconnected. We recognise 
we can play an important role in tackling ESG 
challenges. We focus our efforts on three 
areas: the transition to net zero, building 
inclusion and resilience, and acting responsibly.  
Transition to net zero
The transition to net zero is one of the biggest 
challenges for our generation. Success will 
require governments, customers and finance 
providers to work together. Our global footprint 
means that many of our clients operate in 
high-emitting sectors and regions that face the 
greatest challenge in reducing emissions. This 
means that our transition will be challenging 
but is an opportunity to make an impact. 
We recognise that to achieve our climate 
ambition we need to be transparent on the 
opportunities, challenges, related risks and 
progress we make. To deliver on our ambition, 
we require enhanced processes, systems, 
controls, governance and new sources of data. 
We continue to invest in our climate resources 
and skills, and develop our business 
management process to integrate climate 
impacts. As we enhance our systems, 
processes, controls and governance, certain 
aspects of our reporting will rely on manual 
sourcing and categorisation of data. Given the 
challenges on data sourcing as well as the 
evolution of our processes as mentioned 
above, this has had an impact on certain 
climate disclosures including thermal coal. In 
2023, we will continue to review our approach 
to our disclosures, with our reporting needing 
to evolve to keep pace with market 
developments.
We set out in more detail the steps we are 
taking on our climate ambitions in the ESG 
review on page 47.
Build inclusion and resilience
Building inclusion and resilience helps us to 
create long-term value. By removing barriers 
and being a fair and equitable bank, we can 
attract the best talent, serve a wider customer 
base and support our communities.
diversity, and we focus on employee sentiment, 
and support our colleagues’ resilience through 
well-being and learning resources. 
We strive to provide inclusive and accessible 
banking for our customers. We help our 
customers to build financial resilience by 
providing resources that help them manage 
their finances, and services that help them 
protect what they value. This is critical in 
challenging times, as we continue to support 
our stakeholders in the wake of Covid-19 and 
in the face of a rising cost of living.  
Finally, we give back to our communities 
through philanthropic giving, disaster relief 
and volunteering.  
Act responsibly
We are focused on running a strong and 
sustainable business that puts the customer 
first, values good governance, and gives our 
stakeholders confidence in how we do what 
we do. Our conduct approach guides us to do 
the right thing and to focus on the impact we 
have for our customers and the financial 
markets in which we operate. Customer 
experience is at the heart of how we operate. 
We aim to act responsibly and with integrity 
across the value chain.
An inclusive, healthy and stimulating 
environment for our people helps us to succeed. 
We have set goals for gender and ethnic 
On page 16, we have set out ways that we 
have supported our stakeholders through a 
challenging year.

Supporting our customers facing a rising 
cost of living
We know that many of our customers around 
the world are facing increasing cost of living 
pressures from higher inflation, and we are 
committed to helping them.
Colleagues across our global businesses have 
been reaching out to customers to provide 
them with increased access to support, such 
as free financial health checks, as well as 
proactively contacting those who we believe 
could benefit from additional assistance.
Proactive support
We have focused our support on our 
customers in the UK, which is our largest 
market to be affected by rising cost of  
living pressures, using our guidelines  
and procedures to help provide the right 
outcomes. We also engage closely and 
regularly with our key regulators to help 
ensure we meet their expectations of financial 
institutions’ activities more generally during 
volatile markets.
For our personal customers in financial 
difficulty, we enhanced our range of digital 
resources, with the launch of a new ‘Rising 
cost of living hub’ on our public website. The 
hub provides useful articles and tools to help 
budget, manage money and gain access to 
the range of support we are providing. Other 
measures in 2022 included:
 – conducting a review of our existing tools 
and services, helping to ensure requests  
for borrowing remained affordable; 
 – helping those most in need with temporary 
support, such as reducing overdraft 
borrowing costs in eligible accounts; 
and offering extensions to collection periods. 
Other measures in 2022 included:
 – improving our customer support and 
education, including through webinars and 
our financial well-being website, to guide 
how best to improve financial resilience and 
forecast cash flows;
 – enhancing the identification of customers 
exhibiting signs of financial vulnerability, by 
using data and front-line insights provided 
from relationship management teams; 
 – providing the opportunity to mortgage 
 – increasing the education provided to our 
customers coming to the end of an existing 
fixed rate to secure a new rate earlier; and
colleagues on the various forms of financial 
support available to clients; and
 – removing the payments of penalties for 
customers in need of funds having to  
close fixed-rate savers accounts early. 
In our CMB business, our focus has been 
towards helping Business Banking clients 
exhibiting signs of financial vulnerability, as well 
as participating in local government-backed 
initiatives targeted at extending financial 
support to SMEs. When a customer is in need 
of assistance, we review on a case-by-case 
basis, with potential solutions including 
repayment holidays, extending loan repayments 
 – proactively getting in touch with customers 
to help ensure awareness of available 
support, including communicating with over 
40,000 SMEs, and increasing the number of 
outbound calls in the fourth quarter of 2022 
by 190%, when compared with the previous 
quarter, to those displaying signs of lower 
financial resilience.

responsibilities, see the ESG review on page 94.

","Mark E Tucker (Group Chairman), Noel Quinn (Group Chief Executive)","Group Chairman, Group Chief Executive","The letter notes that further COVID-19 outbreaks in Hong Kong and mainland China impacted economic growth in early 2022. However, it expresses strong optimism for 2023 due to 'China’s reopening and package of measures to stabilise the property market,' forecasting 5% GDP growth for China and a 'strong recovery' for Hong Kong and the Greater Bay Area. Geopolitically, the relationship with China appears 'relatively stable,' with constructive dialogue between President Xi and President Biden. HSBC has made significant investments in Asia, including building its Pinnacle business in mainland China, increasing its stake in HSBC Qianhai Securities, and fully owning HSBC Life China, asserting its position as the 'leading foreign bank in mainland China by revenue' with seven main licence approvals since 2020. HSBC is also adapting its global network to regional diversification in supply chains due to geopolitical factors.","Optimistic growth with strategic engagement and resilience. The sentiment is highly positive regarding China's economic outlook for 2023, driven by its reopening.

Letter to our Shareholders
Letter to our Shareholders 
We continued our transformation toward electric, digital mobility and strengthened our financial resilience 
in  fiscal  year  2022.  I  am  delighted  with  the  remarkable  effort  made  by  our  team  of  more  than  
675,000 employees. Our robust financial situation will enable us to make a strong investment in the future 
in 2023. The automotive industry will change more in the next five years than in the previous 50. In my new 
role as the Group’s CEO, I want to make our company even more successful, even more sustainable and even 
more valuable in the new era of electric and digital mobility.  
We  are  well  prepared  for  this  transformation  both  strategically  and  financially.  The  Volkswagen  Group 
achieved a solid result in 2022 and improved its profitability. And it did so in a challenging environment. Our 
continued  price  and  cost  discipline  and  improvements  in  the  mix  contributed  to  this  result.  As  a  conse-
quence, we increased our operating result before special items by €2.5 billion to €22.5 billion. Sales revenue 
rose by 11.6% to €279.2 billion thanks to improvements in the mix and in our price positioning. 
We are pleased that we can also let you, our shareholders, share in this success. The Board of Management 
and Supervisory Board propose a dividend of €8.70 per ordinary share and €8.76 per preferred share, a year-
over-year increase of €1.20 per ordinary and preferred share, respectively. 
My personal highlight in fiscal year 2022 was Porsche’s IPO. The IPO marked a historic day and Porsche is 
more independent and agile. Its new independence allows the brand to gain even more momentum. At the 
same time, the IPO brought in proceeds of around €16 billion for the Group. This means our Automotive 
Division closed fiscal year 2022 with net liquidity of €43 billion.  
One priority in the past year was to strengthen the robustness of our global operations. In view of geopolitical 
developments such as nationalism or protectionism, we will further diversify our business globally.

To our Shareholders 
Letter to our Shareholders
We  are  the  market  leader  in  Europe  and  China  and  aim  to  hold  this  position.  At  the  same  time,  we  have 
expanded  our  business  in  the  United  States  and  have  an  ambitious  growth  plan.  Local  production  of  the 
Volkswagen ID.4 has started at the plant in Chattanooga. With our newly launched Scout project, we plan to 
enter the attractive US pickup and rugged SUV market. In Canada, we have started the search for a site for a 
battery gigafactory. Growing electrification of the US automotive industry is creating the biggest strategic 
growth  opportunity  for  the  Group  in  the  market.  In  China,  we  will  continue  to  invest  in  e-mobility  and 
software.  Together  with  Horizon  Robotics,  the  Group  will  press  ahead  with  developing  driver  assistance 
systems and highly automated driving in China. 
Another priority in the past year was our company’s financial robustness. The aim is to make more efficient 
use of our capital. We are sharpening our focus on return and net cash flow. I am determined to increase the 
value of our company in a sustainable manner. That is why last year we began creating virtual equity stories 
for our brands, brand groups and value drivers in the Group. In this way we aim to make the Group’s strengths 
more visible and increase value in the long term. We will report on the initial results in the second quarter of 
2023. 
In 2022, we also took a major step forward in our transformation towards sustainable mobility, and increased 
the share of electric vehicles relative to total deliveries. Almost 7% of all the vehicles we delivered worldwide 
were powered by electricity alone. Overall, we sold 572,000 e-cars, a good 26% more than in the previous year. 
This year, we are aiming for electric vehicles to account for  around 10% of our sales. TRATON will also continue 
to push forward with the electrification of its buses and trucks.  
A faster ramp-up of e-mobility requires us to expand our battery capacities and charging networks. In 2022, 
we  pooled  our  battery  cell  manufacturing  activities  within  the  newly  established  PowerCo  battery  unit. 
Following the groundbreaking ceremony last July, our very first battery cell factory is currently being built in 
Salzgitter,  and  we  have  already  decided  on  the  locations  for  three  of  the  planned  six  battery  factories  in 
Europe. In the past fiscal year, we launched a joint venture with Enel in Italy and strengthened our partner-
ship with bp in Europe in order to expand the charging network for our customers. Alongside progress with 
our Electrify America charging network in the USA and CAMS in China, this has brought us a step closer to 
our goal of creating 45,000 fast charging points worldwide by 2025. 
Electric  mobility  is  the  greatest  lever  in  achieving  our  objective  of  net  carbon  neutrality  in  2050.  A  con-
siderable difference is also made by a more intense use of green electricity, which we already employ for the 
entire  external  power  supply  at  our  European  plants.  Furthermore,  I  am  delighted  that  the  prestigious 
Science Based Targets Initiative has honored our more stringent CO2 targets in production. We aim to reduce 
production-related CO2 emissions from our passenger cars and light commercial vehicles by 50% by 2030, an 
improvement on the initial goal of 30%.  
One of our most pressing issues last year was the reorganization of our software activities. Establishing our 
automotive software unit CARIAD was very clearly the right decision, and now we have taken CARIAD a step 
further: we have examined which core competencies we will cater for in house and where partnerships make 
more sense. We have redefined the interfaces to our brands and optimized processes and tools. Our long-
term goal continues to be the development of uniform software for the Group that allows us to fully leverage 
the economies of scale.

To our Shareholders 
Letter to our Shareholders
Last  year,  we  also  expanded  our  mobility  solutions  further  in  order  to  meet  the  mobility  needs  of  our 
customers in the best way possible both now and in the future. Together with partners, we acquired Europcar 
and  recently  launched  the  pilot  phase  of  our  new  mobility  platform  in  Vienna.  This  app  will  cover  the 
ecosystem  of  mobile  services  across  all  brands,  from  subscription  models  for  several  months,  through 
leasing, to car sharing for a few minutes. 
Together with my Board of Management team, I set out from day one to give the Volkswagen Group a new 
format.  One  that  is  strong,  robust,  resilient,  digital  and  sustainable.  In  2022,  we  took  stock  of  the  most 
important areas of action, tackled a large number of issues and made many decisions. The direction has been 
set with our new ten-point plan.  
We  will  start  implementing  the  plan  this  year  and  will  report  regularly  on  progress.  Our  goal  is  to  play  a 
leading  role  in  the  market  for  e-mobility,  too,  with  first-class  products  and  services  that  boast  persuasive 
design  and  technology,  and  a  convincing  user  experience.  We  continue  to  work  on  achieving  a  globally 
balanced presence in Europe, in China, and with a strong third pillar in North America. And we are controlling 
our  brands  and  platforms  by  means  of  binding  key  performance  indicators,  while  at  the  same  time 
promoting entrepreneurship and sustainable value creation. 
These  are  all  tasks  that  we  are  tackling  together  as  a  team.  I  warmly  invite  you  to  join  the  Board  of 
Management team and me as we implement our strategy in 2023.

Dear Fellow Shareholders,
Jamie Dimon,  
Chairman and  
Chief Executive Officer
2020 was an extraordinary year by any measure. It was a year of a global 
pandemic, a global recession, unprecedented government actions, turbulent  
elections, and deeply felt social and racial injustice. It was a year in which each of 
us faced difficult personal challenges, and a staggering number of us lost loved 
ones. It was also a year when those among us with less were disproportionately 
hurt by joblessness and poverty. And it was a time when companies discovered 
what they really were and, sometimes, what they might become. 
Watching events unfold throughout the year, we were keenly focused on what we, 
as a company, could do to serve. As I begin this annual letter to shareholders,  
I am proud of what our company and our tens of thousands of employees around 
the world achieved, collectively and individually. As you know, we have long cham-
pioned the essential role of banking in a community — its potential for bringing 
people together, for enabling companies and individuals to reach for their dreams, 
2

--- Page 5 ---
and for being a source of strength in difficult times. Those opportunities were 
powerfully presented to us this year, and I am proud of how we stepped up.  
I discuss these themes later in this letter. 
As I look back on the last year and the last two decades — starting from my time 
as CEO of Bank One in 2000 — it is remarkable how much we persevered and have 
accomplished, not only in terms of financial performance but also in our stead-
fast dedication to help clients, communities and countries throughout the world. 
2020 was another strong year for JPMorgan Chase, with the firm generating record 
revenue, as well as numerous other records in each of our lines of business. We 
earned $29.1 billion in net income on revenue of $122.9 billion versus $36.4 billion 
on revenue of $118.5 billion in 2019, reflecting strong underlying performance across 
our businesses offset by additional reserves under new accounting rules. We gener-
ally grew market share across our businesses and continued to make significant 
investments in products, people and technology, all while maintaining credit  
discipline and a fortress balance sheet. In total, we extended credit and raised  
$2.3 trillion in capital for businesses, institutional clients and U.S. customers.
JPMorgan Chase stock is owned by large institutions, pension plans, mutual funds 
and directly by individual investors. However, it is important to remember that 
in almost all cases, the ultimate beneficiaries are the individuals in our commu-
nities. More than 100 million people in the United States own stock, and a large 
percentage of these individuals, in one way or another, own JPMorgan Chase stock. 
Many of these people are veterans, teachers, police officers, firefighters, health-
care workers, retirees or those saving for a home, school or retirement. Your 
management team goes to work every day recognizing the enormous responsibility 
that we have to perform for our shareholders. 
While we don’t run the company worrying about the stock price in the short run, in 
the long run our stock price is a measure of the progress we have made over the 
years. This progress is a function of continual investments in our people, systems 
and products, in good and bad times, to build our capabilities. Whether looking

These charts show actual returns of the stock, with dividends reinvested, for heritage shareholders of Bank One and JPMorgan Chase & Co. 
vs. the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (S&P 500 Index) and the Standard & Poor’s Financials Index (S&P Financials Index).
1  On March 27, 2000, Jamie Dimon was hired as CEO of Bank One.
back over five years, 10 years or since the JPMorgan Chase/Bank One merger 
(approximately 15 years ago), these investments mean our stock has significantly 
outperformed the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and the Standard & Poor’s  
Financials Index. These important investments will also drive our company’s  
future prospects and position it to grow and prosper for decades.
We have consistently described to you, our shareholders, the basic principles and 
strategies we use to build this company — from maintaining a fortress balance 
sheet, constantly investing, nurturing talent, fully satisfying regulators, and  
continually improving risk, governance and controls to serving customers and 
clients while lifting up communities worldwide. 
Adhering to these principles allows us to drive good organic growth and prop-
erly manage our capital (including dividends and stock buybacks), which we have 
consistently demonstrated over the past decades. All of this is shown in the charts 
in this introduction. In addition, we urge you to read the CEO letters in this Annual 
Report, which will give you a lot more specific detail about our businesses and what 
our plans are for the future.

If you look deeper, you will find that our success and accomplishments are founded 
on our commitment to our shareholders. Shareholder value can be built only if you 
maintain a healthy and vibrant company, which means doing a good job taking care 
of your customers, employees and communities. Conversely, how can you have a 
healthy company if you neglect any of these stakeholders? As we have learned in 
2020, there are myriad ways an institution can demonstrate its compassion for its 
employees and its communities while still upholding shareholder value.
Ultimately, the basis of our success is our people. They are the ones who serve our 
customers and communities, build the technology, make the strategic decisions, 
manage the risks, determine our investments and drive innovation. Whatever your 
view is of the world’s complexity and the risks and opportunities ahead, having a 
great team of people — with guts and brains and enormous capabilities who can 
navigate personally challenging circumstances while dedicating themselves to 
professional excellence — is what ensures our prosperity, now and in the future.

Within this letter, I discuss the following:
I.   The Corporate Citizen: The Purpose of a Corporation 
1.  Businesses must earn the trust of their customers and communities by 
acting ethically and morally.
2.  Being a responsible community citizen locally is critical, and it is easy to 
understand why.
3.  Being a responsible community citizen nationally, or globally, is more 
critical and more complex.  
II.   Lessons from Leadership
1. 
Enforce a good decision-making process.
2.  Examine raw data and focus on real numbers.
3.  Understand when analysis is necessary and when it impedes change.
4.  Before conducting an important analysis, assess all relevant factors 
involved. 
5.  Always deal with reality.
6.  Remain open to learning how to become a better leader. 
III.  Banks’ Enormous Competitive Threats — from Virtually Every Angle
1.  Banks are playing an increasingly smaller role in the financial system.
2.  The growth in shadow and fintech banking calls for level playing field 
regulation.
3.  AI, the cloud and digital are transforming how we do business.
4.  Fintech and Big Tech are here … big time!
5. 
JPMorgan Chase is aggressively adapting to new challenges.

IV.  Specific Issues Facing Our Company
1. 
Cyber risk remains a significant threat.
2.  Brexit was finally accomplished — but uncertainties linger.
3.  New accounting requirements affect reserve reporting but not how we run our 
business.
4.  While we disbanded Haven, we will continue to build on what we learned. 
V.   COVID-19 and the Economy
Page 32
Page 32
Page 32
Page 33
Page 34 
Page 35
1.  Bold action by the Fed and the U.S. government effectively reversed financial panic.
Page 35
2.  Banks entered this recent crisis in great shape and were part of the solution 
coming out.
3.  The confusing interplay of monetary, fiscal and regulatory policy continues 
through recessions.
4.  The regulatory system needs to keep up with the changing world — and finish 
Dodd-Frank to get it right.
5.  The pandemic accelerated remote working capabilities, which will likely  
carry forward. 
VI.  Public Policy 
American Exceptionalism, Competitiveness and Leadership: Challenged by 
China, COVID-19 and Our Own Competence
1. 
Laying out the problems is painful. 
2.  Why did — and didn’t — these failures happen? 
3.  We need a comprehensive, multi-year national Marshall Plan, and we must strive 
for healthy growth.
4.  We need to take specific action steps.
5.  America’s global role and engagement are indispensable to the health and  
well-being of America.

 Toyota in 10 Years and 100 Years [1 of 6]   
 Our DNA is Creating Ever-Better Cars   
 What Sets Toyota Apart   
 Enriching Lives and Building Tomorrow’s Toyota through Innovation   
 New Values for the Next Hundred Years   
 Message from the Executive Vice President Responsible for Accounting
Toyota in 10 Years and 100 Years
With the goal of making ever-better cars, the Toyota Global Vision is an articulation of the kind of company we want to be. It is based on shared values and a spirit of monozukuri (conscientious manufactur-
ing) passed down since our foundation and embodied in the core values of Sakichi Toyoda, the Guiding Principles at Toyota, and the Toyota Way. We use the image of a tree to illustrate our vision: the roots 
are our shared values; the ongoing upward growth of its branches represents our efforts to expand business; the fruit represents making ever-better cars and enriching lives and local communities; and the 
trunk is our stable base of business. As the trunk of the tree grows bigger and stronger, it is able to support more branches—the creation of ever-better cars. This is the trajectory that puts Toyota on the 
path toward sustainable growth.

Environmental concerns must be taken into 
account when we think about creating a “mobility 
society” (that is, a highly mobile society reliant on 
automobiles as its major means of transporta-
tion). The Guiding Principles at Toyota, set forth in 
January 1992, declared that we will “dedicate our 
business to providing clean and safe products 
and to enhancing quality of life everywhere through 
all of our activities.” In line with this principle, in 
December 1997, Toyota launched the world’s first 
mass-produced hybrid vehicle, the Prius.
  The environment is still a top-priority manage-
ment issue. In addition to hybrid vehicles, Toyota 
has been developing next-generation eco cars, 
including plug-in hybrid vehicles, electric vehicles, 
and fuel cell vehicles. Believing that the spread of 
eco cars is in itself good for the environment, 
Toyota has focused on hybrid vehicles, selling 
more than six million in total as of December 
2013. Although it took nine years and nine 
months for cumulative sales to reach the one 
million mark in May 2007, strengthening demand 
has accelerated the popularization of hybrids. 
After passing the four million mark in April 2012, it

  Based on the concept of producing the optimal 
vehicle in the optimal location at the optimal time, 
Toyota has broadened its hybrid lineup and now 
offers at least one in each automobile category. 
We believe hybrids have finally entered a full-scale 
growth phase and are no longer niche products.
  Toyota calculates that as of December 31, 2013, 
use of Toyota hybrids* had resulted in approxi-
mately 41 million fewer tons of CO2 emissions** 
than would have been emitted by gasoline-powered 
vehicles of similar size and driving performance. 
Toyota also estimates that the use of its hybrid 
vehicles has saved approximately 15 million kiloli-
ters of gasoline compared with the amount that 
would have been used by gasoline-powered vehi-
cles of similar size. Hybrid vehicles offer lower CO2 
emissions and lower fossil fuel consumption.
  As of the end of August 2014, Toyota has 27 
hybrid models and one plug-in hybrid model on 
the market in about 80 countries and regions. 
Furthermore, within the next two years (2014 and 
2015), we plan to launch a total of 15 new hybrid 
models worldwide. Taking advantage of our 
pioneer status, we will continue adding to this 
lineup and increasing the number of countries and 
regions where we sell hybrids, with the ultimate 
aim of popularizing eco cars around the world.

Further advances in key technologies  
for hybrid technology
Hybrid technology can be applied to the develop-
ment of all sorts of environment-friendly vehicles 
and can be found in a wide variety of powertrains. 
Toyota has positioned hybrid technology as a 
core environmental technology for the 21st 
century. As a pioneer in the mass production of 
hybrid vehicles, we are continuing to improve this 
technology.
  Power semiconductors have a big impact on 
the effectiveness of hybrid technology. Hybrid 
systems offer excellent fuel economy through the 
efficient use of two power sources: gasoline 
engines and electric motors. A large number of 
power semiconductors are used in the power 
control unit (PCU), a device situated between the 
motor, power generator and batteries. The PCU 
controls the output of the motor. Some of the 
electrical current that flows through the power 
semiconductors in the PCU is lost as heat; in fact, 
approximately 20% of a hybrid vehicle’s overall 
electricity loss is from the power semiconductors. 
PCU volume: 1/5
PCU with silicon power  
semiconductors  
(Production model) 
The PCU plays a vital role in controlling electricity usage, 
recharging batteries with electricity generated when the 
vehicle decelerates and accelerating the vehicle by supply-
ing electricity to motors from the battery bank while driving.
PCU with SiC power  
semiconductors 
(Future target)
For this reason, making power semiconductors 
more efficient will improve fuel economy. Toyota 
has been developing its own power semiconduc-
tors as a key technology for improving fuel econ-
omy since the launch of its first-generation Prius 
in 1997. In the latest, third-generation Prius, elec-
tricity loss has been reduced to a quarter of that 
of the first-generation Prius.
  Aiming to make tomorrow’s Toyota better than 
today’s, we are developing power semiconductors 
that use next-generation silicon technology, namely, 
silicon carbide (SiC), a material that is a compound 
of silicon and carbon. We have already improved 
fuel economy more than 5%* in a prototype 
featuring the new SiC power semiconductors. As 
early as possible, Toyota aims to commercialize 
SiC power semiconductors that offer a 10%* 
improvement in fuel economy through greater 
 efficiency. In addition, we aim to shrink the PCU 
to one-fifth the size of current PCUs through 
the use of SiC power semiconductors.

Building the right cars in  
the right places
Over half a century has passed since Toyota 
exported its first two Crowns to North America in 
1957, and it has been almost 30 years since 
Toyota started building cars in North America, 
beginning with New United Motor Manufacturing, 
Inc., in 1986.
  Through the 1980s, Toyota was well known as 
a maker of mid-sized and compact passenger 
cars, such as the Camry and Corolla, as well as 
the Hilux small pickup truck. In 1989, Toyota 
launched the Lexus brand as its entry into the 
luxury passenger car market. From that point 
onward, it expanded its lineups of luxury vehicles 
and cars for young drivers as well as light-duty 
trucks, and introduced hybrid models, changing 
its image as a carmaker and increasing its pres-
ence in the U.S. market.
  Cumulative production volume in North 
America reached 10 million vehicles in 2001, 20 
million vehicles at the end of 2008, and 25 million 
vehicles in October 2012. In May 2014, Toyota’s 
plant in Kentucky, which started production in 
May 1988, became the first Toyota plant outside 
Japan to have produced 10 million vehicles.
  Today, in the United States and Canada, Toyota 
has 11* manufacturing companies, three distribu-
tors, and a network of more than 1,750 dealers 
that sell more than two million Toyota and Lexus 
vehicles annually.
In our quest to innovate and make tomorrow’s 
Toyota even better than today’s, we have decided 
to establish a new North American headquarters, 
moving our regional manufacturing, sales and 
marketing, corporate, and financial services head-
quarters to a single location in Plano, Texas. The 
move is intended to increase efficiency and 
collaboration throughout the organization, with 
the ultimate aim of ensuring sustained growth in 
North America by creating a business structure 
that allows us to deliver ever-better cars to 
customers.
  Ahead of this strengthening of our business 
foundation and in line with our principle of build-
ing the right cars in the right places, we have 
assigned an American as the chief engineer over-
seeing the redesign of the flagship Camry model. 
Cumulative production volume at Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky has reached 10 million vehicles.
Under his guidance, and based on intricate market 
research, the Camry has evolved into a car with 
bold form and solid handling.

Fuel cell vehicles: ideal eco cars
Automobiles can be powered by a wide range of 
energy sources, including gasoline, diesel, natural 
gas, synthetic liquid fuel, biofuel, electricity, and 
hydrogen. Two strategies are being taken to 
address environmental problems caused by the 
mass consumption of fossil fuels: using less 
petroleum and diversifying energy sources. 
Combining high thermal efficiency, low fuel 
consumption engines and a host of advanced 
 pollution. In addition to producing zero emissions 
when driven, fuel cell vehicles are also highly prac-
tical. Their defining characteristic is their long cruis-
ing range. They can also be refueled very quickly.
  As a source of electrical power during emer-
gencies, a fuel cell vehicle is capable of powering 
a typical home for roughly a week. Because of 
their simultaneous achievement of zero emissions 
and high practicality, Toyota positions these vehi-
cles as the ultimate eco-car.
  However, one barrier to the proliferation of fuel 
cell vehicles is the need to create a refueling 
 infrastructure in the form of hydrogen stations. To 
ensure that our customers are able to operate 
fuel cell vehicles reliably, Toyota is cooperating in 
the establishment and operation of a hydrogen 
supply infrastructure in numerous countries and 
regions around the world.
  We have more than two decades of experience 
with fuel cell vehicles; we started development in 
1992 and launched the Toyota FCHV, the world’s 
first fuel cell SUV, in December 2002 on a limited 
basis in Japan and the United States. Toyota has 
developed a proprietary fuel cell stack and

leading levels.
  Toyota plans to start selling a fuel cell sedan in 
Japan before March 2015. At first, the new vehi-
cle will be sold only in major cities that plan to 
build hydrogen station networks. We are also 
preparing to launch the sedan in the United 
States and Europe around summer 2015. From 
the 2020s onward, we expect the market for fuel 
cell vehicles to increase significantly, with several 
tens of thousands of vehicles sold per year.
  Over the next 100 years, we believe electrified 
powertrains will hold the key to the future of the 
automobile. The first-generation Prius opened the 
door to this future in 1997, and a new era of 
transportation emerged once major challenges 
were overcome. Similarly, fuel cell vehicles repre-
sent the next stage in the development of a future 
“mobility society.” Toyota has embarked on a long 
journey toward making hydrogen an everyday fuel 
and fuel cell vehicles the norm.

 Message from the Executive Vice President Responsible for Accounting
Our DNA is Creating Ever-Better Cars
Toyota aims to deliver cars that open up new 
lifestyles for consumers, cars that change 
lives for the better and bring new discoveries. 
As we strive to do this, our ideals and pride in 
manufacturing are evident at every stage, 
from development through production and 
sales, and ensuring the performance and 
quality of every car we make.
  Toyota believes that cars are more than a 
means of transportation, being a source of 
excitement and exhilaration. At Toyota, we 
foster human resources to ensure that our 
DNA is passed on to future generations so 
that we can continue to sustainably create 
truly great cars.
Inherited expertise in manufacturing put 
to the test at world-class contests
Toyota’s competitiveness is derived from its 
manufacturing expertise and the passing on of 
this expertise to the next generation. Toyota 
participates in the WorldSkills Competition, which 
tests the competence of young employees (the 
under 22s), to create opportunities for the voca-
tional workers at the core of our operations to 
build on their abilities and learn advanced tech-
niques. Held once every two years since 1950, 
this international contest aims to encourage voca-
tional mastery, foster exchange among people of 
various nationalities, and nurture appreciation for 
technical workmanship. At the 42nd WorldSkills 
Competition held in Leipzig, Germany, in July 
2013, 1,007 competitors represented 53 coun-
tries and regions in 46 vocational skills. Eight 
employees from Toyota competed in seven voca-
tions, with two being awarded gold medals and 
all eight contestants receiving prizes. Toyota was 
responsible for two of the five gold medals won 
by Japan. Over the years, Toyota has won a total 
of 25 gold medals, 13 silver medals, and 9 bronze 
medals at this international contest.
In addition, four employees of Toyota in 
Thailand and Indonesia participated in two voca-
tional fields, taking home one gold medal and two 
silver medals. A culture emphasizing vocational 
skills has taken hold at our bases overseas. The 
Next WorldSkills Competition is slated for São 
Paulo, Brazil, in August 2015.
  The National Skills Competition has been held 
in Japan annually since 1963. Toyota has partici-
pated since 1966, and currently enters the 
competition in 10 vocational fields related to auto-
motive manufacturing. The 52nd National Skills 
Competition will be held in November 2014 in 
Toyota’s home prefecture of Aichi, with more than 
1,200 participants from across the country, 
including 43 young Toyota technicians, compet-
ing for the distinction of best technique in the 
country. The gold medalists will represent Japan 
at the next international competition in Brazil.
Creative skill use to make ever-better cars
At Toyota’s Takaoka Plant, production lines are 
occasionally referred to as “skill inheritance lines.” 
The production floor is a place where younger 
workers can learn craftsmanship as well as the 
rules and principles of manufacturing. These 
production lines were created with a sense of 
urgency, because we thought that opportunities

  The body remembers the experience of build-
ing something. When an issue arises, the experi-
ence can be drawn on to quickly get to the root 
of the problem through a cyclical process of 
hypothesis and verification. These advanced, 
hard-earned skills are reflected in production 
technologies, and through a constant evolution 
and sharpening of skills and technologies, a spiral 
of improvement leads to innovation.
  To reinforce its foundation for creating ever-
better cars, Toyota launched an initiative last year 
wherein young workers come into direct contact 
with how customers around the world use Toyota 
vehicles in various transportation environments. 
These young engineers, who were mostly 
dispatched to our overseas R&D centers, 
conducted surveys of market conditions, evalu-
ated local conditions, and participated in develop-
ment. The knowledge they gained through these 
experiences will help us create the ever-better 
cars of the future.
Knowledge and skills from the grueling 
world of motorsport go into making  
ever-better cars
For many years, Toyota has tested its vehicles on 
the race circuit in Nürburgring, Germany, which is 
regarded as the world’s most grueling course. 
With the aim of fostering human resources able to 
make ever-better cars, Toyota has taken this a 
step further and has participated in the 24 Hours 
of Nürburgring endurance race since 2007. The 
over-25-kilometer course combines the 
Nürburgring (North Loop) and the GP Course 
used by the F1 Grand Prix. Since 2012, Toyota 
has sent its “skill inheritance team” of mechanics 
comprising young employees with expertise in a 
variety of fields.
  Nürburgring features intense elevation changes 
of up to 300 meters on a course laid out like 
European public roads, complete with rough 
patches. During the race, the car design is tested 
and seasoned as the team members address 
unexpected problems that arise, with the group 
becoming closely attuned to the car and group 
cohesion strengthening. In an intense and short 
period, participants gain a profound appreciation 
of automobiles and a level of know-how and skill-
fulness that transcends their daily work. At our 
eighth appearance at the competition, 14 
mechanics from Toyota participated. Toyota won 
in the SP3 class, SP8 class, and the SP-PRO 
class, and the Toyota team finished in the best 
position with the highest number of laps it has 
ever accomplished.
  As Toyota manufacturing spreads globally, as 
the spirit of innovation is passed along at work-
places around the world, and as technologies 
and skills evolve, our DNA will continue to be 
passed on for not only the next 10 years but the 
next 100 years.

 New Values for the Next Hundred Years

What Sets Toyota Apart
>  The improvement process is infinite, and 
Kaizen (continuous improvement)
Toyota has grown from a single core concept 
that is still shared by the entire Group: contrib-
uting to society by making ever-better cars.
  Some of the values and ideas that have 
defined Toyota over its 75-year history are 
listed below.
The Toyota Production System (TPS)
TPS encourages the complete elimination of 
waste, irregularities, and overburdening from 
the production process. The system, originally 
employed in the textile industry, is based on two 
fundamental concepts: jidoka, which can be 
loosely translated as “automation with a human 
touch,” and the Just-in-Time (JIT) principle. Under 
these concepts, if a problem occurs, the equip-
ment immediately stops running, preventing the 
manufacture of defective products, and at each 
stage production is limited to only what is needed, 
when it is needed, and in the amount needed.
>  Establish the facts through genchi genbutsu 
(on-site, hands-on experience)
>  Stop production lines when a problem 
occurs and implement corrective and 
improvement measures
The Nature of the Toyota Production System
after-the-fact improvements are in essence 
forward-looking improvements
These directives, which form part of Toyota’s 
management philosophy, are by no means limited 
to the production front-line. They apply universally 
to all endeavors. In effect, TPS represents the 
building blocks of Toyota’s human resource 
 development endeavors.
Genchi Genbutsu 
(on-site, hands-on experience)
The genchi genbutsu principle refers to much 
more than merely visiting a site to examine some-
thing in situ. It entails understanding and respect-
fully considering the opinions of on-site individuals 
as well as of individuals who have extensive rele-
vant knowledge. Genchi genbustu is thus a key 
concept in the improvement process. Furthermore, 
the notion of “respect for people” is consistent 
with Toyota’s founding philosophy, and is under-
pinned by the concept of thoroughgoing and 
direct communication.
Kaizen (continuous 
improvement)
Take a close look at each site
Consistently uncover issues

Building “true competitiveness”
To consistently deliver a higher level of quality and 
competitive products to its customers, Toyota 
must continue to nurture a corporate culture that 
places the utmost value on quality, productivity, 
and cost efficiency. In addition to an unwavering 
commitment to JIT that underscores our commit-
ment to the development of a short and efficient 
supply chain, we realize that we must also 
provide customers with a wide-ranging, compre-
hensive, and well-organized after-sales service 
network. From a long-term perspective, we can 
only stay competitive if we continue to focus on 
developing human resources, fostering relation-
ships of trust between management and labor, 
and ensuring that each employee remains 
committed to conscientious manufacturing. 
For its part, Toyota will continue to hone its true 
competitiveness, which provides the underlying 
strength for its manufacturing platform over the 
medium to long term. By doing so, we hope to 
ensure sustainable growth.
Representing a never-ending cycle of progress, the 
word kaizen encapsulates a spirit of striving for 
continuous improvement and a refusal to accept the 
idea that something cannot be made better. Toyota 
believes that acknowledging the possibility of contin-
uous improvement can make tasks easier and more 
enjoyable. From an organizational standpoint, kaizen 
involves the entire workforce while relying on the 
extensive knowledge, skills, and experience of the 
people working directly on the process. The concept 
is based on individuals taking ownership of their 
work and focusing on what should be done rather 
than on what can be done. At the same time, the 
kaizen process is underpinned by thoroughgoing 
and direct communication. It is essential to follow 
through once a decision has been made upon 
thorough deliberation with the participation of all. 
We consider this a valuable part of our corporate 
culture. Taiichi Ohno (1912-1990), a former Toyota 
executive vice president and founder of the Toyota 
Production System, once commented that while the 
wisdom of humankind was infinite, that wisdom 
tended to emerge only during periods of adversity. 
When things are not going well and a better method 
is discovered, it is critical that  suggestions be made 
openly, discussed, and put into practice to ensure 
continuous improvement.

 Our DNA is Creating Ever-Better Cars   
 What Sets Toyota Apart   
 Enriching Lives and Building Tomorrow’s Toyota through Innovation [1 of 4]   
 New Values for the Next Hundred Years   
 Message from the Executive Vice President Responsible for Accounting
Enriching Lives and Building Tomorrow’s Toyota through Innovation 
Toyota aims to enrich lives and communities through innovations that make cars safer, more comfortable and more convenient. This will help create a future “Smart Mobility Society” in which cars are highly 
economical and energy efficient.
Safety in a “Smart Mobility Society”
To realize a safe and responsible automobile soci-
ety, Toyota has been developing safety technolo-
gies based on an “Integrated Safety Management 
Concept,” that involves a three-pronged, compre-
hensive approach to passengers, cars and trans-
portation systems, in pursuit of a practical safety 
strategy with the ultimate aim of zero traffic fatali-
ties and injuries. For Toyota, the “Integrated Safety 
Management Concept” is synonymous with vehi-
cle safety. To make cars safer, we concentrate on 
integrating safety systems, instead of having them 
function independently of each other.
  Vehicle-infrastructure cooperative systems use 
ITS (Intelligent Transport Systems) technology to 
establish car-to-car, car-to-pedestrian, and car-to-
road connections. These systems help prevent 
accidents and support safe driving environments 
by alerting drivers to pertinent information 
provided by roadside sensors and other vehi-
cles—information that is unobtainable using a 
single vehicle’s sensors alone. Toyota aims to 
make vehicle-infrastructure cooperative systems a 
reality as soon as possible, and has been working 
with government institutions to create standards 
for smart road infrastructure to upgrade the trans-
portation environment. We have been conducting 
field tests on public roads since 2006 in collabora-
tion with government agencies and other private-
sector companies. Moreover, by the mid-2010s, 
we intend to be the first company in the world to 
commercialize systems that use the 700 MHz 
band to establish connections between people 
and cars to support safe driving environments. We 
aim to create advanced driving safety systems by 
linking the automated safety systems of vehicles.

income, as adjusted, each by 3% in 2015, despite more 
than $150 billion of negative foreign exchange impact and 
market depreciation on our assets under management. 
We generated industry-leading organic asset growth 
of 4% through $152 billion of long-term net inflows, 
maintained a stable operating margin, as adjusted, at  
42.9% while continuing to invest in our business 
in a challenging market environment and returned 
approximately $2.6 billion of capital to our shareholders, 
representing a total payout ratio of 77%. 
While our long-term value-creation 
framework has remained consistent 
over the past several years,  
we are constantly evaluating the 
ecosystem in which we operate  
to identify areas that might require 
us to pivot our strategy.  
Organic growth was the result of global client demand 
for both active and index solutions across asset 
classes and across regions.
We saw $61 billion of net inflows in active and $92 billion 
in index & iShares. 
We constantly strive to improve our active performance 
and, in 2015, we continued to invest in our team and 
capabilities to build the industry’s most durable alpha-
generating franchise. 
Flows into active products in 2015 were driven by the 
strength of our active performance. At year end, 91% of 
our active taxable fixed income assets and 90% of our 
scientific active equity assets were above benchmark or 
peer median for the three-year period. Our fundamental 
active equity business benefited from our efforts to 
reinvigorate and globalize the team, generating strong 
returns for our clients, with 76% of assets above 
benchmark or peer median for the one-year period.
We raised $39 billion of net inflows in Retail, $130 billion 
in iShares and $27 billion in Institutional Active, offset  
by $43 billion in low-fee Institutional Index outflows. 
In Retail, we manage more than $540 billion on behalf  
of clients and have significant room to increase 
our share of global distribution. We are enhancing 
distribution by harnessing our technological 
advantages, building on existing strength with 
integrated wealth management firms and leveraging 
our differentiated platform to increase our presence 
in the fast-growing Registered Investment Advisor 
channel. We continually evolve our product set to 
ensure we have both the active and index strategies  
our clients need to achieve desired outcomes, and  
we continue to invest in the BlackRock brand. 
As ETF adoption spreads, we are forecasting global ETF  
assets to double to $6 trillion over the next five years. 
Growth in iShares will be driven by the growth of the 
overall market — via new product uses and deeper and 
broader adoption across client segments. 
Across our Institutional Client base, we remain focused 
on further deepening relationships, and 53% of our  
largest institutional clients now have five or more products 
with BlackRock. Using strategies across our diverse 
platform, we create multi-asset, hybrid solutions  
to solve our clients’ most complex investment needs. 
We leverage the analytical capabilities of Aladdin, 
our proprietary risk management and operational 
platform, as well as the advisory capabilities of our 
Client Solutions and Financial Markets Advisory teams 
to provide the guidance our clients need to achieve 
their long-term objectives. 
Across client types, we generated $53 billion of net 
inflows in equity, $77 billion in fixed income, $17 billion 
in multi-asset and $5 billion in alternatives.
And the global and diverse nature of our platform is 
resonating with clients, as we achieved net inflows  
in excess of $1 billion in each of 13 countries, and a record 
65 Retail and iShares funds each generated more than 
$1 billion of net inflows for the year. 
BlackRock’s diverse platform enables us to generate 
stable cash flow through market cycles, which 
positions us to invest for the long term. If we continue to 
distinguish ourselves from our competitors — especially 
in terms of organic growth — and strike an appropriate 
balance between investing for future growth and 
practical discretionary expense management, we will 
continue to deliver value for our shareholders. 
ADDRESSING CHANGES IN THE INVESTMENT 
L ANDSCAPE: IMPACT ON OUR CLIENTS AND  
OUR BUSINESS 
BlackRock’s ability to create value for shareholders 
depends on our ability to understand, anticipate and 
adapt ahead of changes to the ecosystem in which  
we operate. 
Markets have struggled to digest the dramatic shift 
in the cost of energy over the past 18 months. 
Producers, exporters, equipment suppliers and other 
sector participants have suffered, but we have yet  
to see a noticeable uptick in spending as consumers 
pay less at the pump. Markets are also weighed down 
by oil-producing nations selling securities to meet 
liquidity needs. 
In China, the waning construction boom has left a lasting 
impact on real estate values and bank balance sheets, 
raising questions on how the country will fuel future 
growth. Sell-offs in the Chinese markets and inconsistent 
policy responses have heightened investor frustration 
and uncertainty and threatened global growth.

2019 Financial Performance
In 2019, the global economy experienced broad-based 
growth, inflation was subdued and unemployment fell  
to multi-year lows in key regions, while the outlook for 
economic growth and geopolitical risk was closely 
monitored throughout the year. At Goldman Sachs,  
our businesses weathered pockets of market volatility 
and delivered strong performance into year end. Our 
enduring focus on our clients and our culture of 
excellence drove solid financial results. Net revenues  
were $36.55 billion for the year and return on average 
common shareholders’ equity was 10.0 percent. We 
remained the industry’s leading mergers and acquisitions 
advisor, and held the #1 position in worldwide equity 
and equity-related offerings and common stock  
offerings for the year. 
Our businesses generally produced strong net revenues, 
and the growth we achieved in new initiatives such as our 
consumer banking business was encouraging. Investment 
Banking generated net revenues of $7.60 billion, its 
second highest annual net revenues. In Global Markets, 
our broad and diverse franchise across FICC and Equities 
delivered net revenues of $14.78 billion, reflecting 
growing financing revenues. Asset Management produced 
solid results, with net revenues of $8.97 billion, amid 
strong asset inflows; net revenues in Equity investments 
continue to be robust and rose versus 2018. Rapidly 
scaling Consumer & Wealth Management generated 
record net revenues of $5.20 billion. Firmwide assets 
under supervision increased during the year to a  
record $1.86 trillion.
Our Purpose and Core Values
We believe that shareholders and stakeholders alike 
expect companies to explain their purpose and  
core values. Goldman Sachs’ mission is to advance 
sustainable economic growth and financial opportunity 
across the globe. Drawing upon over 150 years of 
experience working with the world’s leading businesses, 
entrepreneurs, and institutions, we mobilize our people 
and resources to advance the success of our clients, 
broaden individual prosperity and accelerate economic 
2 
Goldman Sachs 2019 Annual Report
progress for all. If we successfully deliver on this purpose, 
we are confident that we will also succeed in delivering 
significant value to our shareholders. 
We are taking our foundational strengths and applying 
them as we invest in our future. This means affirming  
our values while fostering change and innovation. As 
part of that effort, we distilled our business principles 
into four core values that inform everything we do. First 
is the partnership ethos which is central to Goldman 
Sachs’ culture. I’m referring not just to our firm’s 
leadership group, the partners of Goldman Sachs, but 
also to the philosophy behind our client relationships and 
the way we interact with our stakeholders. Partnership 
fosters a sense of ownership and stewardship that is truly 
unique and differentiated. It encourages collaboration, 
inclusivity, and teamwork, and it inspires our people to 
always put our clients at the center of everything we do.
Of course, putting our clients at the center requires 
exceptional client service, which is our second core  
value. Having personally spent decades building deep 
relationships with clients, I can attest to the results we 
can achieve through long-term dedication to client 
service. This goes beyond transactional excellence. The 
connectivity to our people — our ability to offer advice, 
knowledge, and feedback — is often the most significant 
driver of value.
As Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, I am intensely 
focused on integrity. We must have an unrelenting 
commitment to doing the right thing — always. 
Particularly in the wake of our experience in Malaysia,  
I am keenly aware of how the actions of a few can harm 
our firm. We will continue to assess ways to learn and 
improve from this experience, and we are committed to 
ensuring our culture of integrity remains a core value. 
Finally, excellence. We are committed to delivering to  
the very best of our ability. This value permeates our 
organization from the bottom to the top. It informs  
the kind of people we attract, the advice we give, and  
the ways in which we strive to exceed our clients’ 
expectations. Every day, I see examples of the people  
of Goldman Sachs going the extra mile, working to 
execute at the highest level possible.

Our Competitive Strengths
Today, Goldman Sachs possesses an enviable portfolio  
of market-leading businesses. Foundational to our 
success are a number of self-reinforcing competitive 
strengths within these businesses. First, we firmly believe 
our biggest competitive strength is the exceptional talent 
of our people. I frequently hear from clients that our 
people differentiate us from the competition, and I see  
it firsthand. Goldman Sachs has developed an ecosystem 
that attracts and develops top talent from across the 
globe, giving them platforms to thrive and grow.
We operate in an industry where people and the 
relationships they build are paramount. Our efforts  
to find the best people range from extensive campus 
recruiting all the way to hiring senior talent laterally, 
including at the partner level. We had 85,000 applicants 
for 2,600 campus positions for 2020, illustrating our 
ability to build a workplace where tomorrow’s leaders 
want to be. We are especially focused on ensuring we 
have the best pipeline of rising talent, and the best 
programs to develop those leaders. It helps that our 
history, our people and our ideas have made Goldman 
Sachs an aspirational brand around the globe. Our brand 
has proven influential with institutions and in corporate 
boardrooms, and it resonates with new and different 
clients, such as consumers.
Closely linked with exceptional talent is the culture of 
innovation which our people foster. This firm is ready  
to capitalize on new opportunities; in fact, we are well 
underway on a number of efforts that I will describe 
below. We are deeply focused on encouraging innovation 
and new thinking across all of our businesses.
Additionally, our presence around the world today is 
truly global. We are able to serve clients everywhere that 
matters to them. As one sign of our focus on growing this 
worldwide footprint, our international net revenues have 
grown 22-fold since 1990, and represent approximately 
40 percent of our overall firmwide net revenues. Hand-
in-hand with a truly global presence is the remarkable 
depth of our client relationships. We are a trusted advisor 
known for the quality and duration of our relationships 
with corporations, governments, institutions, and 
individuals. This is because we appreciate that great 
relationships require investment and patience, in many 
cases over decades.
Lastly, I highlight our robust risk management  
culture, which is one of our most important strengths. 
We have strong processes, deep analytics, empowered 
risk and control functions, and a culture of honesty  
and communication. 
The risks we face run the gamut: some are financial in 
nature, while others are operational, technological, or

reputational. We appreciate that risk will change as our 
mix of businesses evolves. Accordingly, we are adapting 
our processes to manage risks old and new. We also 
know that we can never stop questioning, critiquing  
and improving the processes that enable our people to 
deliver excellence to clients around the world.
Our New Operating Approach
Even as we stay true to our core values, change and 
adaption are inevitable, even healthy. Today’s economic 
environment of innovation and disruption requires it. 
Over the course of the past year we have begun engaging 
in a number of cultural and operational shifts to support 
and accelerate our next major growth initiatives. And  
we are making efforts to be more open and accessible,  
both internally and externally. One example is our  
new segment reporting, which more closely aligns to  
how we are now managing our businesses, improves 
transparency, and enables stakeholders to better hold  
us accountable to the execution priorities we have set 
forth. Another example is our first Investor Day, held  
in January 2020.
A centerpiece of our operational shifts aims at simplifying 
touchpoints for our clients. We launched One Goldman 
Sachs on my first day as CEO. This initiative has already 
succeeded in delivering our capabilities more holistically 
to approximately 30 major client relationships. Our  
2020 plans include an expansion of One Goldman Sachs 
to cover approximately 100 clients, deepening these 
relationships and driving stronger returns. 
We are also shifting our operating focus to promote  
more long-term thinking and investing. Goldman Sachs 
has long prided itself on being nimble in the face of 
opportunity. This quality remains valuable, but we have 
embarked on an effort to evolve our culture more in 
favor of incentivizing investments for the future through 
a multi-year planning process. These investments in  
the future require patience and, of course, hard work  
and fortitude.
Our Financial Goals
Our strategy is intended to build a firm capable of 
generating mid-teen or higher returns over the long term, 
meaning five or more years. For the medium term, we 
unveiled a series of three-year financial targets in January 
at our Investor Day (see exhibit below). We operate in a 
cyclical industry, so our targets must be viewed in the 
context of a normalized operating environment. We are 
confident we can achieve them in such an environment.
For our medium-term targets, much of the financial 
impact comes from our focus on expense and funding 
efficiencies, which we believe are largely in our control. 
Our ability to achieve mid-teen returns or higher over a 
horizon of five years or more will come as investments in

new businesses and technologies — such as Marcus, 
Apple Card and Transaction Banking — mature. Success 
will require diligence and a long-term mindset. But our 
early results have been more than encouraging. 
Our Strategic Direction
There are three pillars to achieving our medium-term 
financial targets, each of which will be examined in 
greater depth below:
•  Growing and strengthening existing businesses, 
including expanding our footprint, to achieve  
higher wallet share 
•  Diversifying products and services and expanding  
our addressable market, for more durable earnings
•  Operating more efficiently, leading to higher margins 
and returns
Grow and Strengthen Our  
Existing Businesses
Our review of existing Goldman Sachs businesses makes 
clear that we are building on an incredible foundation. 
Our market-leading positions include the #1 Investment 
Banking franchise1, with room to expand the number of 
clients we serve and the offerings we provide; a leading 
Global Markets business that can be optimized for higher 
returns; a leading asset manager, with opportunities to 
scale our advisory-led business; and a premier ultra-high 
net worth wealth management business in the U.S. — one 
where we are accelerating growth in Europe and Asia.
Investment Banking  As the #1 investment bank, we  
are the advisor of choice to our clients. But because we are  
not #1 in every industry and geography globally, we can 
improve our relative position by capitalizing on gaps  
Goldman Sachs 2019 Annual Report

and opportunities. In particular, we are focused on 
expanding our footprint to cover more companies in the 
$500 million-$2 billion enterprise value range. This is  
a segment where, historically speaking, we only cover  
44 percent of public companies in the Americas and 
EMEA — compared to 95 percent of firms over 
$10 billion and 80 percent in the $2-10 billion range.
Global Markets  The marketplace is navigating a 
once-in-a-generation period of significant regulatory  
and technological change. We face this moment  
of disruption and opportunity with the #2 ranked 
institutional client franchise2. We are one of the few 
scaled firms in both FICC and Equities, offering  
clients differentiated risk intermediation, data analytics, 
and a rapidly evolving set of technology platforms.  
Our plan is to drive higher returns by instilling further 
resource discipline and executing on several client 
initiatives to grow our franchise.
Asset Management  Over the course of more than 
three decades, we have built a truly global, broad and 
deep asset management franchise. We have grown 
organic, fee-based active assets faster than competitors 
over the last five years, a testament to the success of  
our diversified advisory model. Our goals over the next 
five years include achieving $250 billion of firmwide 
traditional assets under supervision net inflows. 
Consumer & Wealth Management  We envision 
substantial opportunities to broaden our wealth 
management offering in the years ahead. For one, our 
advice-led ultra-high net worth wealth management 
franchise is poised for significant growth in the EMEA 
and APAC regions, boosted in part by our target of 
increasing advisors globally by roughly 30 percent  
over the next three years.

Goldman Sachs 2019 Annual Report
Diversifying Our Products and Services, 
Expanding Our Addressable Market
In general, our new business initiatives are designed to 
target more durable revenues, greater capital efficiency, 
and an enhanced funding mix. In our framework for 
evaluating opportunities, we examine whether they 
address a client need, capitalize on one or more of our 
competitive advantages, and are adjacent to one of our 
market-leading businesses. Through this lens, we have 
identified four major opportunities.
Transaction Banking  Corporates’ cash management 
and payment needs often span the globe. Even a small 
share of the massive transaction banking market would 
be accretive. Our transaction banking offering is high-
tech, low-touch, and client-focused — and as a user  
of transaction banking services ourselves, we believe  
it is unique and differentiated versus existing offerings  
in the market. Here, as we roll out offerings over the  
next several months, we see a 5-year-plus opportunity  
for $50 billion in deposit balances and $1 billion in  
net revenues.
Alternatives  In the face of a tremendous secular growth 
opportunity, we have unified our investing platforms  
and leveraged our strong, experienced investment teams 
to mount a significant expansion in our alternatives 
business. At approximately $320 billion in alternative 
assets as of December 31, 2019, we are already a top 5 
player in this space. Partnering with major asset allocators  
and institutions, we see a 5-year opportunity to achieve 
$100 billion in net alternative asset inflows. 
High Net Worth Wealth Management  We plan to 
complement our crown jewel ultra-high net worth wealth 
management franchise with a greatly expanded high  
net worth offering. Our holistic wealth solutions  
through Ayco and Goldman Sachs Personal Financial 
Management, the rebranding of the recently acquired 
United Capital, are the pillars of our expansion. We have 
less than a 1 percent share of this fragmented $18 trillion

--- Page 10 ---
market of investable assets in the U.S., and a modest 
increase in market share could drive a meaningful 
increase in revenues for our high net worth wealth 
management franchise. 
Digital Consumer Banking  We are building the digital 
consumer bank of the future. Today we are already 
addressing the spending, borrowing, and savings needs  
of millions of customers, helping them take control of 
their financial lives through an integrated platform. Our 
envisioned 5-year opportunity includes $125 billion in 
deposit balances, $20 billion in loan and card balances, 
and millions of new customers. 
Operating More Efficiently
The third pillar of our strategic direction is to  
achieve greater operational efficiency. Streamlining  
the organization for the best possible client experience  
is a key focus. We have identified ways to deploy our 
people and resources more effectively to deliver  
One Goldman Sachs, with specific initiatives aimed  
at increasing process efficiency. The expected result of  
these efforts is a targeted $1.3 billion in run-rate 
operating expense savings in three years, which will 
create capacity for investment in our growth priorities. 
We are also improving our funding profile, for example 
by diversifying our funding mix through deposits, which  
we expect to result in $1.0 billion in run-rate interest 
expense savings in three years. Additionally, consistent 
with our history of prudent capital management, we  
are looking to optimize our capital footprint, through 
efforts such as reducing our on-balance sheet equity 
investments in alternatives. 
All in, these initiatives to improve the efficiency of  
our business should supplement our growth priorities  
to drive higher margins and firmwide returns.
across our businesses. The reasons are simple: it makes 
sense for our business, and it is the right thing to do. 
Moreover, our clients expect it, and our people demand 
it. I know our shareholders feel similarly, and I am 
convinced we can do better.
While there is more for us to do as a firm, we are proud 
that in 2019 we made some important strides. We hired 
our most diverse incoming analyst class from campuses 
around the world — 49 percent women and 63 percent 
ethnically diverse. And we promoted our most diverse 
class of managing directors ever, with a record 29 percent 
women. We also announced a new practice globally to 
interview two diverse, qualified candidates for each open 
role at the level of vice president and higher, to advance 
diversity more rapidly among our mid- and senior-level 
ranks. Finally, we introduced what is now the industry’s 
leading parental and family leave policy, to help ensure 
that employees can build a family and pursue their 
professional ambitions. I am holding my partners 
accountable to deliver progress in those areas of the  
firm where they have oversight.
At the same time that we are focusing on improving  
the state of our own firm’s diversity and reinforcing an 
inclusive environment, we are also thinking critically 
about our role as a steward of the global capital markets, 
and how we can make meaningful progress on this issue 
through our client interactions.
I recently announced one way for us to do just that. 
Starting this summer, we will only underwrite initial 
public offerings for companies domiciled in Western 
Europe and the U.S. that have at least one diverse board 
member. And come 2021, the figure will rise to two.
We did this, first and foremost, because we believe this  
is the best possible advice we could provide our clients 
looking to go public. In addition, the benefits will be 
long-lasting, and accrue to all of us. 
Diversity and Inclusion as  
Strategic Imperatives
Advancing diversity and inclusion is a personal priority 
of mine, particularly when it comes to leadership roles 
Sustainability
The private sector has traditionally seen sustainability  
as a peripheral issue, narrowly tailored to a company’s 
environmental impact. That kind of thinking no longer

in financing, investing and advisory activity 
to nine areas that focus on climate transition 
and inclusive economic growth by 2030
holds. Today, the concept of sustainability has broadened 
to include not only how a company manages its 
operations but also how it conducts its core business. 
Sustainability is increasingly top of mind for our clients 
and front and center for the next generation of talent. 
That is why for Goldman Sachs, executing a best-in-class 
sustainability strategy is central to our long-term success.
We see a clear commercial rationale to this work, where 
we are able to leverage our leading businesses and global 
relationships to deliver results for shareholders and 
progress for society as a whole. To that end, we have 
announced a 10-year target of $750 billion in financing, 
investing and advisory activity to nine areas that focus  
on climate transition and inclusive economic growth.  
We have created a new team, the Sustainable Finance 
Group, to partner with our businesses in executing on 
this ambitious mandate, delivering sustainable solutions 
consistent with our clients’ long-term objectives. 
Philanthropic capital also remains critical. We are 
focused on ensuring our efforts in this area are aligned 
with and accretive to our overall sustainability objectives. 
Our signature entrepreneurship programs 10,000 Women 
and 10,000 Small Businesses provide access to capital, 
mentorship and community for business owners  
around the world. Milestones in 2019 included 10,000 
Women’s 10th anniversary of operating in China and  
the expansion of 10,000 Small Businesses into Iowa,  
New Hampshire, and Ohio. Graduates of these programs  
take the knowledge they acquire and apply it to their 
businesses — creating jobs and driving growth in the 
communities where they live and work.
The year 2019 was a time to define our strategic plan  
and financial goals. At the turn of the calendar year,  
we had a clear-eyed view of our plan and shared it  
with stakeholders on Investor Day. Its essential elements 
are now in motion. 
The Goldman Sachs of 2020 and beyond will still 
resemble the firm I joined in 1999 in terms of its core 
values, cultural attributes and its key businesses. The 
ethos of this firm is to put capital and ideas to work to 
expand the potential of organizations, accelerate global 
economies, and amplify personal prosperity. We are 
passionate about our role in the world. None of this  
has changed.
But our approach to the world and our mix of businesses 
are both progressing. In my 21 years with the firm, we 
have already seen a significant evolution. This is healthy 
and even vital to our success. 
As we look to the future, we are committed to executing 
upon our long-term strategy, strengthening the market-
leading positions of our core franchises, and investing for 
growth in new businesses and opportunities. As the 
current COVID-19 pandemic reminds us, however, the 
operating environment can shift overnight. This means 
that, regardless of market conditions, our focus must 
always remain on what has sustained Goldman Sachs 
over the last 150 years: our people, our culture, and 
above all, the evolving needs of our clients. In doing so, 
we are well-positioned to compete in the years ahead, 
and to deliver higher, more sustainable returns for our 
shareholders.

Our Core Values and Business Principles
Our Core Values
We distilled our Business Principles into 4 core values that inform everything we do:
Partnership              Client Service              Integrity              Excellence
Goldman Sachs Business Principles
Our clients’ interests  
always come first. 
Our experience shows that if we  
serve our clients well, our own  
success will follow.
Our assets are our people,  
capital and reputation. 
If any of these is ever diminished, the 
last is the most difficult to restore. We 
are dedicated to complying fully with 
the letter and spirit of the laws, rules 
and ethical principles that govern us. 
Our continued success depends upon 
unswerving adherence to this standard.
Our goal is to provide superior 
returns to our shareholders. 
Profitability is critical to achieving 
superior returns, building our capital, 
and attracting and keeping our best 
people. Significant employee stock 
ownership aligns the interests of our 
employees and our shareholders.
We take great pride in the 
professional quality of our work. 
We have an uncompromising 
determination to achieve excellence  
in everything we undertake. Though  
we may be involved in a wide variety 
and heavy volume of activity, we  
would, if it came to a choice, rather  
be best than biggest.
We stress creativity and  
imagination in everything we do. 
While recognizing that the old way may 
still be the best way, we constantly 
strive to find a better solution to a 
client’s problems. We pride ourselves 
on having pioneered many of the 
practices and techniques that have 
become standard in the industry.
We make an unusual effort to  
identify and recruit the very best 
person for every job. 
Although our activities are measured in 
billions of dollars, we select our people 
one by one. In a service business,  
we know that without the best people, 
we cannot be the best firm.
We offer our people the opportunity 
to move ahead more rapidly than is 
possible at most other places. 
Advancement depends on merit and 
we have yet to find the limits to the 
responsibility our best people are able 
to assume. For us to be successful, our 
people must reflect the diversity of  
the communities and cultures in which 
we operate. That means we must 
attract, retain and motivate people from 
many backgrounds and perspectives. 
Being diverse is not optional; it is what 
we must be.
We stress teamwork  
in everything we do. 
While individual creativity is always 
encouraged, we have found that team 
effort often produces the best results. 
We have no room for those who put their 
personal interests ahead of the interests 
of the firm and its clients.
The dedication of our people to  
the firm and the intense effort  
they give their jobs are greater  
than one finds in most other 
organizations. 
We think that this is an important  
part of our success.
We consider our size an asset  
that we try hard to preserve. 
We want to be big enough to undertake 
the largest project that any of our clients 
could contemplate, yet small enough to 
maintain the loyalty, the intimacy and 
the esprit de corps that we all treasure 
and that contribute greatly to our 
success.
We constantly strive to anticipate 
the rapidly changing needs of our 
clients and to develop new services 
to meet those needs. 
We know that the world of finance will 
not stand still and that complacency  
can lead to extinction.
We regularly receive confidential 
information as part of our normal 
client relationships. 
To breach a confidence or to use 
confidential information improperly or 
carelessly would be unthinkable.
Our business is highly competitive, 
and we aggressively seek to expand 
our client relationships. 
However, we must always be fair 
competitors and must never denigrate 
other firms.
Integrity and honesty are  
at the heart of our business. 
We expect our people to maintain high 
ethical standards in everything they do, 
both in their work for the firm and in 
their personal lives.

Dear fellow shareholders,
For more than 150 years, Nestlé has consistently delivered sustainable, 
industry‑leading results by offering healthy, delicious, convenient food and 
beverage products and services. In a rapidly‑changing environment, the  
key to our success has been our ability to balance continuity with change.  
It has required discipline and decisive actions to build sustainable value for the 
long term. We continue on our Nutrition, Health and Wellness journey, while 
we stay true to our purpose and values. We change by adapting our portfolio 
to meet evolving consumer demands, pushing the boundaries of science, 
accelerating innovation, as well as driving greater agility and efficiencies. Our 
people are embracing these changes with passion and dedication. This gives  
us confidence that Nestlé is well positioned for the future.
On track to meet our 2020 goals
Our value creation model is based on a balance 
of top-line growth and bottom-line performance, 
as well as improved capital efficiency. We plan to 
reach mid single-digit organic growth by 2020. 
We also aim to increase our underlying trading 
operating profit margin to between 17.5% and 
18.5% (from 16.0% in 2016). Our 2018 results 
demonstrate that we are on track to meet  
these targets:
 – Organic growth was 3.0%, with continued 
strong real internal growth (RIG) of 2.5% and 
pricing of 0.5%. Growth was supported by 
stronger momentum in the United States  
and China, as well as in infant nutrition.
 – Total reported sales increased by 2.1%  
to CHF 91.4 billion (2017: CHF 89.6 billion).  
Net acquisitions had a positive impact  
of 0.7% and foreign exchange reduced  
sales by 1.6%.
 – Underlying trading operating profit (UTOP) 
margin reached 17.0%, up of 50 basis points. 
Trading operating profit (TOP) margin increased 
by 30 basis points to 15.1%, reflecting higher 
restructuring- related expenses.
Based on these results, the Board of Directors 
has proposed a 24th consecutive increase of the 
yearly dividend to CHF 2.45, to be paid in 2019.
Sharpening our strategic focus
During 2018, our Board reaffirmed the Nutrition, 
Health and Wellness strategy and took decisive 
2
steps to sharpen our strategic focus on food, 
beverages and nutritional health products. 
Consistent with this, we continued to invest in 
advancing the high-growth categories of coffee, 
petcare, nutrition, water, as well as Nestlé Health 
Science. We manage the other categories for a 
balance of growth and value. Due to changing 
industry dynamics and following detailed 
analysis, the Board determined that future 
growth opportunities for Nestlé Skin Health lie 
increasingly outside the Group’s strategic scope. 
It therefore decided to explore strategic options 
for Nestlé Skin Health in the best long-term 
interest of this business and Nestlé shareholders. 
The review is expected to be completed by  
mid-2019.
We further accelerated our portfolio 
management through targeted acquisitions 
that come with high growth potential, deliver 
attractive returns and build on our leadership 
positions. We acquired the perpetual global 
license of Starbucks consumer packaged goods 
and foodservice products. With Starbucks, 
Nescafé and Nespresso we have brought together 
the world’s most iconic coffee brands. We 
acquired Atrium Innovations, a global leader in 
natural, non-GMO vitamins and supplements. In 
addition, we completed the divestiture of our U.S. 
confectionery business, where our low market 
share constrained our ability to win in that market. 
We also completed the sale of the Gerber Life 
Insurance, which was non-core to our business.

Letter to our shareholders
Accelerating growth through innovation  
in a fast-changing environment
In 2018, we delivered improved revenue growth 
and profitability. We achieved this in the 
context of a volatile economic environment and 
significant disruption in both our industry and the 
retail sector.
Consumer tastes, preferences and 
expectations are changing at an unprecedented 
rate. Trends towards more natural and organic 
foods, plant-based proteins, as well as simpler 
and healthier ingredients, are redefining the 
pace at which we need to innovate. Our growth 
was supported by disciplined execution and 
short innovation cycles. In order to launch new 
products quickly, we use rapid prototyping  
and leverage our industry-leading R&D network  
for quick in-market testing. Examples of  
fast product innovation include KitKat Ruby,  
the Yes! snack bar, Perrier & Juice, and  
Garden Gourmet, an authentic vegan meat 
analogue offering.
Moreover, the rise of digital and online 
shopping is fundamentally changing the retail 
industry. We are embracing the opportunities 
offered by the digital transformation across 
marketing, social media and e-commerce. In 
doing so, we are delivering more personalized 
products, messages and services directly to 
our consumers. In 2018, our e-commerce sales 
grew organically by +18% (+25% excluding 
Nespresso) and reached 7.4% of total Nestlé 
sales. There were also strong contributions 
from other fast-growing channels, such as 
Direct-to-Consumer, Convenience, Club,  
Value, Natural, Specialty stores, as well as 
Out-of-Home. We are constantly adapting  
our business models to wherever people look  
for our brands and products.
Our consumers do not just care about what 
they eat, but they also care about how products 
are made and their impact on the environment 
and society. We have placed packaging and 
plastics at the top of our agenda by announcing 
our goal to make 100% of our packaging 
recyclable or reusable by 2025. We are also 
pursuing collective action at an industry level  
in collaboration with our retail partners  
and governments.
4
As we look to 2019, we see that input costs  
are rising, particularly in energy, distribution and  
packaging. As parts of the world are beginning  
to see reinflation, notably emerging markets  
and the United States, the strength of our brands  
and our ability to differentiate and innovate will  
continue to be key to our success.
Improving operational efficiency
To fuel our growth and improve returns, we  
have intensified our drive to find operational  
efficiencies and reduce structural costs. This  
reflects our belief that consumers should not  
pay for our inefficiencies. We have made good  
progress on our significant cost-reduction  
programs across the areas of administration,  
procurement and manufacturing.
We continued to strengthen our business  
focus through simplified and standardized  
processes. We increased the penetration of our  
shared service centers from 17% to 35%, and are 
on track to reach 50% by 2020. In procurement,  
we realized significant savings by leveraging our 
size and scale through three global purchasing  
hubs. We now source 55% of our requirements  
through these hubs and this will reach 60%  
by 2020. In manufacturing we have further  
simplified our factory footprint and increased  
capacity utilization.
The savings that we have generated so far  
have made a significant contribution to the  
improvement in our underlying trading operating  
profit margin. In 2018, it increased by 50 basis  
points to 17.0%.
We also continued to deliver efficiencies in the  
area of R&D and marketing. The primary focus  
of these efficiencies is to free up resources to  
reinvest in growth opportunities and innovation.
We continue to simplify our organizational  
structure to speed up decision-making and  
responsiveness to new consumer trends. In  
2018, infant nutrition successfully moved from a  
globally-managed to a regionally-managed business 
reported within the three Zones. Zone EMENA also 
continued its transformation to a category-focused 
organization, while maintaining the connection to  
local consumers through our Nestlé Markets. In  
parallel, we have tailored compensation to increase 
focus on pricing and capital efficiency.

Increasing cash returns to shareholders
In 2018, we returned CHF 13.9 billion to 
shareholders through dividends and share 
repurchases. Share buybacks amounted to 
CHF 6.8 billion, as part of the three-year buyback 
program started in July 2017. Over the last ten 
years, Nestlé has returned CHF 104 billion to 
shareholders, of which CHF 40 billion has been in 
the form of share repurchases.
Board of Directors engagement
Our Board of Directors is fully engaged and  
takes an active role in providing guidance on  
our long-term Nutrition, Health and Wellness 
strategy and Creating Shared Value. We benefit 
from the perspectives of seven new independent 
directors who have been added since 2015. This 
includes three directors added in 2018, who  
bring highly-relevant expertise and experience  
as leaders of consumer-facing companies.
In 2018, the Board conducted a strategic 
review that included an analysis of recent trends 
in the food and beverages industry, as well as our 
responses to them. During the year, the Board 
also carried out an analysis of the company’s 
financial structure. It evaluated the M&A 
approach and track record. It also decided to 
explore strategic options for Nestlé Skin Health. 
In addition, the Board also continuously monitors 
the returns and strategic options of our financial 
investment in L’Oréal.
The Board reviewed the progress of Nestlé 
Business Excellence. It assessed the company’s 
talent pool, supporting actions to improve 
gender balance and increase cultural diversity. It 
examined how the company’s talent acquisition, 
retention and development strategies are being 
adapted to cope with the demands of a changing 
work force.
The Board also visited Nestlé in the United 
States on its annual visit to a major market.
During 2018, the Board continued its ongoing 
review of the company’s governance policies and 
compensation to ensure best practices. The Audit 
Committee and the Chairman’s and Corporate 
Governance Committee provided thorough risk 
oversight. The Sustainability Committee reviewed 
our environmental, social and governance 
commitments to support our goal of enhancing 
quality of life and contributing to a healthier future 
for individuals and families, our communities and 
the planet.
Value for all stakeholders
We believe that our Creating Shared Value 
approach enables us to optimize value for our 
shareholders and have a long-term positive 
impact on all stakeholders connected to our 
business. This includes: employees, consumers, 
business partners, as well as the communities 
in which we operate. We recognize that we 
need to continually earn the trust of all of our 
stakeholders. This must be done through the 
way we manage our businesses, create products 
and pursue profitable growth. We emphasize a 
balanced approach by taking an inclusive view of 
these stakeholders, placing Nutrition, Health and 
Wellness at the core of our strategy.
We take this opportunity to thank all our 
associates for their dedication, initiative and 
energy in driving our results. We also express our 
gratitude to the communities in which we live and 
work. Finally, we thank you, our shareholders,  
for your continued support, trust and confidence.

--- Page 11 ---
As the ‘Good Food, Good Life’ 
company, we enhance quality of 
life and contribute to a healthier 
future. Winning with consumers 
is the source of our sustainable 
financial performance and our 
way to earning trust and maintain 
our market leadership. Based on a 
compelling Nutrition, Health and 
Wellness strategy, our company 
delivers sustainable value over the 
short term and the long term.
Nestlé has many distinctive strengths that keep 
us at the top of our industry. Our people are our 
greatest strength. We have an attractive product 
portfolio in growing categories with leading 
market positions. We are a global company with 
deep local roots, which gives us a unique ability 
to understand local consumers and adapt fast to 
their preferences. We have powerful, valuable 
brands, which consumers trust. Our products 
reach more than 1 billion consumers every day 
across the world. We also have industry-leading 
R&D capabilities that support our Nutrition, 
Health and Wellness strategy and our  
innovation initiatives.
Our Nutrition, Health and Wellness strategy
Our success is built on our Nutrition, Health and 
Wellness strategy. Food and beverages are core 
to Nestlé. We aim to provide the tastiest and 
healthiest choices, for all times of the day and for 
all stages of life, delivered in a convenient manner. 
We aim to capture premiumization opportunities 
and, at the other end of the spectrum, offer 
affordable, high-quality nutrition. We add value 
to our brands and products through meaningful 
differentiation and innovation. We do this by 
continually improving the taste, convenience 
and nutritional qualities of our products. We are 
also well-positioned to build and share nutrition 
knowledge from the first 1000 days of life through 
to healthy aging, and benefit from increased 
interest in nutrition to support good health.
How do we create long-term value?
Our long-term value creation model is based on 
the balanced pursuit of resource efficient top- and 
bottom-line growth. We create value by:
 – Increasing growth through innovation, 
differentiation and by being relevant to our 
consumers. We have committed to reach mid 
single-digit organic growth by 2020.
 – Improving operational efficiency with 
the goal to increase our underlying trading 
operating profit margin to between 17.5% and 
18.5% (from 16.0% in 2016), and
 – Allocating our resources and capital with 
discipline and clear priorities, including 
through acquisitions and divestitures.
Increasing growth
Our portfolio is well positioned for growth. In 
the past, we have consistently delivered organic 
growth at the high end of the industry. We have 
a clear path to achieving mid single-digit organic 
growth by 2020.
Investing in high-growth categories and 
regions. We have identified five high-growth 
food and beverages categories with attractive 
growth rates: coffee, petcare, nutrition, water 
and Nestlé Health Science. Together, they 
represent 57% of sales and 61% of underlying 
trading operating profit *. In 2018, organic growth 
was +4.0%. In these key categories, we have 
strong market positions and highly-differentiated 
offerings. They receive particular emphasis 
from a capital allocation standpoint, with 
significant investments in R&D, marketing, capital 
expenditure and external growth whenever 
appropriate. The other categories continue to 
be important contributors and had 1.9% organic 
growth in 2018. These businesses are managed 
for a combination of growth and value.
We are also focused on expanding our 
presence in high-growth regions. Emerging 
markets represent 42% of sales. In 2018, they 
* Before unallocated items.

Pursuing our value-creating strategy
grew organically by +4.9%, three times faster 
than developed markets and with a higher 
underlying trading operating profit margin. In 
most of these emerging markets, Nestlé has been 
present for many decades and our brands enjoy a 
high level of trust and are rightly viewed as local.
Fixing underperforming businesses. 
We have taken decisive actions to improve 
underperforming businesses through innovation, 
better consumer understanding and, when 
needed, management changes and restructuring. 
In 2018, turnaround examples included Nestlé 
Skin Health and Yinlu in China.
Innovating products and business models. 
Rapid innovation and bringing products to market 
faster are key dimensions of our growth agenda. 
At the same time, we continue to invest in 
cutting-edge science and technology to address 
evolving consumer expectations through new 
offerings and product reformulations. Innovation 
also helps us to premiumize our offering and 
contributes to margin improvement. In 2018, 
22% of our sales came from premium products. 
We are not just innovating with new products 
but also new business models. In particular, 
we have a strong focus on personalized and 
Direct-to-Consumer offerings. In 2018, 8.2%  
of our sales came from Direct-to-Consumer  
business models.
Embracing digital opportunities. Our digital 
transformation focuses on delivering personalized 
messaging, services and products to consumers 
at scale. Powered by data and technology, we are 
modernizing our existing brands and business 
operations while developing new, digitally-centric 
business models. Already 10% of all consumer 
contacts are personalized. In addition, in 2018, 
our e-commerce sales grew five times faster  
than the Group average and reached 7.4% of total 
Nestlé sales.
Managing our portfolio. We continue 
to actively evolve our portfolio towards 
attractive, high-growth businesses. In 2018, 
we strengthened our position in coffee 
through the acquisition of the perpetual global 
license of Starbucks consumer packaged 
goods and foodservice products. We also 
divested our U.S confectionery and Gerber 
Life Insurance businesses. While much work 
8
has been done, we are not yet finished. We 
recognize that acquisitions can provide access 
to new technologies, brands, categories and 
geographies. Similarly, small to medium-sized 
acquisitions can offer a fast and cost-effective 
way to embrace new capabilities or business 
models. We are also actively divesting businesses 
that are non-core and where we have limited 
ability to win. We do this in a disciplined way 
with an aim to minimize potential disruption and 
maximize the value of existing businesses.
Improving operational efficiency
In addition to our growth agenda, we have 
committed to increase our underlying trading 
operating profit margin from 16.0% in 2016 to 
between 17.5% and 18.5% by 2020.
Reducing costs. We are actively executing 
several cost-saving initiatives to reduce 
non-consumer facing structural costs by 
between CHF 2.0 and 2.5 billion. These are 
primarily focused on the areas of administration, 
procurement and manufacturing.
We continued to strengthen our business 
focus through our Nestlé Business Excellence 
program to simplify and standardize processes, 
which helped reduce administrative costs. We 
have increased the penetration of our shared 
service centers from 17% to 35% and are on track 
to reach 50% by 2020. We have also generated 
efficiencies in facility management, and real 
estate through site closure and consolidations.
In procurement we have realized significant 
savings by leveraging our size and scale through 
three global purchasing hubs. We now source 
55% of our requirements through these hubs, and 
this will reach 60% by 2020.
In manufacturing we have further simplified our 
factory footprint and increased capacity utilization.
The savings generated in these three areas so 
far have made a significant contribution to the 
improvement in our underlying trading operating 
profit margin by 50 basis points to 17.0% in 2018, 
and there is more to come.
Freeing up resources. We have also continued 
to deliver efficiencies in R&D and marketing. 
The primary focus of these programs is to free 
up resources to provide fuel for growth and 
innovation. As an example, in the last three years,

A balanced value creation model
At Nestlé, we believe the best way to guarantee 
long-term sustainable value creation is through a 
balanced pursuit of growth, profitability and capital 
efficiency. Growth is the primary driver of value 
creation. At the same time, we pursue efficiency and 
profitable growth because we recognize that our 
competitiveness is what ensures our sustainability.  
We are disciplined in our capital allocation and 
committed to increasing shareholder returns, while 
investing for the long-term and Creating Shared Value.
more than CHF 500 million in marketing savings 
have been reinvested in building our brands.
Adjusting management structures and 
systems. We have continued to adapt our 
organization to be simpler and faster. We 
are empowering our market and regional 
teams to drive growth. To support them, we 
have implemented initiatives to delayer our 
organization and speed up decision making 
at a local level. In parallel, we have tailored 
compensation to prioritize profitable growth and 
improved capital efficiency.
Allocating capital with discipline and  
clear priorities
We follow prudent financial policies designed to 
strike the right balance between capital allocation 
and flexible access to financial markets. We have 
well-defined priorities in this regard.
Investing in organic growth. We invest in 
our business through R&D, brand support and 
capital expenditure to support top-line growth. 
Our approach is rigorous and discerning. We 
are allocating more resources behind those 
businesses with the highest potential to create 
economic profit. We have also continued to focus 
on reducing working capital. The five-quarter 
average working capital in % of sales reached 
1.4% at the end of 2018, –20 bps versus the  
restated figure for 2017.
Paying dividends. For 2019, the Board of 
Directors has proposed a 24th consecutive 
dividend increase amounting to CHF 2.45. This 
underlines our commitment to continually return 
capital to shareholders.
Disciplined approach to acquisitions. This 
is based on strategic and cultural fit, as well 
as financial returns. We pursue a disciplined 
acquisition policy, particularly in terms of the 
price that we are prepared to pay. We prioritize 
our high-growth categories and regions, 
particularly coffee, nutrition, petcare, water and 
Nestlé Health Science. For the companies we 
acquire, we have solid integration plans with clear 
accountability and precise targets.
Share buybacks. We have returned 
CHF 6.8 billion of capital to shareholders in 2018 
through share repurchases. This is part of the 
three-year CHF 20 billion share buyback program 
announced in July 2017. This brings the total 
returned to shareholders over the last ten years to 
104 billion.
We also regularly review our capital structure 
to ensure it is appropriate in the context of market 
conditions and our strategic priorities.
Creating Shared Value
Creating Shared Value (CSV) is fundamental 
to how we do business. We believe that our 
company will only be successful for the long term 
by creating value for both our shareholders and 
for society.
Business benefits and positive societal impact 
are mutually reinforcing. In practical terms,  
our products must provide a nutritional benefit  
to the consumer. They must also contribute to  
the development of the local communities  
where we operate and protect the environment 
for future generations through the practice of 
resource stewardship.

Oligosaccharide (HMOs) blend 
which promotes a healthy baby 
gut bacteria and reduces the risk 
of infections by stimulating  
the immune system.

--- Page 15 ---
At Nestlé, continuous innovation is 
part of our DNA. It is a cornerstone 
of our success and key to our 
strategy. For over 150 years, we 
have built unique competitive 
advantages. We have unmatched 
expertise in understanding the 
relationship between nutrition and 
health. Our ability to identify local 
and global trends and translate 
these into meaningful innovations 
that meet consumer demand is 
what drives our growth.
Science-based innovation
Nestlé operates the world’s largest science and 
innovation network in the food and beverages 
industry. In 2018, we invested CHF 1.7 billion into 
R&D. This investment enables us to strengthen 
our solid scientific foundation, leading to new 
breakthrough science and technologies.
We continue to invest in long-term 
innovation projects with the potential for high 
returns. Examples include infant and maternal 
nutrition, healthy aging, personalized nutrition, 
and understanding the microbiome. We are 
committed to delivering on our Nutrition, Health 
and Wellness strategy by further reducing 
sugar, salt and fat. We are also eliminating food 
additives, while fortifying existing products with 
added nutritional benefits.
At the same time, we have increased the 
pace of innovation to be even more responsive 
to consumer trends. We are encouraging our 
researchers to think like entrepreneurs, to explore 
and rapidly test new ideas. In order to stay on  
top of emerging science and technology trends,  
we collaborate closely with academic institutions, 
start-ups and innovation partners across  
the world.
Rapidly-evolving consumer preferences
The food and beverages industry is transforming 
rapidly. Smaller, agile and fast-moving start-ups 
are challenging larger companies by increasing 
the rate of change. Consumer needs and 
expectations are also evolving. There is  
greater demand for healthier and more  
authentic products, including those that are 
locally inspired. These reflect a desire for greater 
transparency and new product experiences. 
There is also a growing global trend toward 
healthier lifestyles, including specific dietary 
requirements such as vegetarian, lactose-free  
or gluten-free.
Increasing our speed
Having great ideas is important, but the real 
opportunity lies in how fast we translate these 
into attractive and relevant products. We want 
to win in the marketplace by creating more 
new and impactful products, services and 
experiences. To launch new products quickly we 
use fast prototyping and leverage our size and 
scale for quick in-market testing. Our R&D and 
commercial functions join forces from the start 
to determine what is desirable to the consumer, 
feasible for the business and creates value 
for Nestlé. We combine this with a pragmatic 
approach to market entry. We are leveraging 
our existing industrial footprint, R&D facilities 
and co-manufacturing partners to support 
faster launches. This allows us to lower or defer 
capital expenditure commitments until we 
have evidence from the market place that an 
innovation can gain traction.
Addressing local consumer trends
When it comes to understanding consumers 
we remain at the forefront of our industry. 
We are a largely decentralized organization, 
which means that our teams are close to the 
consumer. We want to take greater advantage 
of this strength. To do so, we are simplifying 
our innovation processes, and empowering 
our local teams to move earlier on trends. We 
encourage these teams to take greater initiative 
and create products relevant to local consumers. 
Our ambition is to create a steady stream of 
innovative stand-out products.

Dear Fellow Shareholders,
Jamie Dimon,
Chairman and  
Chief Executive Officer
I begin this letter with a sense of gratitude and pride about JPMorgan Chase that 
has only grown stronger over the course of the last decade. Ours is an exceptional 
company with an extraordinary heritage and a promising future. 
Throughout a period of profound political and economic change around the world, 
our company has been steadfast in our dedication to the clients, communities and 
countries we serve while earning a fair return for our shareholders. 
2016 was another breakthrough year for our company. We earned a record $24.7 billion 
in net income on revenue 1 of $99.1 billion, reﬂecting strong underlying performance 
across our businesses. We have delivered record results in six out of the last seven 
years, and we hope to continue to deliver in the future. 
Our stock price is a measure of the progress we have made over the years. This 
progress is a function of continually making important investments, in good times and 
not so good times, to build our capabilities — people, systems and products. These

the extraordinarily difficult legal, regulatory and political environments that followed. 
We have long contended that these factors explained why bank stock price/earnings 
ratios were appropriately depressed. And we believe the anticipated reversal of many 
negatives and the expectation of a more business-friendly environment, coupled with 
our sustained, strong business results, are among the reasons our stock price has done 
so well this past year. 
As you know, we believe tangible book value per share is a good measure of the value 
we have created for our shareholders. If we believe our asset and liability values are 
appropriate — and we do — and if we believe we can continue to deploy this capital at 
an approximate 15% return on tangible equity, which we do, then our company should 
ultimately be worth considerably more than tangible book value. If you look at the 
chart below, you’ll see that tangible book value “anchors” the stock price.
In the last ﬁve years, we have bought back $25.7 billion in stock. In prior years, I have 
explained why buying back our stock at tangible book value per share was a no-
brainer. While the ﬁrst and most important use of capital is to invest in growth, buying 
back stock should also be considered when you are generating excess capital. We do

Tangible book value over time captures the company’s use of capital, balance sheet and profitability. In this chart, we are looking at 
heritage Bank One shareholders and JPMorgan Chase & Co. shareholders. The chart shows the increase in tangible book value per share;  
it is an after-tax number assuming all dividends were retained vs. the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (S&P 500), which is a pre-tax number 
with dividends reinvested.
1 On March 27, 2000, Jamie Dimon was hired as CEO of Bank One.
currently have excess capital. Five years ago, we offered the example of our buying 
back stock at tangible book value and having earnings per share and tangible book 
value per share substantially higher than they otherwise would have been just four 
years later. While we prefer buying our stock at tangible book value, we think it makes 
sense to do so at or around two times tangible book value for reasons similar to those 
we’ve expressed in the past. If we buy back a big block of stock this year (using analyst 
earnings estimates for the next ﬁve years), we would expect earnings per share in ﬁve 
years to be 3%—4% higher, and tangible book value would be virtually unchanged. 
In this letter, I discuss the issues highlighted on the next page — which describe many 
of our successes and opportunities, as well as our challenges and responses. Like last 
year’s letter, we have organized much of the content around some of the key questions 
we have received from shareholders and other interested parties.

I.  
The JPMorgan Chase franchise
1. Why do we consider our four major business franchises strong and market leading? 
2.  Why are we optimistic about our future growth opportunities?
3.  What are some technology and ﬁntech initiatives that you’re most excited about? 
4.  How do we protect customers and their sensitive information while enabling them 
to share data? 
5.  What are your biggest geopolitical risks?
6.  Although banks and other large companies remain unpopular with some people, 
you often say how proud you are of JPMorgan Chase. Why?  
II.   Regulatory reform
1. 
Talk about the strength and safety of the ﬁnancial system and whether Too Big  
to Fail has been solved. 
2.  How and why should capital rules be changed?
3.  How do certain regulatory policies impact money markets?
4.  How has regulation affected monetary policy, the ﬂow of bank credit and the 
 growth of the economy? 
5.  How can we reform mortgage markets to give qualiﬁed borrowers access to the 
credit they need? 
6.  How can we reduce complexity and create a more coherent regulatory system?
7.  How can we harmonize regulations across the globe?
III.   Public policy
1. 
The United States of America is truly an exceptional country.
2.  But it is clear that something is wrong — and it’s holding us back.
3.  How can we start investing in our people to help them be more productive and 
share in the opportunities and rewards of our economy?
4.  What should our country be doing to invest in its infrastructure? How does the lack 
of a plan and investment hurt our economy?
5.  How should the U.S. legal and regulatory systems be reformed to incentivize 
investment and job creation?
6.  What price are we paying for the lack of understanding about business and  
free enterprise?
7. 
Strong collaboration is needed between business and government.

I. THE  JPM OR GAN  CH ASE FR ANCHI SE
1. Why do we consider our four major business franchises strong and market leading?
The chart below and those on page 8 speak 
for themselves. Looking closely at the actual 
numbers, it’s clear that every business is 
among the top performers ﬁnancially – 
whether you look at eﬃciency (overhead 
ratios) or return on equity (ROE) vs. the best 
in that business. More important, customer 
satisfaction is at the center of everything 
we do. Each business has gained market 
share – which is possible only when you are 
improving customer satisfaction and your 
products and services relative to the competi-
tion. And each business continues to inno-
vate, from customer-facing apps, to straight-
through processing, to digitized trading 
services or payment systems. Our business 
leaders do a great job describing their busi-
nesses, and I strongly encourage you to read 
their letters following this year’s Letter to 
Shareholders. Each will give you a feel for 
why we are optimistic about our future.

2.  Why are we optimistic about our future growth opportunities?
We believe we have substantial opportuni-
ties in the decades ahead to drive organic 
growth in our company. We have conﬁdence 
in the underlying growth in the U.S. and 
global economies, which will fuel the growth 
in our customer base – consumer deposits, 
assets under management and small to large 
clients globally. This growth will obviously 
be faster in emerging markets than in devel-
oped markets – and we are well-positioned 
to serve both. In addition, we believe we 
can continue to gain share in many markets 
and, over time, add new, relevant products. 
This can drive organic growth for years. 
Capturing this growth is very basic:
(cid:228)(cid:3) Selectively adding investment bankers 
and private bankers around the world
(cid:228)(cid:3) Bringing consumer and commercial 
banking branches and capabilities to more 
places in the United States
(cid:228)(cid:3) Adding wholesale branches overseas and 
carefully expanding into new countries
(cid:228)(cid:3) Adding wholesale and Private Bank clients 
as they grow into our target space
Equally important is using technology and 
ﬁntech to do a better job serving clients and 
to grow our businesses – with better products 
and services. You can read more about our 
big data, machine learning, payment systems, 
cybersecurity and electronic trading on pages 
47–68 described by our senior executives. But 
I do want to highlight a few items in the next 
question that pertain to these topics.
3.  What are some technology and ﬁntech initiatives that you’re most excited about?
One of the reasons we’re performing well as 
a company is we never stopped investing in 
technology – this should never change. In 
2016, we spent more than $9.5 billion in  
technology ﬁrmwide, of which approxi-
mately $3 billion is dedicated toward new 
initiatives. Of that amount, approximately 
$600 million is spent on emerging ﬁntech 
solutions – which include building and 
improving digital and mobile services and 
partnering with ﬁntech companies. The 
reasons we invest so much in technology 
(whether it’s digital, big data or machine 
learning) are simple: to beneﬁt customers 
with better, faster and often cheaper prod-
ucts and services, to reduce errors and to 
make the ﬁrm more eﬃcient.
We are developing great new products. 
We are currently developing some exciting 
new products and services, which we will be 
adding to our suite and rolling out later this 
year, including: 
(cid:228)(cid:3) End-to-end digital banking – The ability to 
open an account and complete the majority 
of transactions on a mobile phone.
(cid:228)(cid:3) Investment advice and self-directed 
investing – Online vehicles for both indi-
vidual retirement and non-retirement 
accounts, providing easy-to-use (and 
inexpensive) automated advice, as well as 
enabling our customers to buy and sell 
stocks and bonds, etc. (again inexpensively).
(cid:228)(cid:3) Electronic trading and other online services 
(e.g., cash management) in our Corporate 
& Investment Bank and Asset & Wealth 
Management businesses – Oﬀering our 
clients a more robust digital platform.

I.  THE JPMORGAN CHA SE FRA NCHIS E 
We are investing in data and technology to 
improve the ﬁnancial health of low-income 
households.
Over the last two years, the JPMorgan Chase 
Institute has helped identify some of the 
most pressing ﬁnancial challenges facing 
American households, such as their diﬃculty 
managing income and expense volatility. 
We are using that data to select and support 
innovative ﬁntech companies and nonproﬁts 
that are designing solutions to address these 
challenges. One example of these eﬀorts 
is JPMorgan Chase’s Financial Solutions 
Lab, which, in partnership with the Center 
for Financial Services Innovation, seeks to 
facilitate the next generation of ﬁntech prod-
ucts to help consumers manage their daily 
ﬁnances and meet their long-term goals. 
Highlights of the initiative include: 
(cid:228)(cid:3) To date, the Lab has helped support more 
than 18 ﬁntech companies working to 
improve the ﬁnancial health of more than 
1 million Americans. One example is Digit, 
an automated savings tool that identi-
ﬁes small amounts of money that can be 
moved into savings based on spending 
and income. To date, it has helped Ameri-
cans save more than $350 million.
(cid:228)(cid:3) Lab winners have raised more than $100 
million in follow-on capital.
(cid:228)(cid:3) In 2017, we launched a new competition 
seeking innovative ﬁntech solutions to 
promote the ﬁnancial health of popula-
tions often overlooked, such as people of 
color, individuals with disabilities and low-
income women. 
We are successfully collaborating with other 
companies to deliver ﬁntech solutions.
Whether it is consumer payment systems 
(Zelle), mortgages (Roostify), auto ﬁnance 
(TrueCar), small business lending (OnDeck 
Capital) or communications systems 
(Symphony), we are successfully collabo-
rating with some excellent ﬁntech companies 
to dramatically improve our digital and other 
customer oﬀerings. I’d like to highlight just 
two new exciting areas:
(cid:228)(cid:3) Developer Services API store – By 
providing direct interfaces with our appli-
cations (fully controlled, of course), we are 
enabling entrepreneurs, partners, ﬁntech 
companies and clients to build new prod-
ucts or services dedicated to speciﬁc needs.
(cid:228)(cid:3) Bill payment and business services – 
While I can’t reveal much at the moment, 
suﬃce it to say there are some interesting 
developments coming as we integrate our 
capabilities with those of other companies.
4. How do we protect customers and their sensitive information while enabling them to share data?
For years, we have been describing the risks 
– to banks and customers – that arise when 
customers freely give away their bank pass-
codes to third-party services, allowing virtu-
ally unlimited access to their data. Customers 
often do not know the liability this may 
create for them, if their passcode is misused, 
and, in many cases, they do not realize how 
their data are being used. For example, access 
to the data may continue for years after 
customers have stopped using the third-party 
services. 
We recently completed a new arrangement 
with Intuit, which we think represents 
an important step forward. In addition to 
protecting the bank, the customers and 
even the third party (in this case, Intuit), it 
allows customers to share data – how and 
when they want. Under this arrangement, 
customers can choose whatever they would 
like to share and opting to turn these selec-
tions on or oﬀ as they see ﬁt. The data will 
be “pushed” to Intuit, eliminating the need 
for sharing bank passcodes, which protects 
the bank and our customers and reduces 
potential liabilities on Intuit’s part as well. 
We are hoping this sets a new standard for 
data-sharing relationships.

5.  What are your biggest geopolitical risks?
Banks have to manage a lot of risks – from 
credit and trading risks to technological, 
operational, conduct and cybersecurity risks. 
But in addition to those, we have exposures 
around the world, which are subject to 
normal cyclical and recession risks, as well  
as to complex geopolitical risks.
There are always geopolitical risks, and 
you can rest assured we are continuously 
reviewing, analyzing and stress testing them 
to ensure that our company can endure them. 
We always try to make certain that we can 
handle the worst of all cases – importantly, 
without disrupting the eﬀective operation of 
the company and its service to our clients. We 
think these geopolitical risks currently are in 
a heightened state – that is, beyond what we 
might consider normal. There are two speciﬁc 
risks I want to point out:
Brexit and the increasing risk to the European 
Union (EU). 
Regarding Brexit, a key concern is to make 
sure our company is prepared to support our 
clients on day one – the ﬁrst day after the 
actual Brexit occurs, approximately two years 
from now. We are conﬁdent we will be able 
to develop and expand the capabilities that 
our EU subsidiaries and branches will need 
to serve our clients properly in Europe under 
EU law. This will require acquiring regulatory 
approvals, transferring certain technologies 
and moving some people. On day one, we 
need to perform all of our critical functions 
at our standards. For example, underwriting 
debt and equity, moving money and accepting 
deposits, and safeguarding the custody assets 
for all of our European clients, including 
many sovereigns themselves. We must be 
prepared to do this assuming a hard exit by 
the United Kingdom – it would be irrespon-
sible to presume otherwise. While this does 
not entail moving many people in the next 
two years, we do suspect that following Brexit, 
there will be constant pressure by the EU not 
I.  THE JP MORGAN CHASE F RANCHI SE 
to “outsource” services to the United Kingdom 
but to continue to move people and capabili-
ties into EU subsidiaries.
We hope that the advent of Brexit would lead 
the EU to focus on ﬁxing its issues – immi-
gration, bureaucracy, the ongoing loss of 
sovereign rights and labor inﬂexibility – and 
thereby pulling the EU and the monetary 
union closer together. Our fear, however, is 
that it could instead result in political unrest 
that would force the EU to split apart. The 
unraveling of the EU and the monetary union 
could have devastating economic and political 
eﬀects. While we are not predicting this will 
happen, the probabilities have certainly gone 
up – and we will keep a close eye on the situa-
tion in Europe over the next several years. 
De-globalization, Mexico and China.
Anti-globalization sentiment is growing in 
parts of the world today, usually expressing 
itself in anti-trade and anti-immigration posi-
tions. (I’m not going to write about immigra-
tion in this letter – we have always supported 
proper immigration – it is a vital part of the 
strength of America, and, properly done, it 
enhances the economy and the vitality of 
the country.) We do not believe globalization 
will reverse course – we believe trade has 
been absolutely critical for growth around 
the world and has beneﬁted billions of 
people. While there are some issues with our 
trade policies that need to be ﬁxed, poorly 
conceived anti-trade policies could be quite 
disruptive, particularly with two of our key 
trading partners: Mexico and China. 
The trade deal with Mexico through NAFTA 
is simpler than the one with China. (In full 
disclosure, JPMorgan Chase is a major inter-
national bank in Mexico, with revenue of 
more than $400 million, serving Mexican, 
American and international clients who do 
business there.) Mexico is a long-standing 
peaceful neighbor, and it is wholly in our 
country’s interest that Mexico be a pros-
perous nation. This actually reduces immi-
gration issues (there are now more Mexicans

Dear Fellow Shareholders,
Jamie Dimon,  
Chairman and  
Chief Executive Officer
Once again, I begin this annual letter to shareholders with a sense of pride about 
our company and our hundreds of thousands of employees around the world. As I 
look back on the last decade — a period of profound political and economic change 
— it is remarkable how much we have accomplished, not only in terms of financial 
performance but in our steadfast dedication to help clients, communities and 
countries all around the world. 
In 2018, we continued to accelerate investments in products, services and 
technology. For example, for the first time in nearly a decade, we extended our 
presence in several states with new Chase branches (we plan to open another 400 
new branches in the next few years). In addition, we started a new digital investing 
platform: You Invest; we launched our partnership with Amazon and Berkshire 
Hathaway in healthcare; we broadened our commitment to create opportunities 
for jobs and prosperity and reduce the wealth gap for black Americans with 
Advancing Black Pathways (announced in February 2019); and we launched our 
2

--- Page 5 ---
AdvancingCities initiative to support job and wage growth in communities most 
in need of capital. While it is too soon to assess the impact of these efforts, we’re 
seeing terrific results so far.
2018 was another strong year for JPMorgan Chase, with the firm generating record 
revenue and net income, even without the impact of tax reform. We earned  
$32.5 billion in net income on revenue1 of $111.5 billion, reflecting strong underlying 
performance across our businesses. Adjusting for the enactment of the Tax Cuts 
and Jobs Act, we now have delivered record results in eight of the last nine years, 
and we have confidence that we will continue to deliver in the future. Each line 
of business grew revenue and net income for the year while continuing to make 
significant investments in products, people and technology. We grew core loans 
by 7%, increased deposits in total by 3% and generally grew market share across 
our businesses, all while maintaining credit discipline and a fortress balance 
sheet. In total, we extended credit and raised capital of $2.5 trillion for businesses, 
institutional clients and U.S. customers.
In last year’s letter, we emphasized how important a competitive global tax system 
is for America. Over the last 20 years, as the world reduced its tax rates, America 
did not. Our previous tax code was increasingly uncompetitive, overly complex, and 
loaded with special interest provisions that created winners and losers. This drove 
down capital investment in the United States, which reduced domestic productivity 
and wage growth. The new tax code establishes a business tax rate that will 
make the United States competitive around the world and frees U.S. companies 
to bring back profits earned overseas. The cumulative effect of capital retained 
and reinvested over many years in the United States will help cultivate strong 
businesses and ultimately create jobs and increase wages. 
For JPMorgan Chase, all things being equal (which they are not), the new lower 
tax rates added $3.7 billion to net income. For the long term, we expect that 
some or eventually most of that increase will be erased as companies compete 
for customers on products, capabilities and prices. However, we did take this 
opportunity in the short term to massively increase our investments in technology, 
new branches and bankers, salaries (we now pay a minimum of $31,000 a year 
for full time entry-level jobs in the United States), philanthropy and lending 
(specifically in lower income neighborhoods).

As you know, we believe tangible book value per share is a good measure of the 
value we have created for our shareholders. If our asset and liability values are 
appropriate — and we believe they are — and if we can continue to deploy this 
capital profitably, we think we can continue to exceed 15% return on tangible 
equity for the next several years (and potentially at or above 17% in the near term), 
assuming there is not a significant downturn. If we can earn these types of returns, 
our company should ultimately be worth considerably more than tangible book 
value. The chart on the bottom of the opposite page shows that tangible book value 
“anchors” the stock price.

Tangible book value over time captures the company’s use of capital, balance sheet and profitability. In this chart, we are looking at 
heritage Bank One shareholders and JPMorgan Chase & Co. shareholders. The chart shows the increase in tangible book value per share;  
it is an after-tax number that assumes all dividends were retained vs. the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (S&P 500 Index), which is a  
pre-tax number that includes reinvested dividends.
1 On March 27, 2000, Jamie Dimon was hired as CEO of Bank One.
In the last five years, we have bought back almost $55 billion in stock or 
approximately 660 million shares, which is nearly 20% of the company’s common 
shares outstanding. In prior letters, I explained why buying back our stock at 
tangible book value per share was a no-brainer. Seven years ago, we offered an 
example of this: If we bought back a large block of stock at tangible book value, 
earnings and tangible book value per share would be substantially higher just four 
years later than without the buyback. While we prefer buying back our stock at 
tangible book value, we think it makes sense to do so even at or above two times 
tangible book value for reasons similar to those we’ve expressed in the past. If we 
buy back a big block of stock this year, we would expect (using analysts’ earnings 
5

--- Page 8 ---
estimates) earnings per share in five years to be 2%–3% higher and tangible book 
value to be virtually unchanged. We want to remind our shareholders that we much 
prefer to use our capital to grow than to buy back stock. I discuss stock buybacks 
later in this letter.

1 On March 27, 2000, Jamie Dimon was hired as CEO of Bank One.
While we don’t run the company worrying about the stock price in the short run, in 
the long run our stock price is a measure of the progress we have made over the 
years. This progress is a function of continual investments, in good and bad times, 
to build our capabilities — our people, systems and products. These important 
investments drive the future prospects of our company and position it to grow 
and prosper for decades. Whether looking back over five years, 10 years or since 
the JPMorgan Chase/Bank One merger (approximately 14 years ago), our stock 
has significantly outperformed the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and the Standard 
& Poor’s Financials Index. And this growth came during a time of unprecedented 
challenges for banks — both the Great Recession and the extraordinarily difficult 
legal, regulatory and political environment that followed.

JPMorgan Chase stock is owned by large institutions, pension plans, mutual funds 
and directly by individual investors. However, it is important to remember that 
in almost all cases, the ultimate beneficiaries are individuals in our communities. 
Well over 100 million people in the United States own stock, and a large 
percentage of these individuals, in one way or another, own JPMorgan Chase 
stock. Many of these people are veterans, teachers, police officers, firefighters, 
retirees, or those saving for a home, school or retirement. Your management 
team goes to work every day recognizing the enormous responsibility that we 
have to perform for our shareholders. 
In the first section of this letter, I try to give a comprehensive understanding of 
how we run our company, including how we think about building shareholder 
value for the long run. In that section, I highlight our strong belief that building 
shareholder value can only be done in conjunction with taking care of employees, 
customers and communities. This is completely different from the commentary 
often expressed about the sweeping ills of naked capitalism and institutions only 
caring about shareholder value.
In the second section of this letter, I comment on important forward-looking issues. 
While we remain optimistic about the long-term growth of the United States and 
the world, the near-term economic and political backdrop is increasingly complex 
and fraught with risks — both known and unknown. And we face a future with less 
overall confidence in virtually all institutions, from corporations to governments 
to the media. The extremely volatile global markets in the fourth quarter of 2018 
might be a harbinger of things to come — creating both risks for our company and 
opportunities to serve our clients. 
The third section of this letter is about public policy, specifically American public 
policy, which is a major concern for our country and, therefore, our company. 
Again, I try to give a comprehensive, multi-year overview of what I see as some of 
our problems and suggest a few ways they can be addressed. One consistent theme 
is completely clear: Businesses, governments and communities need to work as 
partners, collaboratively and constructively, to analyze and solve problems and 
help strengthen the economy for everyone’s benefit.

JPMorgan Chase Principles and Strategies 
1. 
First and foremost, we look at our business from the point of view of the 
customer. 
2.  We endeavor to be the best at anything and everything we do.
3.  We will maintain a fortress balance sheet — and fortress financial principles. 
4.  We lift up our communities.
5.  We take care of our employees.
6.  We always strive to learn more about management and leadership. 
7.  We do not worry about some issues. 
II.  Comments on Current Critical Issues
1.  We need to continue to restore trust in the strength of the U.S. banking system 
and global systemically important financial institutions.
2.  We have to remind ourselves that responsible banking is good and safe banking.
3.  We believe in good regulation — both to help America grow and improve 
financial stability.
4.  We believe stock buybacks are an essential part of proper capital allocation  
but secondary to long-term investing. 
5.  On the importance of the cloud and artificial intelligence, we are all in.
6.  We remain devoted and diligent to protect privacy and stay cyber safe —  
we will do what it takes.
7.  We know there are risks on the horizon that will eventually demand

III.  Public Policy
1. 
The American Dream is alive — but fraying for many.
2.  We must have a proper diagnosis of our problems — the issues are real  
and serious — if we want to have the proper prescription that leads to  
workable solutions.
3.  All these issues are fixable, but that will happen only if we set aside partisan 
politics and narrow self-interest — our country must come first.
4.  Governments must be better and more effective — we cannot succeed without 
their help. The rest of us could do a better job, too.
5.  CEOs: Your country needs you!
6.  America’s global role and engagement are indispensable.

JPM ORG AN  CHAS E PR INCIPLES AND STRATEGIES
In this section, I want to give the reader a comprehensive view of how we run the company. 
We manage the company consistently with these principles in mind – and they have stood 
the test of time. We also strive to satisfy, and even exceed, the requirements of our regu-
lators and governments around the globe – and we think these principles are a critical 
component of that.
1.  First and foremost, we look at our business from the point of view of the customer.
Customer needs are what gets our attention. 
We believe that in a hyper-competitive world 
(from competitors known and unknown), the 
best strategy – both offensive and defensive 
– is to give the customer more: something 
better, faster or more efficiently. We are 
always on a quest to improve our products 
and services, and, for the most part, this is 
done with enhancements in technology and 
through the continual training of our people. 
Most fundamental of all is doing the right 
thing for our customers – in all cases. 
We energetically drive organic growth.
We continue to drive good and healthy 
organic growth (meaning good customers, 
products and services they need and want 
at fair and reasonable prices), and while 
we are happy with our progress, we recog-
nize that we won’t meet every goal we set 
for ourselves and can always do better. In 
past letters, we have identified many areas 
of organic growth. Our achievements with 
these initiatives are detailed in the CEO 
letters in this Annual Report, but a few of 
the critical strategies are highlighted in the 
sidebar below.
ORGANIC GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES ACROSS OUR LINES OF BUSINESS
Consumer & 
Community 
Banking
•  By 2022, we expect 93% of the U.S. population to be in our Chase footprint 
as we expand our branch network to new markets with an integrated 
physical and digital approach. In addition to entering the Washington, D.C., 
Philadelphia and Boston markets in 2018, we recently announced nine new 
markets for 2019, including Charlotte, Minneapolis, Nashville and St. Louis. 
•  The onboarding experience for new customers is being simplified. 
Customers can open a new deposit account digitally in three to five minutes, 
functionality that added approximately 1.5 million new accounts since its 
February 2018 launch; we’re expanding this functionality inside our 
branches as well. We also recently announced Chase MyHome, our new 
digitally enabled mortgage fulfillment process that prefills applications for 
our existing customers. It’s 20% faster than our paper-based process, 
allowing us to close a mortgage within three weeks. Our confidence in our 
enhanced approach is reflected in our money-back guarantee.
10

--- Page 13 ---
•  Customers recently began receiving personalized merchant offers and 
discounts from ChaseOffersSM. This program ramped up rapidly, with 
customers activating 25+ million offers across 7 million cards in the initiative’s 
first three months. CreditJourneySM, with more than 15 million users enrolled, 
has also been a tremendously successful way to engage customers through 
access to credit score information and identity protection. 
•  And later this year, we’ll make it easier for our credit card customers to 
borrow on their existing lines through two new products — My Chase PlanSM, 
allowing customers to finance a specific purchase at a reasonable cost at 
the point of sale; and My Chase LoanSM, letting customers borrow against 
their unused credit limit and pay back their debt in fixed amounts at a 
competitive rate. These products enable us to compete for the approximately 
$250 billion in card loans that our existing customers have with competitors. 
Corporate &  
Investment Bank
•  We have been #1 in investment banking for the past decade and finished 
2018 with 8.7% of global wallet share, the industry’s best. Still, we believe 
we can increase our share over time as we continue to add bankers 
selectively and leverage technology to provide better data and insights  
to our clients. 
•  Our Treasury Services business grew revenue by 13% last year. As we 
further implement our wholesale payments model, which includes merchant 
services, we will be able to deliver a unique value proposition to our clients. 
We see opportunities in every customer segment from middle market and 
small businesses to large corporate clients and their business outside of  
the United States. 
•  We have consistently grown share in Markets — including in businesses 
where the wallet has shrunk. We are prioritizing investments in products 
and technology to stay ahead of our clients’ needs. As companies expand 
their businesses and acquire assets — increasingly across borders — our 
global expertise in hedging risks and protecting capital can be as important 
to them as the actual acquisition. 
•  Our Securities Services business has transformed itself into an industry 
powerhouse, and it sits alongside the world’s leading trading businesses. As 
asset managers face ongoing pressures from passive investing and margin 
compression in the coming years, we think we have a unique opportunity to 
help them become more efficient by outsourcing support functions and 
using our innovative technology platforms. 
•  Our Corporate & Investment Bank is one of the few truly global businesses 
in the financial services industry. As emerging countries take their place on 
the global stage, we will be there to support them. The investments we are 
making in China and in other emerging markets today will result in our 
international growth for years to come. 
11
",Jamie Dimon,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,"The letter states that the Corporate & Investment Bank is a truly global business that supports emerging countries taking their place on the global stage. It explicitly mentions ""The investments we are making in China"" (though the sentence is cut off). This indicates active investment and presence in China as part of their global strategy.","Optimistic growth and active engagement. The company is making investments in China and views it as an important 'emerging country' taking its place globally, which they aim to support and benefit from.",Shareholder Letter

7   REPORT OF THE SUPERVISORY BOARD
Dear Shareholders and Shareholder Representatives,
Despite the persisting sovereign debt crisis in the eurozone and the volatile economic conditions prevail-
ing in several of our major markets, the BMW Group finished yet another financial year with an outstanding 
overall result.
In our capacity as Supervisory Board, we closely monitored the performance of the BMW Group and 
 developments on specific markets throughout the financial year 2012. We duly advised the Board of Manage-
ment in matters of governance and continuously supervised its running of the business with great diligence. 
In this endeavour we laid great store on an open, trusting and constructive exchange of information and 
opinions.
Main emphases of the Supervisory Board’s monitoring and advisory activities  We deliberated regularly 
on the current performance and financial position of the BMW Group in a total of five meetings. Other areas 
reported on and discussed extensively during the year were corporate strategy and planning, risk provision 
and risk management, and corporate governance. We also made decisions with respect to the composition 
of the Board of Management and the allocation of duties to Board of Management members. The Board of 
Management informed us regularly and promptly of sales performance, workforce developments and other 
significant matters, both at scheduled meetings and at other times as the need arose. In addition, the Chair-
man of the Board of Management, Dr. Reithofer, informed me directly about major business transactions and 
projects. Dr. Kley, the Chairman of the Supervisory Board’s Audit Committee, regularly exchanged informa-
tion with Dr. Eichiner, the Board of Management member responsible for Finance and Financial Reporting.
In its regular reports on the financial condition of the Group, the Board of Management provided us with 
detailed descriptions of sales volume performance and market developments for each of the Automotive 
and Motorcycles segments as well as the performance of Financial Services, including new business volumes 
and the development of vehicle residual values on key markets. The Board of Management also regularly 
 reported on the Group’s business activities in China, in particular on the sales situation there, the further 
 expansion of production capacities at the BMW Brilliance joint venture’s manufacturing sites in Dadong and 
Tiexi, and on engine production at the Foresight engine plant opened in Shenyang in April 2012. Further-
more, the Board of Management reported to us regularly on current earnings, profitability and major changes 
in the workforce size. Its business status reports also dealt with major current activities and projects, such 
as ongoing developments in the BMW Peugeot Citroën Electrification joint venture, the status of cooperation 
negotiations and agreements with Toyota in the fields of fuel cells, lightweight-construction, development of 
sports cars as well as in the field of battery technology research. After presentation of reports by the Board of 
Management, the two boards also discussed current challenges such as current economic developments and 
the increasing degree of regulation on a number of markets.
We again gave careful consideration to matters concerning the performance, management and future 
prospects of the Financial Services segment. One of the main focuses of reporting and discussion was the 
segment’s financing model. The Board of Management described the current status of projects and the various 
measures employed to ensure access to financial resources, including, for example, the use of asset-backed 
securities and the expansion of BMW Bank GmbH in Europe.
One of the 2012 Supervisory Board meetings was held at the BMW plant in Leipzig, where we took the 
opportunity to obtain information on the use of carbon-fibre-reinforced plastics (CFRP) in the BMW i family 
of electrically powered vehicles and enquire into the state of preparations for production start-up later this 
year. In the new pressing plant specially constructed for this work, we were treated to a practical demonstration 
of how CFRP mats are processed to form CFRP components.

In preparation for our deliberations on the Long-term Business Forecast, the Board of Management 
 explained the principles applied for planning global added value within the Group in the period up to 2024 
as well as the targets set for the configuration and production capacities of the Group’s plants during this 
 period. Additionally, a raft of measures was presented designed to help limit the scale of investment expenditure 
to be incurred in connection with the expansion of production capacities.
Again in 2012, in both the Personnel Committee and the full Supervisory Board, we examined the com-
pensation of Board of Management members for appropriateness. In doing so, we also evaluated compensation 
studies for the DAX and sought the expertise of an external compensation advisor who was independent of 
both the BMW Group and the members of the Board of Management. Adopting a proposal of the Personnel 
Committee, no changes were made to the Board of Management compensation system in 2012. The rules 
governing the purchase of vehicles and other Group products and the use of vehicles by Board of Management 
members were brought into line with those already in place for top-level department heads. Detailed infor-
mation on the compensation of Board of Management members can be found in the Compensation Report 
(page 170 et seq.).
In the second half of the year we again convened for a two-day meeting primarily devoted to corporate 
and product strategy on the one hand and to the Long-term Business Forecast on the other.
In the first part of the meeting we discussed with the Board of Management the findings of its annual 
 review of the Group’s Strategy Number ONE. In light of current developments, this review included a renewed 
examination and assessment of the impact that could potentially arise from various crisis scenarios of varying 
intensity in regions significant for sales performance.
In its report, the Board of Management also considered the strategic planning of worldwide production 
capacities. In addition to the expansion of production capacities at the Spartanburg and Leipzig plants, the 
Board of Management also presented its plans for future production facility and capacity expansion at other 
locations. The Supervisory Board fully supports the Board of Management in its endeavours to exploit growth 
opportunities in specific regions, whilst at the same time maintaining a well-balanced distribution of sales and 
value added across the world’s markets.
In conjunction with our deliberations on product strategy, the Board of Management and the Head of 
 Design for the BMW Group presented and elaborated on selected vehicle projects. Furthermore, in a dis-
cussion with the head of the i product line, we were informed of the Group’s current activities and the needs 
of customers in the field of electromobility and given an insight into some of the solutions arrived at so far, 
such as for the charging of batteries at home and on the road. At our request, other related service concepts 
currently being developed by the BMW Group were explained to us.
We also took a close look at the latest advances being made in the field of emission reduction and avidly 
discussed, together with the Board of Management both the technical and the entrepreneurial challenges 
that need to be mastered, particularly those ensuing from regulatory provisions or customer expectations with 
regard to urban mobility.
The Supervisory Board remains firm in its conviction that the strategic direction set by the Board of 
Management for the BMW Group is robust and sustainable.
In conjunction with vehicle presentations, Supervisory Board members also had the opportunity to drive 
a number of BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce vehicles, including some BMW models equipped with hybrid and 
electric drive systems.

9   REPORT OF THE SUPERVISORY BOARD
After concluding the Annual Strategy Review, the second part of the meeting included an in-depth 
 discussion of the Long-term Business Forecast drawn up by the Board of Management for the years from 
2013 to 2018 and, after thorough examination, we gave the required approval. The Board of Manage-
ment elucidated changes in sales and financing volumes compared with the previous year’s forecast and 
also explained the potential impact of volume and earnings risks associated with specific scenarios. 
We encouraged the Board of Management in its strategy of maintaining flexibility in terms of cost 
 planning.
We also thoroughly examined the Annual Budget presented by the Board of Management in November 
2012 for the financial year 2013 and discussed the impact of potential economic developments.
We concurred with the decision of the Board of Management to raise the share capital of the Company in 
accordance with Article 4 no. 5 of the Articles of Incorporation (Authorised Capital 2009) by € 422,845 and 
to issue a corresponding number of new non-voting bearer shares of preferred stock, each with a par value 
of € 1, at favourable conditions to employees.
The Board of Management and Supervisory Board jointly examined corporate governance within the 
BMW Group and issued a new Declaration of Compliance, the wording of which is included in the Corporate 
Governance Report (page 153). The BMW Group currently complies with the recommendations of the Govern-
ment Commission on the German Corporate Governance Code (code version dated 15 May 2012, “Code”) 
published on 15 June 2012 with one exception, namely the revised recommendation on the structure of super-
visory board compensation contained in section 5.4.6 paragraph 2 sentence 2 of the Code (“If members of 
the Supervisory Board are promised performance-related compensation, it shall be oriented toward sustain-
able growth of the enterprise”). In this context, and following preparatory work carried out by the Presiding 
Board, we examined various models with the Board of Management with respect to the future compensation 
of the Supervisory Board. A proposed change to the Articles of Incorporation will be put to the shareholders 
at the 2013 Annual General Meeting.
With regard to its own composition, based on a detailed composition profile, the Supervisory Board de-
cided upon specific appointment goals in 2010, which are discussed in detail in the Corporate Governance 
Report (page 164 et seq.). In 2012, in line with section 5.4.1 paragraph 2 of the Code, we set what we consider 
to be an appropriate target for the number of independent members in the Supervisory Board (at least twelve 
of which at least six should represent the shareholders). On the basis of a self-assessment of the full Super-
visory Board and its individual members, we were able to conclude that the composition of the Supervisory 
Board at 31 December 2012 meets that target. No conflicts of interest arose during the year under report on 
the part of members of either the Supervisory Board or the Board of Management. Significant transactions 
with Supervisory Board members and other related parties as defined by IAS 24, including close relatives 
and intermediary entities, are scrutinised on a quarterly basis.
In conjunction with the joint examination of corporate governance, the Board of Management informed 
us (both in the Personnel Committee and in the full Supervisory Board) of the progress made in imple-
menting the BMW Group’s diversity concept, with its focus on gender, cultural background and age / experience. 
In this context, we obtained information from the Board of Management with regard to the proportion of, 
and changes in, management positions held by women, in particular at senior management level and at execu-
tive level below the Board of Management. We concluded that the Code’s requirements for the promotion of 
diversity are also being complied with in terms of management functions, and concur with the Board of 
Management that, in addition to the efforts to improve gender diversity, even more should be done to promote 
cultural diversity and the international character of the workforce.

We endeavour to assess and improve continuously on the effectiveness of the work performed in the 
 Supervisory Board and its committees, not least in consideration of the broader range of tasks for which the 
 Supervisory Board now finds itself responsible. The Chairman of the Audit Committee and myself are 
therefore always pleased to receive comments and suggestions for improvement from Supervisory Board 
members. The formal examination of the Supervisory Board’s efficiency is also treated once each year as a 
separate agenda point which is prepared by means of a questionnaire required to be completed by all Super-
visory Board members.
Each of the five Supervisory Board meetings in 2012 was attended on average by over 90 % of its members, 
a fact that can be tied in to the analysis of attendance fees for individual members disclosed in the Compen-
sation Report. No member of the Supervisory Board missed more than two meetings in his / her period of 
 office during the year. Presiding Board and committee meetings were fully attended in the vast majority of 
cases (page 163).
Description of Presiding Board activities and committee work  In order to work more efficiently and 
prepare complex issues and decisions more thoroughly, the Supervisory Board has established a Presiding 
Board and several committees. A description of the duties, composition and work procedures of these com-
mittees is provided in the Corporate Governance Report (page 160 et seq.).
The relevant committee chairmen provided timely and comprehensive accounts of the work of the 
 Presiding Board and other committees to the full Supervisory Board, as did the chairman of the Nomination 
Committee to the shareholder representatives on the full Supervisory Board.
In a total of four meetings, the Presiding Board focused mainly on the preparation of topics for the meet-
ings of the full Supervisory Board unless this fell under the remit of one of the committees. Complex issues, 
such as the Long-term Business Forecast and the Annual Strategic Review, were dealt with on the basis of 
written and oral reports provided by Board of Management members and senior department heads. In the 
case of financial planning, for example, we arranged for the Board of Management member responsible for 
 Finances to brief us in advance on detailed aspects of the Long-term Business Forecast. The Head of Group 
Strategy and Planning, Environment provided us with facts, assumptions and principles relevant for global 
value added within the Group in the period up to 2024, including the targets and distribution of production 
capacities built into the forecasts, and discussed analyses from the Annual Strategy Review with us. The 
 Presiding Board selected further topics for Supervisory Board meetings and made suggestions to the Board 
of Management regarding items to be included in its reports to the full Supervisory Board.
Two telephone conference calls were also conducted by the Presiding Board in conjunction with current 
activities and projects. In one of those conference calls, the Board of Management and the Head of Product 
and Brand Strategy reported on the current status of cooperation arrangements, in particular the planned 
extension of collaboration with Toyota Motor Corporation. In another telephone conference call, the Board 
of Management explained the plans to sell Husqvarna Motorcycles.
The Audit Committee held three meetings and three telephone conference calls during 2012. In accordance 
with the recommendation of the German Corporate Governance Code, we discussed each of the interim finan-
cial reports with the Board of Management prior to publication. Representatives of the external auditors were 
present for part of the time during the telephone conference call held to present the Interim Financial Report 
for the six-month period to 30 June 2012. The report had been subjected to review by the external  auditors.
One meeting of the Audit Committee was primarily dedicated to preparing the Supervisory Board’s meet-
ing in spring 2012 at which the financial statements were examined. In order to prepare its recommendation

11   REPORT OF THE SUPERVISORY BOARD
to the full Supervisory Board regarding the proposed election of external auditors at the Annual General 
Meeting 2012, the Audit Committee obtained a Declaration of Independence from the proposed external 
 auditor. The Audit Committee also considered the scope and composition of non-audit services, including 
tax advisory services, provided by KPMG entities to the BMW Group. There were no indications of conflicts 
of interest or grounds for exclusion or lack of independence on the part of the auditor. The fee proposals for 
the audit of the year-end Company and Group Financial Statements 2012 and the review of the six-month 
 Interim Financial Report were deemed appropriate by the Audit Committee. Subsequent to the Annual 
 General Meeting 2012 the Audit Committee appointed the external auditor for the relevant engagements and, 
with due consideration to the suggestions made by the full Supervisory Board, specified audit focus areas. 
In relation to the audit of the Company Financial Statements, for example, this included the accounting 
treatment of commodity derivatives and in relation to the audit of the Group Financial Statements this in-
cluded the measurement of interest rate derivatives.
The Head of Group Financial Reporting reported to the Audit Committee on risk management processes 
in place throughout the BMW Group, focusing on the internal control system (ICS) as the basis for financial 
 reporting. We were also provided with a description of planned areas of action and further developments in 
this field.
The Audit Committee considered the set of measures undertaken by the Board of Management in 2012 
to ensure that “compliance” as a concept is fully embedded in the principles of conduct valid for all Group 
employees. The Chairman of the BMW Group Compliance Committee reported to the Audit Committee on 
the current compliance situation, which, as in the previous year, was deemed satisfactory. The Audit Com-
mittee also enquired into the implementation of anti-corruption measures resolved in the previous year, the 
enlargement of the BMW Group Compliance Organisation -- in particular within the Financial Services 
segment -- and the results of sample testing carried out in Germany and abroad.
The Head of Group Internal Audit reported to us in the Audit Committee on the significant findings of 
audits conducted by Group Internal Audit and on the planned areas of focus on the industrial and financial 
services sides of the business.
The Personnel Committee convened four times during the financial year 2012. In preparation for a meet-
ing of the full Supervisory Board, the Personnel Committee reviewed the compensation of Board of Manage-
ment members (including pension benefits) for appropriateness in comparison with other DAX companies. 
Other specific issues relating to employment contracts were also addressed by the Personnel Committee. The 
Personnel Committee gave its approval in one case for a member of the Board of Management to accept a 
mandate for membership of the supervisory board of a non-BMW Group entity.
The Nomination Committee convened once during the financial year 2012, on which occasion it de-
liberated on proposals for candidates for the Supervisory Board elections at the 2013 Annual General Meeting, 
taking account of the composition objectives stipulated for the Supervisory Board.
The statutory Mediation Committee (§ 27 (3) of the Law on Worker Participation) was not required to 
convene during the financial year 2012.
Composition and organisation of the Board of Management  We deliberated with the Board of Manage-
ment on changes to the structure and allocation of portfolio responsibilities with the objective of making the 
best use of individual members’ expertise and strengthening the overall responsibility of the Board of Manage-
ment. In this context, it was decided to establish separate areas of responsibility for the BMW brand on the 
one hand and for the MINI brand, Rolls-Royce Motor Cars and motorcycles business on the other. The new 

--- Page 12 ---
12
structure and allocation of responsibilities resolved by the Board of Management in agreement with the 
 Supervisory Board is depicted in detail in the Corporate Governance Report (page 154). In view of the fact 
that Mr. Krüger was set to take over responsibility for the newly created board portfolio comprising MINI, 
Motorcycles, Rolls-Royce and Aftersales BMW Group, we appointed Milagros Caiña Carreiro-Andree as 
member of the Board of Management and as successor to Mr. Krüger with responsibility for Human  Resources 
and as Industrial Relations Director with effect from 1 July 2012. The composition of the Board of Manage-
ment team was otherwise unchanged during the financial year 2012. No decisions needed to be made in 2012 
with respect to the reappointment of Board of Management members.
Composition of the Supervisory Board, the Presiding Board and Supervisory Board committees  The 
mandate of Franz Oberländer as employee representative on the Supervisory Board ended on 31 May 2012 
when he entered into retirement. On 1 June 2012 the Munich District Court appointed Dr. Dominique 
 Mohabeer, member of the Works Council of BMW AG at the Munich site, to the position of employee repre-
sentative on the Supervisory Board for the remaining term of office. As a result, the proportion of women 
in the Supervisory Board increased to 20 %, in line with the composition objectives set by the Supervisory 
Board.
Anton Ruf, executive staff representative on the Supervisory Board, retired on 31 October 2012, at which 
date he also ceased to be a member of the Supervisory Board. He was succeeded on 1 November 2012 by 
 Oliver Zipse, Head of Brand and Product Strategies, who took over the role of executive staff representative 
on the Supervisory Board for the remaining term of office as elected substitute member. In view of a new 
management position he will have within the BMW Group from 1 April 2013 onwards, Mr. Zipse has resigned 
his mandate on the Supervisory Board with effect from 31 March 2013.
On 29 November 2012 the shareholder representatives in the Supervisory Board elected Susanne Klatten 
as a further member of the Nomination Committee. The composition of the Presiding Board and  other 
 committees of the Supervisory Board remained unchanged during the financial year 2012. The Corporate 
Governance Report includes an overview of the composition of the Supervisory Board and its committees 
(page 155 et seq., page 163).
Examination of financial statements and the profit distribution proposal  KPMG AG Wirtschafts-
prüfungs gesellschaft conducted a review of the abridged Interim Group Financial Statements and Interim 
Group Management Report for the six-month period ended 30 June 2012. The results of the review were 
also reported orally to the Audit Committee. No issues were identified that might indicate that the abridged 
Interim Group Financial Statements and Interim Group Management Report had not been prepared, in all 
material respects, in accordance with the applicable provisions.
The Group and Company Financial Statements of Bayerische Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft for the 
year ended 31 December 2012 and the Combined Group and Company Management Report – as authorised 
for issue by the Board of Management on 19 February 2013 – were audited by KPMG AG Wirtschafts prüfungs-
gesell schaft and given an unqualified audit opinion.
The Financial Statements and Combined Group and Company Management Report, the long-form audit 
reports of the external auditors and the Board of Management’s profit distribution proposal were made 
available to all members of the Supervisory Board in good time. At the meeting held on 1 March 2013 these 
documents were examined and discussed in detail by the Audit Committee. The Supervisory Board subse-
quently examined these documents at its meeting on 14 March 2013, after hearing the committee chairman’s 
report on the meeting of the Audit Committee. In both meetings, the Board of Management gave a detailed 
explanation of the financial reports it had prepared. Representatives from KPMG attended both meetings, 

--- Page 13 ---
13   REPORT OF THE SUPERVISORY BOARD
reported on significant audit findings and answered any additional questions raised by the members of the 
Supervisory Board. The representatives of the external auditors confirmed that the risk management system 
established by the Board of Management is capable of identifying events or developments that might impair 
the going-concern status of the Company and that no material weaknesses in the internal control system and 
risk management system were found with regard to the financial reporting process. Similarly, the external 
auditors confirmed that they had not identified any facts in the course of their work that were inconsistent 
with the contents of the Declaration of Compliance issued jointly by the two boards. Based on own thorough 
examination by the Audit Committee and the full Supervisory Board, we concurred with the results of the 
external audit.
In accordance with the conclusion reached as a result of the examination by the Audit Committee and 
Supervisory Board, no objections were raised.
The Group and Company Financial Statements of Bayerische Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft for the 
financial year 2012 prepared by the Board of Management were approved at the Supervisory Board Meeting 
held on 14 March 2013. The separate financial statements have thus been adopted.
Both in the Audit Committee and in the full Supervisory Board, we examined the proposal of the Board 
of Management to use the unappropriated profit to pay a dividend of € 2.50 per share of common stock and 
€ 2.52 per share of non-voting preferred stock. Taking account of the financial condition of the BMW Group, 
we consider the proposal appropriate and concur with it.
Expression of thanks by the Supervisory Board  We would like to express our gratitude to the members 
of the Board of Management and all employees worldwide for their commitment and contribution to 
 another set of excellent financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2012.
We also wish to extend a special word of thanks to Mr. Oberländer and Mr. Ruf, both of whom left the 
 Supervisory Board in 2012 after many years of dedicated and constructive work in the Supervisory Board. 
In addition to achieving success in their chosen fields of activity, they spent most of their working lives 
 diligently serving both the Company and the employees they represented.

15   STATEMENT OF THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT
Dear Shareholders,
Your Company has once again demonstrated a strong performance with new sales volumes, revenues 
and earnings highs for the 2012 financial year.
At the BMW Group, we look to the future and are prepared to go against the trend, if need be; we have 
the stamina to stick to our chosen path. For us, it is always the customer who comes first – that is why we 
 offer innovative products and services and what makes us the world’s top-selling premium car manufacturer. 
But we aim to do even better – which means continuing to grow at a profitable rate and acting in a responsible 
manner as a member of society.
Our actions are based on our tradition, our values and our Company’s unique corporate culture and team 
spirit. At the BMW Group, we all share a passion for mobility. It is our common purpose to make individual 
mobility viable for the future, as the demands on cars continue to evolve. Our industry is in a period of transi-
tion – what we refer to as “iconic change”. We are driving and shaping this technological shift towards sus-
tainable mobility. It will require all our powers of innovation in the development of new products and attrac-
tive mobility services, as well as constant review of our structures and processes and how we work together.
2012 – the most successful year in the history of the Company.  Our success is built on the desirability 
of our products. More than 1.84 million BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce vehicles were delivered to customers in 
2012, beating the previous year’s record by more than 10 %. All three of our automobile brands set new re-
cords. In addition, more than 117,000 customers purchased a BMW or Husqvarna motorcycle. Our Financial 
Services business also continued to grow and contributed to the positive performance in sales figures.
Thanks to strong demand for our premium vehicles, revenues rose to more than € 76.8 billion and profit 
before tax increased to around € 7.8 billion in the 2012 financial year – both new highs for the Group. The net 
profit of more than € 5.1 billion also represented a new record.
Our financial success allows us the necessary freedom to continue investing in our future. In 2012, our 
 research and development expenses rose to more than € 3.9 billion, mostly in connection with projects to 
secure our future growth.
Our figures for 2012 are the result of an outstanding collective performance. On behalf of the Board of 
Management, I would like to thank all of our employees for their efforts, determination and achievements in 
2012. I would also like to thank our retail organisation, our suppliers and our business partners, who play 
such an important part in the Company’s success.
Five years of Strategy Number ONE: interim targets for 2012 fulfilled.  The success of the 2012 financial 
year is also the result of the long-term decisions we made as part of our Strategy Number ONE.
We presented our strategy to the public back in autumn 2007 – with a vision for the year 2020. The aim  is 
to prepare the BMW Group for the future, as it faces a wide range of different challenges in a changing environ-
ment for individual mobility. Specific measures were implemented in the four strategic areas of “Growth”, 
“Shaping the future”, “Profitability” and “Access to technology and customers”. We also set ourselves ambitious 

--- Page 16 ---
16
interim targets for 2012, including much greater efficiency and higher profitability. For the Automotive seg-
ment, we defined an EBIT margin target of between 8 % and 10 %.
What have we achieved during the first five years of Number ONE?
–  We have become more profitable, and doubled our profit before tax between 2007 and 2012. At the end of 
2012, our EBIT margin in the Automotive segment was above our 8 % and 10 % target range.
–  The price of BMW common stock climbed more than 70 % from the end of 2007 to the end of 2012, while 
Germany’s DAX fell by 5.6 % over the same period.
–  We have leveraged much more than the € 6 billion in efficiency potential originally targeted.
–  In 2007, Efficient Dynamics was already the best technology on the market for lowering fuel consumption 
and CO2 emissions. Back then, we had 27 BMW and MINI models with 140 grams of CO2 per kilometre or 
less. By the end of 2012, the BMW Group fleet included 73 models at or below this level.
Our core model series – the BMW 3 Series, the BMW 5 Series and the BMW 7 Series – are also available as 
full hybrids. Efficient Dynamics continues: we aim to reduce the CO2 emissions of our vehicle fleet by at 
least another 25 % between 2008 and 2020.
–  We have systematically expanded our global production network since 2007 – from 23 production facilities 
in twelve countries to 29 locations in 14 countries by the end of 2012. The most recent example is our new 
Tiexi plant in Shenyang, which we have been operating with our joint venture partner, Brilliance, since 
2012. When we plan a site, we ensure that it sets new standards: Tiexi is the most sustainable vehicle plant 
in China today and one of the most advanced in the world.
Over the past five years, our strategy has proven robust, and shown the way forward under changing 
 external conditions: during the global financial and economic crisis of 2008 and 2009, the BMW Group still 
showed a profit and paid a dividend. In 2010 and 2011, we steered our Company back on track for success – 
initially helped by an economic tailwind, but then maintaining our performance in a challenging and volatile 
environment in 2012.
This clearly shows that we have reached the first major milestone in our strategy. We have fulfilled all the 
interim targets of our Strategy Number ONE for the year 2012 – and, in some cases, exceeded them. We de-
livered on our promises. Today, the BMW Group is a stronger, more international and more future-oriented 
company than it was when we embarked on our Strategy Number ONE. Above all else, the BMW Group is 
an attractive investment – and I would like to thank you, our shareholders, for supporting us on this journey.
It is in all our interests that the BMW Group not only has a successful present, but, even more impor-
tantly, a promising future. For that reason, we are now working towards the next major milestone in our 
strategy.
Number ONE still our corporate compass – next milestone in 2016.  In 2016, we will celebrate 100 years 
of BMW. By then, we aim to sell well over two million BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce brand vehicles – with 
BMW Motorrad and Financial Services also continuing to contribute to our success. Profitability is, and will 
remain, the foundation upon which we build and shape our future.

Dear Shareholders,
P&G’s Purpose–to touch and  
improve lives, now and for generations 
to come–is inspiring and pervasive.  
Our Purpose is tightly and deliberately 
linked to our business and financial 
goals: P&G’s Purpose inspires our 
strategic choices; it leads us to bigger 
and better innovation; it drives brilliant 
execution; and it compels us to make 
a difference in areas such as 
sustainability and social responsibility 
not merely to be a good citizen, but 
more importantly, to create future 
opportunities to touch and improve 
lives–and, in so doing, to keep our 
Company growing.
Robert A. McDonald
Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer

2   The Procter & Gamble Company
Last year, we updated P&G’s growth strategy to connect  
it explicitly to our Company’s Purpose. We focused on three 
specific choices: to grow P&G’s core brands and categories 
with an unrelenting focus on innovation; to build our 
business with unserved and underserved consumers; and  
to continue to grow and develop faster-growing, higher-
margin businesses with global leadership potential. 
These strategic choices are unified by one simple, over-
arching growth strategy: to touch and improve the lives  
of MORE CONSUMERS in MORE PARTS OF THE WORLD, MORE 
COMPLETELY. We’ve made this the centerpiece of our 
leadership agenda because we believe a Purpose-inspired 
growth strategy is intrinsically rewarding and motivating.  
It unleashes creativity, commitment and peak performance  
in P&G people. It attracts talent and partners. It builds 
goodwill with external stakeholders.
  We are executing across all three dimensions of this 
growth strategy on all of our businesses around the world. 
The Company’s performance in the 2010 fiscal year, and the 
strength with which we have entered the 2011 fiscal year, 
demonstrate that our Purpose-inspired growth strategy  
is working.
Substantial Progress toward Growth Goals
We also renewed our growth goals last year. Our fundamental 
objective is the creation of value for shareholders at industry 
leadership levels on a consistent basis. More specifically,  
our goal is to deliver total shareholder return that consistently 
ranks P&G among the top-third of our peers—the best 
performing consumer products companies in the world.  
In addition, we measure our progress through a combination 
of consumer and financial goals. We made substantial 
progress in fiscal 2010:
•  Organic sales grew 3%, in line with Company expectations.(1)
•  Core earnings per share grew 6%, roughly double our 
going-in objective for the year.(2)
•  Adjusted free cash flow was 125% of net earnings, 
well above our target level.(3)
We also made substantial progress toward profitable share 
growth, a key priority. A year ago, our global market share 
was down about half a point versus prior-year levels; today,  
as I write this, our global market share is up nearly half a point 
and accelerating. Last year, we were building market share 
in businesses accounting for only about 33% of sales; today,  
we are building share in brands and countries accounting  
for about 66% of sales and P&G’s market share is growing in 
14 of our top 17 countries. 
In addition, we reached an additional 200 million 
consumers, bringing the total served to 4.2 billion—on track 
toward our goal of reaching 5 billion consumers by fiscal 
2015. Average per capita spending on P&G products increased 
in 70% of our top countries, up from 60% in fiscal 2009. And, 
global household penetration—the percentage of households 
using at least one P&G product—increased nearly two 
percentage points, to 61%.
On the strength of these results, we paid approximately 
$5.5 billion in dividends and returned $6 billion to 
shareholders through the repurchase of P&G stock. Based  
on our current market capitalization, dividends and share 
repurchases provide shareholders with an effective cash  
yield of more than 6%, with additional potential for capital 
appreciation. 
In April, we increased our quarterly dividend by 9.5%, 
making this the 120th consecutive year that P&G has paid a 
dividend and the 54th consecutive year that the dividend has 
increased. Over those 54 years, the dividend has increased at 
an annual compound average rate of approximately 9.5%.

from year-over-year comparisons. See page 49 for a reconciliation of organic sales growth to net sales growth.
(2)  Core EPS is a measure of the Company’s diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations excluding 
charges for potential competition law fines, a charge related to a tax provision for retiree healthcare subsidy 
payments in the recently enacted U.S. healthcare reform legislation and incremental Corporate restructuring 
charges incurred in fiscal 2009 versus 2008 to offset the dilutive impact of the Folgers divestiture. See page 50 
for a reconciliation of Core EPS to diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations.
(3)  Adjusted free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding 
the gains on the divestiture of the global pharmaceuticals business. For 2010, adjusted free cash flow of 
$13,985 million is operating cash flow of $16,072 million less capital spending of $3,067 million plus the tax 
payments made on the gains from the global pharmaceuticals divestitures of $980 million. Adjusted free cash 
flow productivity of 125% is adjusted free cash flow of $13,985 million divided by net earnings of $12,736 
million less gains of $1,585 million from the global pharmaceuticals divestitures.

This is encouraging performance, inspired by the 
Purpose that motivates our people and partners and driven 
primarily by our strong, multiyear innovation program. We 
are innovating to win in every P&G category, we are investing 
behind these innovations to build profitable market share  
and we are continually increasing productivity that funds our 
investments in future growth. This investment allows us to 
continually replenish our multiyear innovation pipeline.
Innovating to Win
Innovation has been—and will continue to be—at the heart 
of our success. In fiscal 2010, for the fourth consecutive year, 
we invested nearly $2 billion in Research & Development. In 
fact, we invest about 50% more than our closest competitor 
and more than most of our closest competitors combined. 
This leadership level of investment is multiplied by our global 
network of external innovation partners, which leads to an 
effective investment in innovation that far exceeds the 
reported spending.
One measure of the strength of our innovation program 
is the SymphonyIRI Group New Product Pacesetters report—
the annual list of the biggest innovations in our industry as 
measured by sales. Over the past 15 years, 125 P&G 
innovations have earned a spot on the Top 25 Pacesetters 
list—more than our six largest competitors combined.
Based on this track record, SymphonyIRI recognized 
P&G as the most innovative manufacturer in the consumer 
packaged goods industry for the last decade—presenting 
the Company with its “Outstanding Achievement in 
Innovation” award. In 2009, P&G launched 5 of the top  
10 most successful non-food innovations as judged by 
SymphonyIRI: Tide Total Care, Gillette Venus Embrace, 
Bounty Extra Soft, Always Infinity and Secret Flawless.  
Our innovation program is guided by the Company's  
Purpose-inspired growth strategy:
•  We are touching and improving MORECONSUMERS’ 
lives by innovating and expanding vertically, up and down 
value tiers.
•  We are touching and improving lives in MOREPARTSOF
THEWORLD by innovating and expanding geographically, 
into new white spaces where we haven’t been competing.
•  We are touching and improving consumers’ lives MORE
COMPLETELY by innovating to improve existing products, 
by creating or entering adjacent categories and by driving 
regimen use that broadens our product portfolios.
We have a strong multiyear pipeline that will continue to 
drive growth in the future. The impact of this innovation 
program is already evident. We have featured six examples  
in the editorial section that follows this letter, but I want to 
share perspective here as well to give you a sense of both 
the strength and breadth of innovation coming from P&G.  
I’ll highlight just three representative businesses to illustrate.
Male Grooming
Fusion has now grown share for 18 consecutive quarters,  
and we recently launched Gillette Fusion ProGlide. Consumer 
testing shows that men prefer the Fusion ProGlide family at  
a ratio of up to 2-to-1 over Gillette Fusion. In the middle  
tier, we recently launched a new Mach3 razor specifically 
designed to better meet the needs of emerging-market 
consumers. As a result, Mach3 shares are at record levels in 
Argentina, Brazil and India.
In February, we launched a complete line of Gillette 
male grooming solutions in Brazil, and are now expanding  
in several Latin American countries. In March, we introduced  
a scientific face care regimen under the Gillette name in 
China. In June, we introduced Gillette Fusion ProSeries in 
North America.
#1most innovative
P&G launched 5 of the top 10 most successful new non-food  
products in 2009, according to SymphonyIRI Group.
SymphonyIRI Group recognized P&G as the most innovative 
manufacturer in the consumer packaged goods industry for the last 
decade with its “Outstanding Achievement in Innovation” award.

Fabric Care
Looking Ahead
We’re expanding our portfolio horizontally with Tide Stain 
Release and Ariel Professional in laundry additives, and 
Bounce Dryer Bar in the fabric enhancer category. We are 
also expanding vertically and into geographic white space.  
In Western Europe, we are innovating in the premium tier 
with Ariel Excel Gel, a new-to-the-world gel that is consumer 
preferred by a margin of 2 to 1. In Japan, our newest laundry 
brand, Sarasa, is priced at a 15% premium versus the 
category average and is designed for consumers who want  
a laundry detergent that cleans well, but also provides 
natural and gentle benefits. 
  We introduced Ace in Colombia during the September 
quarter and Tide Naturals in India during the December 
quarter. Tide Naturals is priced 30% lower than regular  
Tide, enabling us to reach a much broader spectrum of 
Indian households. Ace is a mid-tier laundry brand that 
complements Ariel’s stain removal equity and Bold’s softness 
equity. Ace has become P&G’s 23rd billion-dollar brand. 
Oral Care
Oral-B toothpaste and toothbrush shares in Brazil continue  
to exceed expectations. Based on our in-market success, we 
have initiated the second wave of our toothpaste expansion 
plan which will take us beyond the pharmacy channel.  
The Oral-B toothpaste launch in Belgium and the 
Netherlands is also going well—with Oral-B toothpaste 
approaching double-digit shares and driving P&G to overall 
Oral Care market share leadership in both countries since 
being launched in February 2009.
Crest Pro-Health is off to a strong start in China, helping 
to drive Oral Care shipments in China up high single digits in 
the final quarter of the fiscal year. The Crest Pro-Health 
formula is being expanded to other markets around the 
world, as well. 
In March, we launched Crest 3D White in North America. 
3D White is a new regimen comprised of toothpaste, brush, 
rinse and Professional Effects whitestrips that work in 
combination to clean, whiten and protect teeth while 
providing health benefits expected from Crest and Oral-B.
Many of our most significant innovations just launched in 
North America between March and June 2010. They will 
have a much bigger impact on fiscal 2011 than they had this 
past year as we continue to leverage them in North America 
and to expand them to additional markets. And, of course, 
we will bring new innovations to market. More specifically:
•  Pampers with Dry Max will expand across Western Europe 
this year. 
•  Gillette Fusion ProGlide will roll out to more than 
40 countries over the next two years. 
•  The new Pantene formulations will expand globally over 
the next two years. 
•  We are aggressively working to merge the product 
innovation and geographic expansion plans of Ambi Pur 
with the Febreze franchise, following the close of the  
Ambi Pur acquisition in early July. Our air care business 
now spans 84 countries.
•  Oral Care is introducing a new Crest Clinical line of 
products to treat two of the most common oral care 
problems: gingivitis and tooth sensitivity. The Crest Clinical 
Sensitivity toothpaste provides the maximum strength 
available over the counter. Crest Clinical will start shipping 
in North America in August.
In total, P&G competes in 38 product categories globally, but 
we are not present in all these categories in all of our priority 
markets. For example, as a total Company, we compete in 
less than 50% of potential country/category combinations in 
our top 50 markets. This presents a tremendous growth 
opportunity. Our objective is to fill out our product portfolio 
in every category and then expand to the most relevant 
geographic markets. This objective is driving clear, strategic 
choices about where to innovate and expand to ensure our 
total-Company lineup is reaching more consumers in more 
parts of the world, more completely. 
There are examples in every P&G category. I cite these 
few just to provide perspective on the strength and breadth 
of our innovation program. We currently have the strongest 
multiyear innovation program I’ve seen in my 30-year career 
at P&G. And as strong as the program has been during this 
past fiscal year, we are equally pleased with the quality of our 
pipeline going forward. It’s full of innovations that are sure to 
touch and improve the lives of consumers for years to come.

P&G has paid a dividend for 120 consecutive years—and 2010 
marked the 54th consecutive year of dividend increases.

Investing to Grow, Changing to Lead
We are supporting our innovation program with strong  
levels of marketing investment. We delivered a 20% increase 
in consumer impressions—the number of times consumers 
hear about our brands and new products—this fiscal year, 
with most of the increase in the second half of the fiscal  
year behind many of the innovations I just described.  
This investment is critical. Decades of experience have 
demonstrated that making people aware of our innovation 
and motivating them to try our new products is the key to 
long-term success. When people experience the innovation 
we bring to market, they are frequently delighted, which in 
turn drives repurchase and sustainable share growth. This  
is the foundation of brand building, and P&G is committed 
to investing sufficiently and consistently to support 
innovation and build brands that thrive for decades.
One of the most important ways we fuel investments  
in innovation and brand building is through cost savings and 
productivity improvements. P&G is very disciplined about 
cash management and cost reduction. We are strengthening 
this discipline with a culture that continually simplifies the 
way we work and increases productivity.
Simplification is a significant opportunity for us, 
particularly given the breadth of our business and brand 
portfolios. For example, we have more than 16,000 product 
formulas and use more than 4,000 colors in our product 
labels and plastic packaging. Over the next two years, we 
expect to reduce the number of formulas and package 
specifications by 30% and to reduce the number of colors 
we use by 50–75%. Color simplification alone has the 
potential to generate up to $50 million in annual savings.  
We have simplification projects underway throughout the 
Company, led by line management and managed with the 
same discipline and integration that we use for global 
product launches. This will remain an ongoing priority for us.
Another good example of how we’re becoming more 
productive is the “digitization” of P&G. With digitization, our 
goal is to standardize, automate and integrate systems and 
data so we can create a real-time operating and decision-
making environment. We want P&G to be the most 
technology-enabled company in the world. 
  We are targeting a 20–25% reduction in some spending  
areas and we are looking for a sevenfold increase in  
real-time data. By getting the right data to the right decision 
makers at the right time, we can become increasingly 
efficient and productive.
$2 billion

A good illustration is logistics. We are digitizing our 
Transportation Management systems, including what we call 
our “Control Tower.” Think of this as an “air traffic control 
system” for ground transportation. The real-time information 
this system provides allows us to coordinate scheduling  
and truck movement for all inbound and outbound 
transportation. So far, we’re on track to reduce the number 
of “deadhead legs”—or, empty truck shipments—by more 
than 15%. We currently have control tower approaches  
in place covering about one-quarter of our business in both 
developing and developed markets. We think increasing  
the capacity utilization of trucks can save more than  
$200 million annually.
Another way we are increasing productivity is by turning  
the Company’s size into scale and our scale into growth. To 
do this, we are increasingly competing as one Company. Our 
individual categories, brands, countries and functions are all 
critical and each has unique value to add. But at the total-
Company level, we can create scale advantages by allocating 
resources more strategically and efficiently than any individual 
business can do on its own. The combination of the 
individual components is greater together as one Company 
than the sum of the parts—and we are focused on 
maximizing this total value.
  We are working across our businesses and markets to 
leverage P&G scale. A good example is the global sponsorship 
agreement we signed in July with the International Olympic 
Committee (IOC). The partnership gives P&G global 
sponsorship rights for the next five Olympic Games, from 
London 2012 through the 2020 Olympic Games, enabling  
the Company to take the Games to the more than 4 billion 
consumers worldwide served by P&G brands today. The 
breadth of P&G’s portfolio and the depth of our reach  
make this the most far-reaching Olympic partnership. It 
demonstrates the powerful appeal of our brand portfolio and 
its tremendous global scale. No other consumer products 
company could create a comparable partnership with the IOC.

As part of this sponsorship, we also announced the 
global expansion of our Proud Sponsor of Moms campaign. 
We will build upon the success of our Team USA partnership 
at the Vancouver 2010 Olympic Winter Games, which 
resulted in increased favorability ratings for P&G and our 
brands, greater market share and nearly $100 million in 
incremental sales. P&G will leverage the IOC partnership to 
deliver on our growth strategy and to help improve the lives 
of athletes, moms and their families around the world in 
several ways:
•  We will continue to support families of Olympians, 
reapplying on-site activities from the Vancouver 2010 
Olympic Winter Games.
•  As part of the Proud Sponsor of Moms campaign, our 
Thank You, Mom program will continue in conjunction 
with the IOC’s inaugural Youth Olympic Games to be held 
in Singapore in August 2010, helping 25 moms of Youth 
Olympians from around the world with their travel and 
lodging costs so they can be in Singapore with their 
children as they compete.
•  We will produce a documentary video series called “Raising 
an Olympian, The P&G Momumentary Project” to celebrate 
the dedication and sacrifice of moms, families and their 
Olympians. The video series will tell the stories of Olympians 
as seen through the eyes of their moms. It will be shown 
leading up to and during the London 2012 Olympic Games 
and will aim to answer the question, “What does it take  
to raise an Olympian?”
By leveraging P&G scale and competing more effectively as 
one Company —rather than as individual businesses and 
brands alone—we are able to touch and improve more lives 
while creating meaningful competitive advantage.
Work to Do
While we are encouraged by the Company’s recent 
performance, I don’t want to imply that we are satisfied.  
Our results were ahead of our going-in expectations in nearly 
every area, but we still have some significant opportunities 
for improvement. 
Our results on some big brands and in some big 
categories have been soft. We are not yet growing share on 
every business but we have robust innovation and marketing 
plans in place to accelerate share growth across the 
portfolio. 
  We also need to continue our disciplined cost reduction 
and cash management efforts. We need to take even more 
cost out because there are still more investments we need 
to put in to keep driving profitable market share growth.
If we build on our successes, address our shortfalls  
and implement our strategy with excellence—which is 
precisely what we are focused on doing—we will continue 
to accelerate growth on both the top- and bottom-line, and 
we expect this to be reflected in stronger market share trends.
Inspired to Perform
As I wrote at the beginning of this letter, we have placed 
significant emphasis on P&G’s Purpose because we believe it 
inspires people to perform at their peak. 
Fulfilling P&G’s Purpose is not merely a noble ideal. It  
is potentially a game-changing growth strategy because it 
unleashes creativity and capability. Our purpose as individuals 
inspires our performance as professionals. The congruence  
of our Company Purpose and our personal purpose captures 
our imagination and passion. It focuses us on the consumers 
we serve and inspires empathy for them that, in turn, leads  
to insights, big ideas and innovation that drive growth.  
Simply put: Touching and improving people’s lives motivates 
peak performance. I believe that to my core.
Everywhere I travel, P&G people and our partners tell 
me they are inspired by what we can accomplish together. 
They tell me that they are inspired by the thought of what 
we can accomplish if we can infuse the work of our entire 
organization—all 127,000 of us—with the meaning that 
comes from our Purpose. We’re inspired by the thought of 
serving five billion people by the middle of this decade, and 
perhaps touching and improving the lives of nearly every 
person on the planet in our lifetimes. We’re inspired to 
create new innovations, ideas, services and products that 
improve people’s lives in ways we’ve not yet foreseen.
It is all this, taken together, that drives my confidence in 
P&G’s future. We have all the elements of a high-performing 
organization in place at P&G: passionate leaders at every 
level and in every part of our business; sound strategies that 
continue to provide abundant opportunities to grow; robust 
systems that enable us to operate with discipline and to 
collaborate inside and outside the Company; and a culture 
that enables, demands and rewards high performance. These 
pillars stand on a foundation of technical competence and 
the bedrock strength of our Purpose, Values and Principles 
that constitute the core of P&G. 
I am honored to stand alongside Purpose-inspired 
leaders in every part of our organization who ensure that 
P&G touches and improves lives every day. It is a privilege  
to work with such outstanding people and I thank them for 
all they are doing to touch and improve lives and to grow 
our business.

Dear shareholders, customers, partners and colleagues:   
It’s been a remarkable year for all of us at Microsoft, a year of change and opportunity for our company, our industry 
and the world.  
We as a company stand for deeply understanding the needs of customers, translating that understanding into products 
that people love and ultimately into the success our customers have with our products. It’s that last part that is our key 
motivation. The entire Microsoft team is inspired to bring their best ideas and efforts every day to build products people 
love, and to advance our mission to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. 
And we’re seeing the impact.  
We  sharpened  our  focus  this  past  fiscal  year,  prioritizing  our  talent  and  investments  in  areas  where  we  have 
differentiation and potential for growth. We executed with financial discipline, with revenue of $93.6 billion, $60.5 billion 
of gross margin, $18.2 billion in operating income and $12.2 billion in net income. And we significantly increased our 
total cash return to shareholders by nearly 50 percent to $23.3 billion.  
We  also  made  key  decisions  that  are  moving  us  forward  as  the  company  that  builds  best-in-class  platforms  and 
productivity services for our mobile-first, cloud-first world.  
•   We launched Windows 10 as a service that unites your experience across a wide range of devices with 
innovations that increase productivity and flexibility while remaining familiar.   
•   Surface  is proving that consumers  and  businesses alike want a  tablet  that can replace their laptop. We 
achieved $3.6 billion in Surface revenue  – equally gratifying is the fact that Surface won fans while also 
creating a new hardware category.  
•  We restructured our phone business, as we aligned our first-party hardware portfolio into the larger Windows 
ecosystem.  Going  forward  we  will  focus  on  building  premium,  flagship  phones  for  Windows  fans  and 
commercial customers.  
•  We delivered Office everywhere on all devices, and Office 365 consumer subscriptions grew to more than 
15 million,  adding  nearly  10 million  subscribers  in  the  fiscal  year.  Commercial  customers  are  rapidly 
adopting this service with seats growing by 74 percent.   
•   Azure cloud platform revenue and compute usage increased by over 100 percent in the fourth quarter year 
over year.  
•   We are gaining ground in business process applications with triple-digit growth of the Dynamics CRM Online 
installed base and the overall Dynamics business growing revenue by double digits.   
•   We delivered innovative new cloud services at an increasing pace spanning enterprise mobility, big data, 
cloud infrastructure and application developer services.   
In  this  year’s  letter,  I  want  to  look  forward  and  paint  a  picture  of  how  we’re  building  on  this  momentum  while  also 
reflecting on what we’ve learned.

Empowerment.  Microsoft,  since  its  founding,  has  stood  for  individual  and  organizational  empowerment.  What’s 
different about our company when compared with the  industry  is that we make things that  help other people make 
things.  We  also  help  them  make  things  happen.  We  are  well  poised  to  ignite  a  new  revolution  in  which  digital 
technologies  democratize  access  to  people  across  economic  strata,  organizations  of  all  sizes,  entrepreneurs, 
researchers  and  students  everywhere.  This  is  empowerment.  To  deliver  on  this  promise  of  empowerment,  we’ve 
galvanized around three interconnected ambitions that will, in turn, drive our segment financial reporting this fiscal year.   
1)  Reinvent  productivity  and  business  processes.  We  are  helping  customers  be  even  more  effective  with  their 
individual time, while bringing together the power of teams and entire organizations to drive business outcomes and 
success. Time is quickly becoming our scarcest commodity, and people and organizations need the right tools and 
services that help them achieve increasingly complex and challenging outcomes more quickly than ever.   
We are building an array of productivity, communications, collaboration and business process applications so that they 
are optimized for what our users want to achieve rather than being bound to any current product category definitions. 
We let  you pick  up any device and create, collaborate,  communicate or do  business  using our cloud  services.  We 
enable you to complete your sales order by connecting seamlessly to CRM data within Outlook. We enable you to co-
author in real time a student paper with a classmate or an RFP response with colleagues across your organization. 
We empower transparent communications and discovery of enterprise knowledge using tools such as Yammer, Delve 
and Power BI. Skype and Skype for Business enable  you to  have effective meetings with customers, partners and 
colleagues anywhere, anytime.  
Here is a case in point. London’s Metro Bank is reinventing the way banking works. Metro colleagues guide customers 
through  important  financial  decisions  using  Dynamics  CRM  Online,  Office  365,  Power  BI  and  Skype  for  Business. 
Customers like Metro are proving that we are at the dawn of a new generation, one with productivity and business 
process  systems  that  fundamentally  changes  the  nature  of  work,  and  more  importantly  drives  superior  business 
outcomes.  
Looking ahead, we’re poised for new growth given our bold ambition in this space. With Office 2016 and Office 365, 
we will continue to enrich the features and capabilities to help people create and communicate. As an example, many 
Office 365 customers will now get rich new voice capabilities with Skype for Business and other new features that have 
enabled  us to expand  our market opportunity for Office 365 by more than $50 billion.  The CRM and ERP markets 
combined are over $60 billion, and represent a massive opportunity for reinvention as they shift to the cloud and mobile 
experiences.  
2) Build the intelligent cloud platform. Microsoft is building a cloud platform that enables the world’s applications to 
become intelligent using the next-generation infrastructure, data and developer services.   
We are unique in that we are the only company building out a hyper-scale public cloud while also meeting customer 
needs for private cloud and hybrid solutions. The Azure cloud platform is now available in 140 countries with over 20 
datacenter regions, more than any other public cloud. We are the first multinational company to operate a public cloud 
in China. Even as organizations transition to the cloud, we continue to see impressive growth in our server business 
with Windows Server, System Center Server and SQL Server. Our servers are the leading edge of this intelligent cloud, 
and this is important because there are going to be many legitimate reasons for people wanting digital sovereignty. We 
believe this is the future of true distributed computing infrastructure, designed to meet the needs and complexities of 
the real world.  
Microsoft Enterprise Mobility had a breakout year, and now more than 17,000 customers are using the service. EMS 
delivers infrastructure for enterprises of all sizes to manage and secure all of their identities, applications, data and 
devices. In doing so, EMS enables a new way for organizations to work in a world where they are increasingly mobile 
and using SaaS services.

--- Page 4 ---
We  are  helping  transform  businesses  through  the  use  of  data.  Cortana  Analytics  Suite  provides  customers  and 
application developers with a fully managed big data and analytics suite that transforms data into intelligent action. 
These capabilities are being used by customers across the full spectrum of industries throughout the economy. And 
we are capitalizing on the advent of the Internet of Things and the associated changes in business models that require 
increasingly advanced cloud data and analytics capabilities.   
We made tremendous progress in our developer engagement this past year by delivering new innovative services to 
developers across all device platforms and also opening our technology to create more participation from open source 
communities. Visual Studio Online now provides a leading set of services for modern development.   
I am excited about the growth opportunities ahead. We’ve broadened our addressable market by building and acquiring 
technologies in key growth categories like security, data and analytics, while also delivering greater integration and 
support for Linux and open source technologies such as Docker containers and Hadoop. Security is a key priority for 
our enterprise customers and represents a $30 billion market opportunity. Likewise, business intelligence and analytics 
is another rapidly growing market for us with an opportunity of more than $15 billion. We are expanding our datacenter 
presence  to  India  and  Canada,  and  will  evaluate  future  expansion  opportunities  as  well. We  also  have  major  new 
releases planned across Windows Server and SQL Server in the coming year that will provide continued opportunity 
for growth and include innovations developed in our public cloud to empower customers’ IT and developer teams to 
achieve more.  
3) Create more personal computing. Our ambition is to make your Windows experience, whether at home or at work, 
more natural, more mobile, and more trusted. Whether using our devices for productivity, gaming, browsing or anything 
else, we want to move customers from needing, to choosing, to loving Windows.   
With the launch of Windows 10, we’re just at the start of a new era of computing that’s more personal, focused on the 
mobility of human experiences across devices. Innovations such as Continuum on Lumia phones running Windows 
10,  for  example,  enable  you  to  simply  take  your  phone  and  attach  it  to  a  screen  and  keyboard  providing  robust 
productivity experiences so your phone can function as a laptop. Windows 10 is more personal and more productive 
with Cortana, Office and universal apps. Windows 10 is delivering truly breakthrough new experiences, like inking on 
our new browser, Microsoft Edge, and gaming across Xbox and PCs. It also opens up entirely new device categories 
such as HoloLens. Security and trust are essential. Windows 10 is safe, secure and always up to date. And it provides 
a single device management platform across all devices, from phones, to laptops, to Internet of Things devices.  
We’re excited and appreciative to see the enthusiastic response to Windows 10 with more than 110 million devices 
already active with the latest Windows.  
Going forward, I believe we will broaden our economic opportunity and return Windows to growth. This holiday, we will 
see the widest range ever of Windows devices, including hundreds of new hardware designs from our partners. With 
Surface, our vision that customers would want a tablet that can replace a laptop has added to the Windows ecosystem 
and created new opportunities for our partners to innovate. We’ll also grow through monetization opportunities across 
the  commercial  and  consumer  spaces.  In  the  enterprise,  customers  will  continue  to  value  our  unparalleled 
management, security and servicing capabilities. And for consumers, Windows 10 creates monetization opportunities 
with Store, search and gaming.

New growth. With all of this new innovation hitting the market, we are on track to reach two important goals for fiscal 
year 2018: a commercial cloud revenue  annual  run rate of $20 billion and 1 billion Windows  10 active devices  per 
month.  
Our approach to growth is simple – we’ll make products and services that are differentiated in markets that are large 
and growing and pioneer new categories. We’ll continue the transition from a transactional relationship with customers 
to one that recognizes the more consistent, lifetime value of a customer. Each of our three ambitions positions Microsoft 
to increase the lifetime value of our customers and win new customers in every part of the world. We work hard to earn 
the trust you’ve shown with your investment. Our past success and ongoing execution make it possible for us to deliver 
the financial performance, strength of balance sheet and return of capital today. It’s our passion for innovation and 
ambition in rapidly growing markets is what has the potential to deliver new value long into the future.   
Culture. Simply stated, I want Microsoft to be the greatest place to work for smart people who are hungry to make a 
difference. It’s been said that culture is the widening of the mind and of the spirit. We spend far too much of our lives 
at work not to find deep meaning in what we do. The broad aperture of our mission and appetite for growth invites 
diversity in all delineations so all employees can uniquely contribute and bring their best every day. When people are 
doing what they love and pursuing a mission they believe in with a growth mindset, I know both great innovation and 
growth will happen.  
When I first started in my new role last year I told employees it was time for us to rediscover our soul – what makes us 
unique.  In  “The  Soul  of  a  New  Machine,”  author  Tracy  Kidder  shows  us  that  technology  is  nothing  more  than  the 
collective soul of those who built it. The technology is fascinating, but even more fascinating is the profound obsession 
of its designers. In the year ahead we will continue to ask ourselves what are the challenges mankind faces, how can 
technology help, and what is the contribution of Microsoft? We can clearly see that there’s a transformation underway 
in our business and renewed spirit in our hallways. We are just starting to get a glimpse of how Microsoft technology 
empowers customers to succeed and make their own difference in the world. We are eager to see what we can do in 
the year ahead to drive greater growth and greater impact in our world.

in share repurchases. The share repurchase program became effective on October 1, 2013, has no expiration date, 
and may be suspended or discontinued at any time without notice. This share repurchase program replaced the share 
repurchase program that was announced on September 22, 2008 and expired on September 30, 2013. As of June 30, 
2015, $21.9 billion remained of our $40.0 billion share repurchase program. All repurchases were made using cash 
resources.

BUSINESS DESCRIPTION  
GENERAL  
Our vision  
Microsoft is a technology company whose mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet 
to achieve more. Our strategy is to build best-in-class platforms and productivity services for a mobile-first, cloud-first 
world.  
The  mobile-first,  cloud-first  world  is  transforming  the  way  individuals  and  organizations  use  and  interact  with 
technology.  Our  worldview  for  mobile-first  is  not  about  the  mobility  of  devices;  it  is  centered  on  the  mobility  of 
experiences that,  in turn, are orchestrated  by the cloud. Cloud computing  and  storage  solutions provide  users and 
enterprises with various capabilities to store and process their data in third-party data centers. Mobility encompasses 
the  rich  collection  of  data,  applications,  and  services  that  accompany  our  customers  as  they  move  from  setting  to 
setting in their lives. We are transforming our businesses to enable Microsoft to lead the direction of this transformation, 
and enable our customers and partners to thrive in this evolving world.   
What we offer  
Founded in 1975, we operate worldwide and have offices in more than 100 countries. We develop, license, and support 
a wide  range of  software products,  services, and devices that  deliver  new  opportunities, greater convenience, and 
enhanced value to  people’s lives. We offer an array of services, including cloud-based services, to consumers and 
businesses. We design, manufacture, and sell devices that integrate with our cloud-based services, and we deliver 
relevant online advertising to a global audience.  
Our products include operating systems for computing devices, servers, phones, and other intelligent devices; server 
applications  for  distributed  computing  environments;  cross-device  productivity  applications;  business  solution 
applications; desktop and server management tools; software development tools; video games; and online advertising. 
We also design and sell hardware including PCs, tablets, gaming and entertainment consoles, phones, other intelligent 
devices,  and  related  accessories.  We  offer  cloud-based  solutions  that  provide  customers  with  software,  services, 
platforms, and content. We also provide consulting and product and solution support services, and we train and certify 
computer system integrators and developers.   
The ambitions that drive us  
To carry out our strategy, our research and development efforts focus on three interconnected ambitions:   
•  Reinvent productivity and business processes.   
•  Build the intelligent cloud platform.  
•   Create more personal computing.  
Reinvent productivity and business processes  
We  believe  we  can  significantly  enhance  the  lives  of  our  customers  using  our  broad  portfolio  of  communication, 
productivity,  and  information  services  that  spans  devices  and  platforms.  Productivity  will  be  the  first  and  foremost 
objective, to enable people to meet and collaborate more easily, and to effectively express ideas in new ways. We will

With  56,000  units  delivered,  the  Volkswagen  ID.3  was  the 
Group’s most successful electric vehicle in 2020, followed by 
the  Audi  e-tron  and  the  Porsche  Taycan. We  intend  to  invest 
around €35 billion in e-mobility over the next five years, plus 
another  €11 billion  in  the  hybridization  of  our  model  port-
folio. Five years ago we gave the green light for e-mobility in 
the  Group  through  the  decision  to  develop  the  Modular 
Electric Drive Toolkit (MEB). Now this is a core business. 
Last  year,  we  significantly  lowered  the  emissions  of  the 
Group’s  fleet  in  Europe  compared  with  the  previous  year.  In 
2021,  when  the  electric  campaign  is  well  underway  with 
models such as the ŠKODA Enyaq iV, we will meet the EU’s CO2 
fleet  targets  and  will  go  from  strength  to  strength  in  sub-
sequent years – until we can trade our excess carbon credits for 
a profit in the near future.  
We  continued  our  40-year  success  story  in  China,  primarily 
with a view to achieving zero-emission mobility. By increasing 
our stake in the Volkswagen (Anhui) joint venture to 75%, we 
are  accelerating  electrification  in  our  largest  market.  We 
announced our intention to become the largest shareholder in 
Chinese  battery  maker  Gotion  by  acquiring  26%  of  this 
company. These and other endeavors are helping us to expand 
our battery expertise at a global level.  
The  new  European  Green  Deal  will  increase  Volkswagen’s 
battery requirements in 2030. To achieve the political climate 
targets,  all-electric  vehicles  will  have  to  make  up  55%  of  our 
deliveries  in  Europe –  significantly  more  than  previously 
projected.  This  also  means  that  in  addition  to  our  battery 
manufacturing  facility  in  Salzgitter,  we  will  need  two  more 
battery plants in Europe. Volkswagen is prepared for this – and 
supports  the  Green  Deal  as  well  as  the  Paris  Climate  Agree-
ment. 
Our commercial vehicle division TRATON is planning to invest 
€1 billion in electrification by 2025. It is important to note that 
emissions can be reduced faster in freight transport and local 
public transport than in the car fleet – using only a fraction of 
the resources. The global champion strategy was advanced in 
2020: TRATON established an e-mobility joint venture in Japan 
and announced the acquisition of US manufacturer Navistar, 
while Scania launched its first production facility in China. The 
groundwork for enhanced efficiency in Germany is being laid 
at the same time: MAN started to increase its competitiveness 
through  restructuring  to  be  better  positioned  for  the  trans-
formation, because there will also be electric and self-driving 
trucks and buses. 
into  a  hospital.  In  Spain,  SEAT  manufactured  respiratory 
equipment. ŠKODA in the Czech Republic and Lamborghini in 
Italy  produced  surgical  masks  and  face  shields.  The  Group 
provided  €40 million  worth  of  relief  supplies,  sought  out 
producers in China and arranged transport to Europe.  
At  the  same  time,  we  were  able  to  ensure  safe  working 
conditions  in  production  with  a  100-point  plan,  maintain 
global  supply  chains,  and  safeguard  our  liquidity,  primarily 
through  targeted  warehouse  management.  Volkswagen 
showed  itself  to  be  robust  and  capable  of  excellent  perfor-
mance in a year that saw the biggest crisis in decades. As of the 
close  of  the  year,  the  Group  recorded  around  15%  fewer 
deliveries  year-on-year,  but  saw  its  global  market  share 
increase slightly. Operating profit before special items came to 
€10.6  billion  in  2020.  Net  liquidity  of  €26.8 billion  –  an 
increase  of  25.9%  year-on-year  –  underscores  the  Group’s 
outstanding solidity. 
I  am  very  proud  of  what  our  more  than  660,000  employees 
have achieved in these challenging times. While balancing the 
pandemic  and  our  transformation,  we  achieved  the  best 
sentiment  rating  in  the  annual  employee  survey.  We  have 
implemented positive changes in our corporate culture. This 
was also confirmed in September 2020 by the final report of 
the team of the US Monitorship, with which we worked for four 
years  on  improving  processes,  creating  more  transparency 
and reducing hierarchical thinking in the Group. I would like 
to sincerely thank our employees for their hard work. Thanks 
also to you, our shareholders, for your support.  
In 2021, following changes on the boards of management of 
our  brands  and  with  Murat  Aksel,  Arno  Antlitz  and  Thomas 
Schmall as new members of the Group Board of Management, 
we  are  starting  out  with  a  new,  powerful  team.  I  will  consis-
tently remain committed to securing a higher return from our 
traditional  business  and  concentrating  fully  on  software 
expertise.  There  is  a  lot  to  do  at  Volkswagen,  to  decide,  to 
change – for we will undergo more transformation in the next 
ten years than we did in the last fifty.   
The  transformation  to  a  climate-neutral,  software-driven 
mobility group will progress quickly in 2021. I look forward to 
your continued support on this journey! 
Sincerely, 
In  2020,  a  year  overshadowed  by  Covid-19,  many  of  our 
employees worked for the common good to help contain the

The Goldman Sachs Business Principles
We constantly strive to anticipate 
the rapidly changing needs of our 
clients and to develop new services 
to meet those needs.
We know that the world of ﬁ nance will 
not stand still and that complacency 
can lead to extinction.
We regularly receive conﬁ dential 
information as part of our normal 
client relationships.
To breach a conﬁ dence or to use 
conﬁ dential information improperly or 
carelessly would be unthinkable.
Our business is highly competitive, 
and we aggressively seek to expand 
our client relationships.
However, we must always be fair 
competitors and must never denigrate 
other ﬁ rms.
Integrity and honesty are 
at the heart of our business.
We expect our people to maintain high 
ethical standards in everything they do, 
both in their work for the ﬁ rm and in 
their personal lives.
Our clients’ interests 
always come ﬁ rst.
Our experience shows that if we 
serve our clients well, our own 
success will follow.
Our assets are our people, 
capital and reputation.
If any of these is ever diminished, the 
last is the most difﬁ cult to restore. We 
are dedicated to complying fully with 
the letter and spirit of the laws, rules 
and ethical principles that govern us. 
Our continued success depends upon 
unswerving adherence to this standard.
Our goal is to provide superior 
returns to our shareholders.
Proﬁ tability is critical to achieving 
superior returns, building our capital, 
and attracting and keeping our best 
people. Signiﬁ cant employee stock 
ownership aligns the interests of our 
employees and our shareholders.
We take great pride in the 
professional quality of our work.
We have an uncompromising 
determination to achieve excellence 
in everything we undertake. Though 
we may be involved in a wide variety 
and heavy volume of activity, we 
would, if it came to a choice, rather 
be best than biggest.
We stress creativity and 
imagination in everything we do.
While recognizing that the old way may 
still be the best way, we constantly 
strive to ﬁ nd a better solution to a 
client’s problems. We pride ourselves 
on having pioneered many of the 
practices and techniques that have 
become standard in the industry.
We make an unusual effort to 
identify and recruit the very best 
person for every job.
Although our activities are measured in 
billions of dollars, we select our people 
one by one. In a service business, 
we know that without the best people, 
we cannot be the best ﬁ rm.
We offer our people the opportunity 
to move ahead more rapidly than is 
possible at most other places.
Advancement depends on merit and 
we have yet to ﬁ nd the limits to the 
responsibility our best people are able 
to assume. For us to be successful, 
our men and women must reﬂ ect the 
diversity of the communities and cultures 
in which we operate. That means 
we must attract, retain and motivate 
people from many backgrounds and 
perspectives. Being diverse is 
not optional; it is what we must be.
We stress teamwork 
in everything we do.
While individual creativity is always 
encouraged, we have found that team 
effort often produces the best results. 
We have no room for those who put their 
personal interests ahead of the interests 
of the ﬁ rm and its clients.
The dedication of our people to 
the ﬁ rm and the intense effort 
they give their jobs are greater 
than one ﬁ nds in most other 
organizations.
We think that this is an important 
part of our success.
We consider our size an asset 
that we try hard to preserve.
We want to be big enough to undertake 
the largest project that any of our clients 
could contemplate, yet small enough to 
maintain the loyalty, the intimacy and the 
esprit de corps that we all treasure and 
that contribute greatly to our success.

Fellow Shareholders:
Throughout most of 2017, the global economy generally expanded, reflecting 
growth in both developed and emerging market economies. In the United 
States, the economic recovery continued into its ninth year as the labor market 
steadily improved. Euro area economies strengthened even as measures of 
inflation remained subdued. In Asia, Japan experienced solid growth, boosted 
by the strength of its exports, while China grew robustly, in part due to the 
global recovery and the success of past policy changes.
For Goldman Sachs, generally higher asset prices and 
tighter credit spreads were supportive of mergers and 
underwriting as well as investing and lending activities. 
At the same time, low levels of volatility served as a 
headwind for our market-making businesses.
The diversity of our net revenue mix was instrumental  
in our performance for the year, with three of our four 
segments producing solid revenue growth leading to  
an overall increase in our net revenues. In 2017, we 
generated net revenues of $32.1 billion, a five percent 
increase over 2016. During 2017, the Tax Cuts and  
Jobs Act (U.S. Tax Legislation) was enacted, resulting  
in a $4.4 billion one-time estimated income tax expense. 
Excluding this expense, net earnings applicable to 
common shareholders grew 14 percent to $8.1 billion, 
diluted earnings per common share of $19.76 were  
21 percent higher and our return on average common 
shareholders’ equity (ROE) was 10.8 percent.1
We have delivered double-digit ROE in five out of the 
last six years, and for that sixth year, our ROE was  
9.4 percent.2 While we may not have a contract to deliver 
double-digit returns in every possible circumstance,  
our focus and intensity, including the way we manage 
expenses, demonstrate the importance we attach to 
shareholder returns.
Inflection Points
This past year represented several points of inflection  
for our business and the industry. First, we appear to  
be moving from an environment of generally lower 
economic growth to one with stronger global growth  
and tighter labor markets. Second, central banks are 
shifting away from extraordinarily accommodative 
monetary policies — policies which have dampened 
market volatility — to, generally, more “normal” 
approaches. And third, we may be transitioning from  
an intense period of increasing layers of regulation to  
a focus on rationalizing redundancies and assessing  
costs and benefits.
Against this backdrop, we are focusing our energy on 
earnings growth — in particular, growth from consistent 
investments in our franchise; growth by broadening our 
client and product footprint; and growth through new 
initiatives where we have not previously competed. 
Through it all, we assess opportunities through a 
framework that responds to a clear client need, leverages 
the firm’s core competencies including risk management 
and advice, and provides attractive, long-term 
shareholder returns.

per common share were $9.01 and ROE was 4.9 percent.

To that end, in September 2017, we laid out a $5 billion 
net revenue growth plan over the next three years.  
While the plan includes contributions from each of  
our businesses, this is not the limit of our ambitions. 
Importantly, these strategic initiatives are not dependent 
on any improvement in the current operating 
environment. That said, broader economic trends, 
market conditions and client conviction appear to be 
more favorable.
In this year’s letter to our shareholders, we provide  
an overview of the progress we are making on our 
strategic growth initiatives across our major businesses. 
Underpinning these initiatives are significant investments  
in engineering, which are critical to driving the expansion  
of our client franchise. Our history of commitment to 
investing in technology has created a competitive advantage 
and is at the center of our efforts to enhance the client 
experience and improve operating efficiency and scale. 
We conclude the letter with some thoughts on the  
year ahead.

Our Focus on Growth
Investment Banking
We continue to have the preeminent global franchise in 
investment banking. In 2017, the business generated its 
second-highest net revenues since the firm’s initial public 
offering in 1999, driven by the deep relationships that  
we have built with more than 8,000 clients over many 
decades. We ended the year ranked first in worldwide 
announced and completed mergers and acquisitions 
(M&A), and also ranked first in worldwide equity and 
equity-related offerings and common stock offerings.
To grow from here, we are increasing our coverage 
universe by approximately 1,000 companies, focusing  
on both private and public companies where we have 
significant room to build relationships. Of the new target 
clients, we have begun covering over 30 percent and 
expect to add the remainder in the next 12 to 18 months. 
To put this opportunity into perspective, our announced 
M&A volume market share on transaction sizes greater 
than $5 billion was approximately 50 percent in  
2017. However, we had just over 10 percent share  
on transaction sizes of less than $5 billion. These 
transactions tend to have fewer advisors and provide 
substantial financing opportunities.
We are also expanding our presence in North America, 
deploying more senior coverage bankers in major cities 
like Atlanta, Dallas, Seattle and Toronto. We see this as 
an important opportunity to deepen our client coverage 
in certain cities that are increasingly important hubs of 
corporate activity. As a result of all of our client coverage 
efforts, we have seen more than 75 new mandates across 
a variety of industry groups.
Another reason for our confidence in Investment 
Banking’s growth is the success we have had in debt 
underwriting. We identified debt underwriting as a 
strategic priority five years ago, and in 2017, we 
produced nearly $3 billion of net revenues — more  
than double our average from 2009 to 2011.
Lastly, China continues to represent a larger portion  
of the global economy. Today, more than 20 percent of 
the Fortune Global 500 companies are Chinese. In  
2017, we were ranked first in equity and equity-related 
offerings among international banks in the region,  
and we are confident our strong footprint positions us  
well to continue to capture opportunities created by  
China’s growth.
Institutional Client Services
Institutional Client Services includes some of our 
most dynamic businesses, and we manage the  
resources in these businesses in the context of the 
operating environment. This has been particularly true  
in Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Client  
Execution (FICC).
FICC. In the midst of industry-wide revenues falling by 
roughly 50 percent from their peak in 2009, we managed 
FICC resources down significantly. We took these actions 
because the opportunities in FICC had declined. This  
was certainly due to secular changes, but it also reflected 
cyclical dynamics as well.
Today the trajectory of the global economy appears to  
be moving towards a firmer footing. In this context, we 
don’t believe it is wise strategically to forgo the potential 
upside in this business moving forward. In fact, we have 
recently deployed more resources given the increasingly 
attractive opportunity set.
With respect to our execution and performance in 2017, 
our performance in FICC was weak in the context of our 
commitment to the business. In response, we undertook  
a comprehensive and detailed review to identify how we 
could improve. 
Our franchise has historically been very focused on  
active investor clients, structured trades and derivatives. 
As a consequence, we underinvested in cash products, 
which led to lower penetration with certain large asset 
managers and banks.
To address these issues, we are broadening our bank  
and asset manager client coverage and are focused on 
growing our corporate coverage. We have also diversified
Goldman Sachs 2017 Annual Report 
3 
 

--- Page 6 ---
our product footprint by enhancing our cash and flow 
trading capabilities. And we are holding our people 
accountable for delivering top three client rankings.
Our efforts are showing early signs of success, as we 
drive market share increases across our businesses.  
We are confident that these efforts will manifest 
themselves to all of our FICC clients over time.
A key differentiator supporting our overall growth  
will be employing our engineering capabilities to provide 
clients with best execution, content and analytics. For 
example, we have consolidated our automated pricing 
and risk management of electronic trading across 
Equities, Rates, Currencies and Commodities into a 
cohesive unit to drive efficiencies for our clients and  
the firm.
In summary, we are executing on our strategy in FICC  
to invest in areas where we see the greatest opportunity 
to meet client needs, grow market share and, if need  
be, reduce capital and expenses to size the business 
commensurate with client activity.
Equities. In Equities, we are making a multiyear 
investment in people, platforms and products to grow 
our leading franchise in both execution and financing.
In the last few years, we have made several strategic hires 
to enhance our electronic execution offering, including  
a new chief data officer for the firm, a global head of 
electronic execution services and a chief technology 
officer of electronic trading. In 2017, we added about 
100 people focused on electronic execution, including 
more than 70 engineers.
In terms of platforms, two years ago we acquired a 
high-performance trading platform from Pantor 
Engineering AB, which we have now rolled out to our 
European clients. Today, our smart router capabilities put 
us among the top three providers of the fastest, most 
comprehensive access to developed European markets.
At the end of 2017, we had an important validation of 
our electronic capabilities, announcing that we would 
become the exclusive execution provider for Bloomberg’s 
Tradebook. As a result, we are bringing on more than 
1,300 new clients from which we expect a revenue run 
rate of over $100 million.
4 
Goldman Sachs 2017 Annual Report
These and other investments support our initiative to 
serve quantitative-focused investors. This is an important 
and growing segment of the market, where we provide 
both execution and financing services. From these and 
other investments, we expect to increase our market 
share in electronic execution, which will benefit all  
of our Equities clients.
Investment Management
Our Investment Management business remains well 
positioned because of our breadth of asset classes, 
products and distribution. In 2017, we had $42 billion  
in long-term fee-based (LTFB) net inflows across the 
platform. We have had consistent growth with about 
$270 billion of LTFB net inflows over the last five years, 
including $52 billion from acquisitions.
In Goldman Sachs Asset Management, we continue to  
be a top provider to companies as they increasingly 
outsource the management of their pension plans and 
other assets. Currently, we have over $110 billion in 
assets where we act as a chief investment officer or 
advisor. In 2017, we made a strategic acquisition, further 
adding $20 billion of LTFB assets and contributing to 
our scale in this business.
The same outsourcing trend is happening within  
many insurance companies. We manage or advise on 
another $190 billion from insurance clients who leverage 
our enhanced analytics, custom asset allocation and risk 
management capabilities.
In Private Wealth Management, we saw strong  
long-term net inflows of $17 billion in 2017, up from 
$12 billion in 2016. Wealth creation is expanding at a 
rapid clip and given the strength of our offering and 
brand, we have not seen the limit to the growth of this 
segment of the market. We currently have over 700 
private wealth advisors and expect to grow our advisor 
population by approximately 30 percent through 2020.
In Ayco, we provide financial planning services to  
400 corporate clients and 13,000 executives across 
corporate America. However, we currently cover only  
 
 
 

--- Page 7 ---
20 percent of the Fortune 1000. At the end of 2017,  
we launched our digital advisory service designed for 
Ayco corporate client employees. This platform is live  
at more than 70 companies and we expect to roll this out  
to an additional 30 companies by the end of 2018.
Investing & Lending
Our Investing & Lending businesses provide promising 
companies and other clients with the capital they need  
to grow — either in the form of a loan or an equity 
investment. Our funded loan portfolio was $81 billion at 
the end of 2017, 3.5 times higher since the end of 2012.
In Private Wealth Management, we have increased our 
lending to our existing Private Wealth Management 
clients, growing our funded loans balance to about  
$24 billion in 2017 or a 15 percent increase year-over-
year. Lending net revenues from Private Wealth 
Management clients increased about 30 percent 
compared to 2016.
Through GS Select, we are working with third-party 
registered investment advisors to offer securities-based 
loans from Goldman Sachs Bank USA to their Private 
Wealth Management clients. This digital platform is just 
getting started, but we have already signed up some of 
the largest independent registered investment advisors in 
the U.S. who serve clients with nearly $4 trillion in assets.
Institutional Lending and Financing is also an  
important part of our growth strategy, an opportunity  
set driven by our special situations group, a differentiated 
financing and investing business. Here, dedicated teams 
of experienced underwriters partner primarily with 
middle-market companies to finance assets, improve  
their capital structure or deploy capital. This business is 
one of the highest margin and highest return businesses 
in the firm.
By growing our loan portfolio, we have increased our net 
revenue contribution from net interest income, which 
makes Investing & Lending net revenues more stable and 
recurring. We entered 2018 with a $2 billion net interest 
income run rate, before considering further loan growth. 
And net interest income in the fourth quarter was up 
roughly 70 percent year-over-year.
Another important investing business is our merchant 
banking business, which helps to start and grow 
companies. Merchant banking has been a source of 
strong risk-adjusted return opportunities and a core  
part of the firm’s DNA and mission. We’ve been in this 
business for over 30 years and it constitutes as powerful 
a franchise as any other in our firm.
Since the beginning of 2015, we generated nearly  
$11 billion of net revenues from our diversified portfolio 
of equity investments, with the largest contribution from 
merchant banking.
We continue to see attractive opportunities as an active 
investor, on behalf of both our clients and the firm,  
where our unique global franchise is an excellent 
sourcing mechanism. For example, in the past two years, 
we sourced over $40 billion in commitments to invest 
across our equity and credit merchant banking activities. 
In November 2017, we announced the Cooperation 
Fund, partnering with the China Investment Corporation. 
We intend to raise $5 billion to invest mainly in American 
manufacturing, industrial, consumer and healthcare 
companies, among others, that are developing business  
in China, or anticipate doing so in the future.
Marcus
Marcus: by Goldman Sachs (Marcus) is our digital 
consumer financial services platform. The foundation of 
this new business is rooted in addressing real consumer 
pain points by delivering value through products that are 
simple, transparent and flexible. Marcus launched with 
single no-fee personal loans and is evolving into a suite  
of products and services that we believe will move the 
needle for the firm over the coming years.
We are building Marcus at a point in time when 
consumers are moving away from brick-and-mortar 
branches to solutions that use technology to more 
seamlessly meet their needs. Goldman Sachs is uniquely 
positioned to be a disruptor in consumer finance —  
we can leverage our stable balance sheet, expertise in  
risk management and capabilities in technology without  
the burden of legacy distribution, technology and 
businesses that could constrain our ability to offer 
consumers better terms.
Goldman Sachs 2017 Annual Report

--- Page 8 ---
We originated $2.3 billion of personal loans from  
launch through the end of 2017. As we grow our 
portfolio, we remain very cognizant of the credit cycle. 
Our credit policy and pricing are designed to build a 
resilient loan book, and we remain deliberate in the 
pacing of our growth. We also continue to grow and 
diversify our sources of funding through our deposits 
business; Marcus deposits grew by more than $5 billion 
in 2017, ending the year at $17.1 billion — nearly double 
the balances we started with when we entered the 
business in April 2016. As of the end of 2017, Marcus 
was serving more than 350,000 customers across loans 
and deposits, with the clear potential to build 
relationships with millions of consumers.
While we recognize that it is early for us in the digital 
consumer finance space, there is a real need in the 
market, and the opportunities for further investment  
are compelling. We intend to extend our lending and 
savings products over time, both direct-to-consumer  
and through partnerships.
In addition, longer-term, we see opportunities to  
expand our suite of consumer offerings, and our criteria 
for evaluating new products will remain consistent: a 
large addressable market, the ability to leverage our 
expertise, the ability to deliver attractive shareholder 
returns, and importantly, the ability to deliver consumer-
centric solutions.
Our People
Our most important long-term competitive advantage 
remains our people. With that in mind, we invest  
heavily to attract, develop and promote extraordinary 
professionals who can serve our clients and drive  
our growth.
To that end, we are proud that we were once again 
recognized as one of Fortune magazine’s “100 Best 
Companies to Work For.” Goldman Sachs is one of  
only four companies to be recognized every year that  
the Great Place to Work Institute has issued its list since 
1984. We were also named as one of Working Mother’s 
“100 Best Companies,” which ranks companies with  
the best programs that support working parents, for  
the fifteenth consecutive year, earning us a place on the 
magazine’s “Hall of Fame” list.

Goldman Sachs 2017 Annual Report
In 2017, we hired more than 6,000 people around  
the world — recruiting each person one by one. Our 
application rates continue to rise and more than eight  
out of 10 people who were offered a role chose to join 
the firm. Our recruiting strategy is centered on expanding 
and diversifying our applicant pool. Through the use of 
technology, including video interviewing and hosting 
online coding challenges, we increased the number of 
schools from which we interview intern candidates  
by more than 150 schools for the 2018 class, compared 
to 2017.
What’s more, given the growing importance of 
technology to our businesses, we continue to focus  
on hiring individuals with backgrounds in science, 
technology, engineering and math (STEM). Today, 
approximately one-quarter of the firm works in various 
engineering-related roles. More than one-third of our 
2017 campus analyst hires majored in a STEM discipline, 
and that percentage will only continue to rise as we 
welcome our incoming 2018 class later this year.
In 2017, we selected our newest class of managing 
directors (MDs). Twenty-four percent of the 509 new 
MDs are women, while regionally, around 25 percent 
hail from Europe, the Middle East and Africa, 57 percent 
from the Americas and 18 percent from Asia. In addition, 
66 percent of the new class started at the firm as analysts 
or associates, a reflection of our commitment to talent 
development and retention over the long-term.
Succession and Our Leadership Bench
One of my most important responsibilities as chairman 
and chief executive officer is to work with our Board  
of Directors on ensuring smooth and effective leadership 
transitions. Our firm is fortunate to have a deep pool  
of talent at all levels, and regardless of when the  
next transition is to take effect, we are well prepared. 
With Harvey Schwartz’s announced retirement as 
president and co-chief operating officer (COO) of the 
firm, David Solomon will assume sole responsibility  
for these roles. I look forward to working with David  
to continue to build our global franchise and pursue 
long-term value for our shareholders.
 
 

--- Page 9 ---
Over his 20-year career, Harvey has held leadership  
roles across a broad range of the firm’s operations — 
from Securities and Investment Banking, to serving as 
chief financial officer (CFO) and, most recently, as 
president and co-COO. As the global co-head of  
the Securities Division, Harvey was instrumental in 
overseeing growth in our client franchise across FICC 
and Equities. During the financial crisis, Harvey played 
an important role in the management of our risk 
exposures, even while we were meeting the significant 
needs of our clients. During Harvey’s tenure as CFO,  
he played a critical role in helping the firm adapt  
to significant changes in the regulatory environment.  
Harvey has consistently demonstrated his deep 
commitment to the firm and its values. His work ethic, 
command of complexity and client focus have defined  
his career, while his influence on many leaders at the  
firm has made an indelible impact on generations  
of professionals at Goldman Sachs. We thank Harvey  
for his exceptional service and wish him all the best  
in the years ahead.
Our Impact
Goldman Sachs has long embraced our responsibility to 
help address crucial environmental, social and economic 
challenges around the world, both through our core 
businesses and by engaging in activities that leverage our 
expertise to promote economic progress. As part of that 
mission, we seek to be active and long-term corporate 
citizens in the communities in which we operate. Given 
our position at the crossroads of the capital markets,  
our mission is to drive positive change in our work with 
clients by helping them to grow their businesses, be on  
a stronger financial footing, provide access to key services 
and contribute to economic growth.
In some cases, that means helping entrepreneurs succeed 
through programs such as 10,000 Women and 10,000 
Small Businesses. In other cases, we are financing projects 
that can improve living standards within traditionally 
underserved communities. Our goal is to conduct 
philanthropy with a purpose — making meaningful 
contributions where our skills and leadership can make  
a clear difference.
10,000 Small Businesses Summit
As a natural next step in our focus on small businesses, 
we hosted in February 2018 the 10,000 Small Businesses 
Summit: The Big Power of Small Business, which was  
the largest-ever gathering of small business owners in  
the U.S. Taking place in Washington, D.C., the summit 
convened more than 2,000 small business owners from  
a diverse range of industries and geographies with a 
select group of business leaders, industry experts and 
policymakers to discuss the vital role that small 
businesses play in the U.S. economy.
From sharing strategies and tactics for hiring, obtaining 
capital and optimizing growth, to discussing policy-
related topics such as regulation and global competition, 
this unique event provided an opportunity for the alumni 
of 10,000 Small Businesses to come together and share 
ideas, discuss common challenges and elevate their 
collective voice. The following day, participants took that 
voice to Capitol Hill, where they met with representatives 
from their respective districts and states to advocate for 
policies that support the continued ability of small 
businesses to grow, thrive and compete.
Goldman Sachs Gives
Goldman Sachs Gives is a donor-advised fund through 
which participating managing directors of the firm can 
recommend grants to qualified nonprofit organizations 
around the world. Since its launch in 2010, the fund has 
made more than $1.3 billion in grants through the end of 
2017 to 6,000 organizations that further Goldman Sachs 
Gives’ mission of fostering innovative ideas, solving 
economic and social issues, and enabling progress in 
underserved communities worldwide.
As an example of our firm’s commitment to citizenship 
and community engagement, Goldman Sachs Gives 
continued to expand its reach in 2017, through initiatives 
such as the second annual Analyst Impact Fund, a 
competition whereby teams of analysts from the firm vied 
to win a Goldman Sachs Gives grant to the nonprofit  
of their choice. Demonstrating the teamwork, analytics 
and excellence that are core to the values and culture  
of Goldman Sachs, the analysts who participated 
represented a broad range of Goldman Sachs offices and 
divisions. The three winning teams supported nonprofit

Looking Ahead
Today, conditions are highly supportive of a growing 
economy and interest rates are relatively low for where 
we are in the growth cycle. But as managers of risk,  
we do our best to prepare our clients and the firm for 
low-probability, yet highly consequential events. With  
the U.S. near full employment, inflation still relatively 
low and the end of quantitative easing, there is a greater 
chance that excesses can build up. In this vein, we 
continue to be mindful of what can go wrong, keeping  
a close eye on risk, particularly in the context of the 
credit cycle.
Cycles come and go, and, as we have seen in recent 
months, markets can change course at a moment’s notice, 
and often in response to factors no one can predict with 
any certainty.
Still, we remain optimistic and confident in our ability to 
grow. Our client franchise is strong and we are executing 
on our growth initiatives, including making investments 
across our businesses to expand our franchise and to 
grow earnings across the firm.
The hard work, commitment and collaboration of our 
people will remain cornerstones of our long-term success. 
In the process, we are confident that we can continue to 
generate strong relative returns and value for our 
shareholders.

organizations that focus on delivering online educational 
resources for female refugees, bail reform initiatives and 
the education of girls in rural India.
Additionally, in the wake of the destruction caused by 
Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, as well as the 
earthquakes in Mexico, the firm and Goldman Sachs 
Gives made grants exceeding $2 million to organizations 
providing immediate resources, short-term relief, long-
term housing and small business reconstruction and 
recovery. Equally important, more than 1,000 volunteers 
across the firm donated their time to help in the 
immediate and ongoing recovery efforts.
Urban Investment Group
Through our Urban Investment Group (UIG), we have 
realized the potential for investments in underserved 
urban areas. We work with local leaders and nonprofits, 
focusing on community development and financing for 
socially motivated enterprises and small businesses. 
While the investment strategy has evolved over the  
years, the mission remains the same: to make an impact 
in underserved areas while making a good return.
Since its inception in 2001 through the end of  
2017, UIG has committed more than $6 billion to 
underserved U.S. communities, facilitating the creation 
and preservation of more than 25,000 housing units — 
the majority of which are affordable for low- to 
middle-income families — as well as more than 2 million 
square feet of community space and over 7.5 million 
square feet of commercial, retail and industrial facilities.
As an example, Goldman Sachs committed nearly  
$500 million to the Essex Crossing development on  
the Lower East Side of Manhattan. The project, at  
1.9 million square feet, is one of the largest developments 
in New York City and is reactivating a site that had sat 
vacant for almost 50 years. Essex Crossing, which was 
designed with the local community, will include just over 
1,000 apartments, more than half of which are reserved 
for low- and middle-income tenants, and 900,000 square 
feet of commercial and community space. Such projects 
have the potential to usher in a new model for urban 
investment, focusing on infrastructure, jobs and resources 
that benefit the public at large.

DEAR NVIDIANS 
AND STAKEHOLDERS,
As we prepare this annual report, the world 
is in an all-out war against COVID-19. Unlike 
anything we’ve confronted in generations, 
the COVID-19 pandemic is a medical as well 
as an economic crisis. Citizens all over the 
world are sheltered in place. Store shelves 
are empty. Restaurants are closed. Streets 
are eerily quiet. And while we battle this 
virus by staying at home, brave nurses, 
doctors, and first responders are on the 
front lines risking their safety and that of 
their families to protect us. Their courage is 
breathtaking, and we owe them our thanks 
and support.
At NVIDIA, we exercised an abundance of 
caution and closed our nearly 60 offices 
around the world. Employees are working 
from home to help reduce the spread of the 
virus. Our extended family of direct hourly 
contractors is also sheltered in place and 
will continue to be paid.
We are deploying our most powerful 
weapons to defeat COVID-19: our 
technology and our scientists. NVIDIA-
powered supercomputers all over the world 
are being called into service to search for 
new drug compounds that can treat or 
vaccinate against the virus. NVIDIA’s team of 
computational scientists is joining these 
researchers to speed their discovery. We’re 
giving COVID-19 researchers free access to 
our Parabricks genome-sequencing 
software. So far, 325 institutions, including 
hospitals, universities, and supercomputing 
centers, have engaged. Meanwhile, we 
united gamers around the world to share the 
GPUs in their gaming rigs, assembling the 
largest distributed supercomputer ever to 
run Folding@Home.
Several hundred thousand gamers amassed 
a 1.5 exaflops supercomputer. That is 
1,500,000,000,000,000,000 operations per 
second! Five times the compute power of 
Summit, the most powerful supercomputer 
in the world, and more than the world’s top 
100 supercomputers combined. 
No war has ever united the world’s 
scientists like this pandemic. We will get 
through this together.
Rising to the Challenge
As we entered the year, our outstanding 
growth was stopped in its tracks by the 
simultaneous headwinds of a collapsing 
cryptocurrency market, a pause in 
hyperscale spending, and a rapidly 
deteriorating trade environment with China. 
Despite being knocked back on our heels at 
the outset, we finished the year strong.
Full-year revenue was $10.9 billion, down 
7 percent. Gross margins expanded to 62 
percent and GAAP earnings per share were 
$4.52, down 32 percent. We returned $390 
million during the year to shareholders 
through quarterly cash dividends. The 
growth trajectory of the fourth quarter tells 
the story—with revenue of $3.11 billion, up 
41 percent from a year ago.
GPU revenue, which consists of GeForce 
gaming, Quadro workstation graphics, and 
Data Center platforms for HPC and AI, was 
$2.77 billion during the quarter, up 40 
percent from a year ago. Data Center 
revenue was a record $968 million, up 43 
percent from a year ago. Tegra system-on-
chip processor revenue, which includes 
automotive, custom gaming systems, and 
embedded edge AI platforms, was $331 
million, up 47 percent from a year ago.
Graphics. Accelerated Computing. AI. 
Data Centers. Self-Driving Cars.
We are innovating at the epicenter of the 
most important technology trends of our 
time. We made significant advances in each 
area last year. Believing in the importance of 
this work and staying focused despite the 
setback drove our return to growth. Let me 
say a few words about each area.
THE GROWTH TRAJECTORY OF THE FOURTH QUARTER TELLS THE STORY

NVIDIA Omniverse for architecture, engineering, and construction
Reinventing Graphics
Graphics is the force that fuels NVIDIA’s 
massive R&D engine. NVIDIA invented 
the GPU and introduced the world to 
programmable shading nearly 20 years 
ago. Since then, we have dreamed about 
creating the next big thing: real-time ray 
tracing, which simulates the behavior of 
light more accurately to create 
photorealistic images.
After more than a decade’s work, 
we created the world’s first real-time 
ray-tracing GPU. It combines two new 
groundbreaking technologies: a ray-tracing 
accelerator and a deep learning Tensor 
Core processor. 
The ray-tracing accelerator finds the 
intersections of billions of light rays and 
the objects they illuminate. As a complex 
shader program computes the surface 
illumination by the beam, some of the 
light is absorbed, reflected, or refracted 
onto other nearby surfaces. This ray- 
tracing process iterates to produce a 
photorealistic image.
Even with the most powerful GPUs, the 
computation is too immense to render the 
images fast enough, let alone beautifully. AI 
came to the rescue. Using state-of-the-art 
deep learning methods, we taught an AI to 
predict the rest of the image from the few 
rendered pixels. The AI model runs on 
super-fast Tensor Core processors. 
Combining programmable shading, ray 
tracing, and artificial intelligence, we have 
reinvented computer graphics. We call this 
new graphics architecture NVIDIA RTX.
NVIDIA RTX: Biggest Upgrade in the History 
of the GPU
The graphics industry—including game 
developers, design tool makers, and film 
studios—has overwhelmingly adopted 
NVIDIA RTX. Leaders like Pixar, ILM, Sony, 
Weta Digital, Epic, Adobe, Autodesk, 
Dassault, EA, Activision Blizzard, 
Microsoft, Ubisoft, and many more have 
added accelerated ray tracing. NVIDIA RTX 
is a home run. We have created the best 
reason to upgrade graphics since the 
invention of the GPU. 
We have the best lineup of GeForce 
desktop PC gaming GPUs in our history. 
The upgrade cycle is well on its way. We 
estimate that by the end of January some 15 
percent of our installed base had upgraded 
to RTX. We expect this to be one of the most 
successful GeForce generations.
We also expanded the GeForce market 
this year in three significant ways: RTX 
Max-Q gaming laptops, RTX Studio 
creative workstations, and GeForce NOW 
cloud gaming.
With Max-Q, we’ve created a new gaming 
device category: thin and light gaming PCs. 
Gamers want a powerful GPU, but in an 
elegant laptop design. GeForce RTX with 
Max-Q technology has broken through the 
energy-efficiency barrier needed to address 
the large pent-up demand for gaming 
laptops. There are more than 125 models of 
Turing architecture-powered laptops 
shipping today.
NVIDIA RTX is democratizing film-quality 
rendering for all creators and designers. 
Photorealistic rendering is no longer solely 
the realm of professional studios with large 
server farms. Forty creative and design 
applications are now RTX-accelerated, 
including Dimension, Substance Alchemist, 
and Premiere Pro from Adobe, as well as 
Chaos Group’s V-Ray, Autodesk’s Arnold, 
and Blender’s Cycles.
And in partnership with leading PC makers 
Dell, HP, and Lenovo, we built a whole new 
line of NVIDIA RTX-powered consumer and 
professional workstations and laptops to 
run these new design and creative tools. 
More than 60 models of RTX Studio laptops 
are now available.
GeForce NOW, our cloud gaming service, 
is out of beta. Hundreds of millions more 
gamers can now add a virtual GeForce 
graphics card to their device. GeForce 
NOW’s reach is global via NVIDIA’s data 
centers in North America and Europe, and 
through partners like Taiwan Mobile, 
Russia’s Rostelcom, Korea’s LG U+, and 
Japan’s SoftBank. More than 2 million 
gamers joined GeForce NOW in the 
platform’s first week.

NVIDIA Pioneered 
Accelerated Computing
We pioneered the use of GPUs to accelerate 
scientific computing. As semiconductor 
scaling reaches its limits, GPU acceleration 
has proven to be an excellent path forward. 
The November 2019 TOP500 list of the 
world’s fastest supercomputers was 
NVIDIA’s best showing to date. Now 136 
systems on the TOP500 are NVIDIA-
accelerated, including Summit, the world’s 
most powerful supercomputer. The most 
powerful systems in the United States, 
Europe, and Japan, and the world’s top 
industrial supercomputer, are all powered 
by NVIDIA GPUs. From just 10 percent four 
years ago, NVIDIA GPUs now power 40 
percent of this year’s new supercomputers. 
We expect this trend to continue.
Unlike running code on CPUs, accelerated 
computing is a full-stack approach—
optimized across processor, system, 
software, algorithms, and application for 
incredible speedups. With each application 
domain—whether ray tracing, molecular 
dynamics, fluid dynamics, quantum 
chemistry, or deep learning—processing 
time has gone from weeks to days, and from 
days to hours. Researchers see a boost in 
productivity. Data center operators enjoy 
cost reductions. This creates new growth 
opportunities for our company.
This year we achieved significant 
milestones in several new 
application domains:
 > NVIDIA RTX for photorealistic 
rendering for design and film
 > NVIDIA Aerial for 5G 
radio processing 
 > NVIDIA Parabricks for next-
generation genome sequencing 
 > NVIDIA RAPIDS for data science 
and analytics
 > NVIDIA TensorRT for deep 
learning inferencing

NVIDIA AI
NVIDIA AI for Inference
AI is the most powerful technology force of 
our time and the engine driving our data 
center business. AI is software that learns to 
automate skills that require intelligence: the 
ability to perceive, reason, and plan. 
Someday, trillions of connected devices 
will perceive their environment, infer a 
response, and do seemingly smart things. 
We will simply tell these devices what we 
need. Recent breakthroughs are making this 
future possible sooner rather than later. 
Researchers have made advances in speech 
recognition, natural language 
understanding, recommendation systems, 
and natural speech synthesis—the essential 
elements to have a conversation with an AI. 
Billions of people each make hundreds of 
queries every day. The AI models, each 
processing billions of operations, must 
respond in a fraction of a second. 
Inference is an enormous computing 
challenge—done at hyperscale and 
processing complex algorithms at light 
speed. NVIDIA excels at this work. Inference 
is a big opportunity for us.
Inference is the fastest-growing part of our 
data center business, which itself is our 
fastest-growing segment. After years of 
development, we announced NVIDIA 
TensorRT 7, which can compile and optimize 
image, speech, and language models. 
Developers can now train AI models on 
NVIDIA GPUs, and then optimize them for 
deployment on NVIDIA GPUs. Develop on 
NVIDIA—run on NVIDIA. 
AI software learns by processing massive 
amounts of previously collected data to find 
a complex hierarchy of patterns that can 
predict what to do when a similar situation 
arises. AI can learn new skills through 
examples, trial and error, or adapting skills 
from similar tasks. AI computers must be 
incredibly fast to learn from a large amount 
of data and perform more complex skills. 
Building fast computers is where NVIDIA 
comes in.
NVIDIA builds the computing platform for 
the era of AI. We made a giant bet, 
reimagined the computing stack, and 
invented a whole new kind of computer. It 
combines our new GPU with Tensor Core 
processing, NVLink high-speed 
interconnects, cuDNN libraries for deep 
learning, Magnum IO for distributed 
computing and high-speed data movement, 
HGX multi-GPU server boards, NVIDIA DGX 
computer systems, the NGC registry of 
pre-optimized acceleration libraries, the 
TensorRT neural network graph compiler, 
and the Triton Inference Server to deploy 
models into hyperscale data centers. We 
have invested tens of thousands of 
engineering years to advance AI computing.
NVIDIA’s AI architecture is ideal for training 
as well as inference and is available 
anywhere from the cloud to PCs. It scales 
from a tiny two-watt NVIDIA Jetson 
computer to the fastest supercomputer in 
the world. The performance, versatility, 
broad accessibility, and consistent pace of 
advance are the pillars of our success.

NVIDIA AI at the Edge
Mellanox
AI started in the cloud. The next big 
opportunity will be at the edge, where the 
action is. IoT sensors connected to AI 
computers will automate retail stores, 
warehouses, factories, farms, streets, 
highways, airports, and subways. AI can 
orchestrate traffic, adjust and save power, 
speed checkouts, or direct a fleet of forklifts 
in a warehouse. Processing AI at the edge is 
needed to limit the cost of streaming 
continuous sensor data, protect sensitive 
information, or respond instantly to 
the environment.
During the year we announced the NVIDIA 
EGX Intelligent Edge Computing Platform. A 
full-stack AI platform, EGX is highly secure, 
is high throughput, runs cloud-native 
applications, and can be deployed and 
managed as a distributed fleet. With EGX, 
we are bringing AI to the world’s largest 
industries. Walmart, BMW, NTT East, 
Procter & Gamble, and Samsung Electronics 
are among the first adopters of EGX.
5G is going to turbocharge edge AI. Running 
on the same EGX platform, and with the 
NVIDIA Aerial 5G GPU-accelerated software 
radio, telecommunications service providers 
can provision 5G services on any standard 
OEM server. And companies can provide 
highly reliable and secure AI services in 
places where Wi-Fi is not available. Ericsson 
is NVIDIA’s development partner to build an 
industrial-strength solution for 5G.
Data center technologies are central to our 
computing platform. In 2019, we announced 
the purchase of Mellanox Technologies, the 
world’s leading provider of networking 
technologies for high-performance data 
centers. Our companies are long-term 
partners, having built together many of the 
world’s supercomputers and NVIDIA AI 
systems. Mellanox has fantastic people and 
culture, and a long history of innovation. 
Based in Israel, it will be one of our most 
significant design centers. We have received 
approval from all necessary regulatory 
agencies to proceed with the acquisition, and 
expect it to close on or about April 27, 2020.
NVIDIA AI in Autonomous Vehicles 
and Robotics
Every machine that moves will have 
autonomous capability someday, from 
vehicles and construction equipment to 
forklifts and wheelchairs.
We created the NVIDIA DRIVE AV platform to 
enable any company to build autonomous 
cars. DRIVE is an open platform that 
includes an end-to-end AV development 
infrastructure, functional safety, an 
auto-grade AV computer, and a self-driving 
car application. Our platform is used 
worldwide by hundreds of established 
companies and startups building 
autonomous cars, shuttles, taxis, trucks, 
and delivery and logistics robots.
During the year, we announced our first 
truck partnership with Volvo Group, one of 
the world’s largest truck and construction 
vehicle makers. Volvo is using the DRIVE 
platform end-to-end—from data center 
servers to develop, validate, and simulate 
their self-driving truck application to 
deploying a fleet of trucks powered by 
DRIVE computers. 
We also announced Orin, our second-
generation robotics processor. Orin’s 
combination of CPU, GPU, Tensor Core, and 
computer vision processing offers 10x the 
performance of our current Xavier SoC. 
Future self-driving vehicles will demand 
expanded driving capabilities, improved 
safety through software and hardware 
redundancy, and faster response times. 
Orin’s leap in performance and safety 
architecture will make it possible. 
Autonomous vehicles represent just one of 
the opportunities. In the future, warehouses 
and manufacturing lines will have fleets of 
Orin-powered robots that work closely and 
collaboratively with people to move, lift, and 
make things.

--- Page 11 ---
NVIDIA will have deep domain expertise 
in important markets—transportation, 
healthcare, manufacturing, logistics, and 
public safety—and offer an end-to-end AI 
platform that makes it easy for companies 
to develop their own AI services. 
And we will continue to advance the state 
of computer graphics for gaming, art, and 
design while leveraging our expertise and 
scale to create the future of AI.
That’s our plan: Graphics, Accelerated 
Computing, and AI. From Data Centers 
to Self-Driving Cars. Graphics feeds AI. 
AI feeds Graphics.
We had an extraordinary year. Confronted 
with adversity as we entered the year, the 
company rose to the challenge and made it 
our finest moment. I am incredibly proud of 
our people and the work we did. 
And now, as the world faces one of the great 
tests of our generation, I know that NVIDIA 
will step up again. We are inspired and driven 
to create the essential instruments for 
scientists, researchers, and developers 
whose work can change the world. It’s our 
purpose, and it is as relevant today as it’s 
ever been.
Thank you all for your support. The best, and 
most amazing, is yet to come. Stay tuned.

CARING FOR 
OUR COMMUNITIES
LOOKING AHEAD  
NVIDIA has a singular goal that remains our 
mission today: to build one of the world’s 
great companies—one that makes lasting 
impacts on industry and society, lifting 
humanity higher, while achieving near-term 
business goals for long-term sustainability. 
We do this with our inventions and ideas as 
well as through our company-wide 
contributions to our communities. 
We are living through an extraordinary time 
in computing. Though computers have 
steadily become more useful, broader 
adoption has been limited by skilled 
programmers who are also domain experts 
in niche markets. Unless an application has 
a sufficiently large market—like search or 
photo editing—it is unlikely to warrant 
an investment. 
One of many examples of our inventions 
contributing to society is NVIDIA Clara, a 
platform that is advancing the science and 
practice of healthcare. Clara AI helps 
radiologists develop AI models to detect 
early signs of disease. 
This year we introduced Clara AI 
federated learning, a way to enable multi-
organizational AI research collaboration 
while preserving patient privacy. We are 
delighted that the American College of 
Radiology and UCLA Health are early 
adopters. Clara Genomics is an acceleration 
platform to analyze the data from gene 
sequencing. The speedups it provides will 
significantly accelerate biological and 
medical research and discovery. 
We encourage and make it easy for our 
employees to support charities that most 
inspire them. Our Inspire 365 initiative offers 
employees a large variety of volunteer 
opportunities and time off from work to help 
their communities. NVIDIA offices around 
the world held nearly 200 charitable events 
last year and contributed nearly 12,000 
volunteer hours and millions of dollars.
Now, AI can adapt a previously learned 
skill and program itself for a niche 
application. A farmer can teach an AI to pick 
and sort a harvest of tomatoes into different 
categories to sell to restaurants, in grocery 
stores, or to be used for sauce. A radiologist 
can teach an AI to detect a rare disease. A 
maker of air conditioners can train an AI to 
monitor its installed base to ensure 
energy-efficient operations. 
AI is democratizing software. Any company 
can become a technology company. Domain 
experts will not need to program. They will 
teach AI to automate repetitive or dangerous 
tasks. AI will enable automation across the 
world’s largest industries and drive a new 
wave of computing adoption.
NVIDIA will contribute by building the AI 
computer—for researchers, for inference 
deployment in the cloud, for AI computing at 
the edge, and for autonomous machines. 
NVIDIA’s platform will be optimized across 
full stacks—from chips, systems, software, 
and algorithms, to data center networking—
available anywhere, from every cloud 
service provider and computer maker.

Strategic report
Group Chairman’s statement
The progress we made in 2021 means that HSBC is well 
placed to open up a world of opportunity for our customers 
as economic recovery continues.
investors all continued along their ESG 
journeys in 2021, as public awareness  
grew and activism around climate change  
in particular increased. HSBC has long 
understood that good ESG performance goes 
hand-in-hand with good financial performance, 
and it is now abundantly clear that the action 
businesses take on sustainability is an 
important lens through which they are being 
viewed and assessed by their stakeholders.
Progress
HSBC delivered a good financial performance 
in 2021. Reported profit before tax was 
$18.9bn, an increase of $10.1bn as compared 
with 2020, while adjusted profit before tax was 
$21.9bn, up 79%. All of our regions were 
profitable in 2021, supported by the global 
economic recovery, demonstrating the value 
of our global network. There was also good 
growth in focus areas such as Asia wealth 
and trade. In line with the dividend policy 
announced in February 2021, the Board 
approved a second interim dividend for 2021 
of $0.18, meaning the full year dividends for 
2021 are $0.25.
Good progress has been made in executing 
our strategic plan. A number of key milestones 
were reached in 2021 – including resolving the 
future of our retail businesses in France and 
the US, the organic build-out of HSBC 
Personal Wealth Planning in mainland China, 
and acquisitions in Singapore and India to 
accelerate the development of our wealth 
capabilities across Asia. At the same time, our 
work to digitise HSBC and to play a leading 
role in the net zero transition has continued  
at pace. There is more to do – and it will be 
important to see successive consecutive 
quarters of growth – but good momentum 
exists across our businesses. 
Board of Directors
Due to ongoing travel restrictions and safety 
concerns, the Board has not been able to meet 
in person for two years. We look forward to 
reconnecting with each other and welcoming 
those Board members we are yet to meet in 
person. At the same time, we have come to 
appreciate the benefits of this new way of 
working – which include more regular 
dialogue, less travel and reduced costs – 
and we will therefore use a hybrid model 
going forward. 
Mark E Tucker
Group Chairman
2021 was another challenging year. 
While Covid-19 vaccines were rolled 
out globally, some countries dealt with 
very significant outbreaks and many 
more operated under various restrictions 
at different points. As in 2020, this took 
a huge toll on our customers, our 
people, the communities we serve 
and our shareholders. 
My colleagues once again demonstrated their 
resilience, their professionalism and, above all, 
their exceptional commitment to serving our 
customers. Our purpose as an organisation is 
to open up a world of opportunity. Our people 
have brought this to life in the way they have 
supported our customers and each other. On 
behalf of the Board, I would like to thank them 
warmly for everything they have done, and 
continue to do.
ESG was another major theme of 2021. The 
pandemic has exposed the fragility of the 
planet and society as a whole. It has also 
created a catalyst for change and highlighted 
the associated commercial opportunities.

with good financial performance.”
and value. For our suppliers, it can mean 
supporting them to grow their businesses 
and strengthen their own supply chains.  
And for the communities we serve, it can 
mean being a responsible citizen and leading 
the net zero transition.
Stakeholder engagement has been a priority 
for the Board in 2021. For example, the Board 
oversaw HSBC’s continuing work in support  
of our ambition to align our financed emissions 
to net zero by 2050 or sooner. This included 
engaging shareholders and leading NGOs 
ahead of the 2021 AGM, when our special 
resolution on the next steps in relation to  
our climate ambition was overwhelmingly 
approved. We also reviewed and approved 
a new thermal coal phase-out policy, which 
we announced in December 2021 and is 
designed to allow HSBC to help facilitate the 
transition to net zero in both developed and 
developing markets. 
Thank you
Finally, I would like to reiterate how grateful 
I am to all my colleagues for the great 
dedication and care they have shown to our 
customers and to each other over the past 
year. Their tremendous efforts have, above 
everything else, made us what we are today 
– and will shape what we become tomorrow.
Mark E Tucker
Group Chairman
22 February 2022
We were pleased to hold our first hybrid  
AGM in May 2021, which the majority of 
shareholders attended virtually. It is a matter 
of deep regret to me, and to the Board as a 
whole, that we have been unable to meet our 
loyal Hong Kong shareholders face-to-face. 
We look forward to doing so again as soon 
as it is practicable and safe. In the meantime, 
a hybrid meeting does at least allow for 
constructive engagement and discussions 
with shareholders, which we continue to 
value highly.
At the 2021 AGM, Laura Cha, Henri de 
Castries and Heidi Miller all retired from the 
Board. We also recently announced that Irene 
Lee and Pauline van der Meer Mohr will step 
down from the Board at the conclusion of our 
2022 AGM in April. I am enormously grateful  
to them all for their important and valuable 
contributions to the Board, the committees 
and the subsidiary entities on which they have 
served. We welcomed Dame Carolyn Fairbairn 
and Rachel Duan to the Board on 1 September. 
Both Carolyn and Rachel bring a wealth of 
skills and expertise that will be of great value 
to the Board’s discussions.
External environment 
The roll-out of vaccines around the world and 
a robust global economic recovery mean we 
entered 2022 in a better state than we might 
have expected a year ago. There are clearly 
still significant challenges ahead, foremost 
among which is the uncertainty caused by the 
spread of the Omicron variant, and potentially 
other variants in the future. Supply chain 
bottlenecks, high energy and food prices, 
surging consumer demand and higher wages 
have combined to drive up inflation. Central 
banks have already begun to respond by 
tightening monetary policy and this is likely 
to continue in 2022.
Global economic growth forecasts are fairly 
resilient – our own forecast is 4.1% global  
GDP growth in 2022. However, there remains 
a great deal of uncertainty given the wide 
range of responses from governments to  
the different challenges they face. 
After China’s strong recovery, growth slowed 
in the second half of 2021. As a result, we 
expect China’s government to take action to 
ease monetary and fiscal policies, with the  
aim of shoring up growth. Meanwhile, India’s 
economy is set to grow rapidly, but growth is 
expected to be slower in the UK and the US. 
Global trade performed well in 2021, with 
volumes rising above pre-pandemic levels 
despite ongoing supply chain disruptions. 
Looking forward, trade growth could be 
further boosted by the lifting of restrictions 
on movement that remain in place in some 
countries. There are also signs that supply 
chain bottlenecks will ease as the year  
goes on, although when and how remains 
uncertain. The Regional Comprehensive 
Economic Partnership is expected to 
reinforce Asia’s central role in global trade. 
Along with the bilateral trade deals being 
struck by some countries, it also shows that 
trade liberalisation continues to advance in 
some parts of the world.
Although there is currently no long-term 
agreement between the UK and the EU on 
access to financial services, we have worked 
for a number of years to ensure we will be able 
to maintain a full service for our clients under 
all potential scenarios. Ideally, the temporary 
arrangements on access to financial services 
will be retained so as to minimise disruption 
and enable the UK financial services industry 
to continue to offer the many benefits  
it brings to the UK and EU economies. 
However, we are well prepared for a broad 
range of outcomes.
As a global bank operating in more than 
60 countries and territories, with a history 
stretching back more than 156 years, we 
always have experienced – and always will 
experience – geopolitical tensions. However, 
we remain alive to the potential impact that 
geopolitics can have on our business, as well 
as on our clients. The relationship between the 
US and China remains a prominent feature of 
the external environment, but we do not 
currently expect it to change significantly in 
the near future. We also expect the mutual 
economic benefits brought by the UK-China 
relationship to outweigh any short-term 
pressures. We continue to engage with all 
governments and remain focused on serving 
the needs of our customers in both East and 
West, and the many points in between.
Stakeholder engagement
Our purpose of opening up a world of 
opportunity is equally applicable to our 
different stakeholders. For our people, it  
can mean helping them to develop new skills 
and advance in their careers, as well as being 
diverse and inclusive. For our shareholders, 
it can mean creating sustainable returns

Strategic report 
Group Chief Executive’s review
We are making good progress transforming and growing 
HSBC, which is helping us to open up a world of opportunity 
for our customers, our colleagues and our shareholders.
As we do so, we will be guided by the  
values underpinning our purpose – we value 
difference, we succeed together, we take 
responsibility and we get it done. These are 
the behaviours that will help us to identify and 
unlock new opportunities – and together they 
represent the kind of organisation we want 
HSBC to be.
With our purpose and values firmly in mind, 
we made good progress in 2021 against all 
four of our strategic pillars: focus on our 
strengths, digitise at scale, energise for growth 
and transition to net zero. Delivering against 
them contributed to a strong financial 
performance, which was supported  
by the global economic recovery. All of our 
regions were profitable and we have built  
a strong platform for future growth.
For some of our customers, the first priority 
has remained navigating the ongoing impact 
of Covid-19, particularly in markets that 
suffered severe outbreaks or faced restrictions 
during the course of 2021. To this end, I must 
again offer my deep thanks to my colleagues, 
who have exemplified our values in supporting 
our customers and each other, all the while 
continuing to deal with the pandemic 
themselves.
As economies recovered and opened up, we 
have helped more and more of our customers 
to look beyond the immediate horizon and 
towards the opportunities we can open up  
for them. In 2021, we helped almost 269,000 
personal customers to buy their first homes. 
We lent $47bn to help our business banking 
customers to run, grow and digitise their 
businesses. We launched new products and 
services that make it easier for our customers 
to bank with us, and allow us to focus our 
efforts on serving them. We facilitated $799bn 
of trade, which has helped businesses and 
economies around the world to recover and 
grow again.
As our people also began to look to the future, 
we created opportunities for them too. We 
helped more than 30,000 colleagues move 
into new roles in 2021, and over 115,000 
colleagues to develop future-ready skills 
through our learning programmes. An 
increasing number of these programmes 
focused on building skills and capabilities  
in areas like data and sustainability, which  
are essential to our future.
Noel Quinn
Group Chief Executive 
A year ago, we refreshed our core 
purpose as an organisation. ‘Opening up 
a world of opportunity’ was the outcome 
of extensive consultation with colleagues 
and customers around the globe. I have 
been delighted by the way it has been 
embraced across HSBC – and in the 
many conversations I have had with 
colleagues, I have been greatly 
encouraged by how they see their 
roles contributing towards it. 
Opening up a world of opportunity draws 
heavily on HSBC’s past, but it also 
encapsulates what we need to focus on to 
succeed now and in the future. Opportunities 
have always come in many shapes and forms, 
some of which have required us to change 
and evolve to make the most of them. We 
need to keep challenging ourselves to find and 
capture these opportunities. This is how we 
will help our customers to grow and succeed 
over the long term.

Group Chief Executive’s review
” The opportunities of the 
future will be defined by  
the single greatest challenge  
of our time – the need for 
everyone to make the  
low-carbon transition.”
More than anything else, the opportunities 
of the future will be defined by the single 
greatest challenge of our time – the need for 
everyone to make the low-carbon transition. 
To seize them, we must change, adapt, 
invest and innovate. Since 2019, we have 
reduced greenhouse gas emissions across 
our operations by more than half. We also 
provided and facilitated $82.6bn of 
sustainable finance and investment – 
bringing the cumulative total since 1 January 
2020 to $126.7bn, towards our ambition of 
$750bn to $1tn by 2030. Furthermore, we 
have collaborated with other banks and 
financial institutions to help accelerate the 
transition through initiatives including the 
Net-Zero Banking Alliance, the Glasgow 
Financial Alliance for Net Zero and the 
Sustainable Markets Initiative’s Financial 
Services Taskforce.
Financial performance
The global economic recovery supported our 
2021 financial performance, as the release of 
expected credit losses resulted in an 
improvement in the profitability of the Group 
and all global businesses. Our interest-rate 
sensitive business lines continued to be 
adversely impacted by low interest rates, but 
our net interest margin remained broadly 
stable during 2021 and the outlook is now 
significantly more positive. After absorbing the 
impact of low interest rates for some time, we 
believe we have turned the corner on revenue. 
We have also seen good fee income growth, 
good growth in mortgage balances and our 
lending pipelines across both retail and 
wholesale remain strong. Our insurance 
business also continues to perform well, 
notably in Asia where we have seen strong 
growth in value of new business, despite the 
border between Hong Kong and mainland 
China remaining closed.
As a consequence, the Group delivered 
$18.9bn of reported profit before tax, up 
$10.1bn on the prior year, and $21.9bn of 
adjusted profits, up 79%. We were profitable 
in every region, with Asia leading the way 
and material increases in profits in the UK, 
continental Europe, the US and the 
Middle East.
Adjusted revenue was down 3%, due mainly 
to the impact of interest rate cuts. However, 
trade balances grew by 23% overall, while 
loans and advances increased by $23bn for 
the year.
Our cost reduction programmes were able to 
absorb increased technology investment and 
higher performance-related pay, with adjusted 
operating expenses down by 1%. Return on 
tangible equity was 8.3%. If rates follow the 
path currently implied by the market, we 
would expect to reach a return on tangible 
equity of at least 10% for 2023, one year 
ahead of our previous expectations.
In the fourth quarter of 2021, we took a charge 
on expected credit losses, due to changing 
market conditions in the mainland China 
commercial real estate sector. Since the year 
end, there has been some positive sentiment 
as a consequence of new policy actions. They 
will take time to impact the market and we will 
continue to support our clients, with whom we 
have good and long-standing relationships.
Our funding, liquidity and capital all remain 
strong. We grew deposits by $90bn on a 
constant currency basis, with growth in all 
three global businesses. Our common equity 
tier 1 ratio was 15.8%. As a consequence, 
we are able to announce a second interim 
dividend of $0.18, bringing the full-year 
dividends for 2021 to $0.25 per ordinary share. 
This is within our target payout ratio, and our 
aim is for a sustainable dividend in 2022.

Strategic progress
In 2021, we made good progress 
against our strategic pillars.
We brought in 
$36.2bn 
of net new invested assets in Asia Wealth. 
We provided and facilitated 
$82.6bn 
of sustainable finance and investment. 
Our strong capital position and confidence in 
the business enabled us to announce a share 
buy-back of up to $2bn in October 2021. We 
also intend to initiate a further share buy-back 
of up to $1bn, to commence after the existing 
buy-back of up to $2bn has concluded. 
We are also helping to create sustainable 
returns for shareholders by driving underlying 
growth across the business. We have much 
more to do, but I am encouraged by what we 
have achieved so far.
Focus on our strengths
We have made good progress restructuring 
our portfolio of businesses, with the aim of 
investing in those areas in which we are 
strongest and withdrawing from those 
areas in which we lack the necessary  
scale to compete.
Over the last two years, we reduced gross  
risk-weighted assets by a cumulative $104bn, 
against our original three-year target of 
$110bn. Given this progress, we now expect 
to exceed this target by the end of 2022. In 
Global Banking and Markets, adjusted 
risk-weighted assets were 10% lower in 2021, 
as we moved capital and resources mainly into 
Asia and the Middle East. The extensive work 
undertaken to transform this business since 
2019 was also designed to mitigate the 
impact of Basel III reforms.
We reached two key milestones for our 
transformation as we took steps to resolve 
the future of our businesses in the US and 
continental Europe. In the US, we entered 
into an agreement to sell our mass market 
retail business, which has now been 
completed on schedule. We also entered into 
an agreement to sell our retail banking 
activities in France, which we expect to 
complete in 2023. Both deals will help our US 
and continental Europe businesses to become 
more focused, better aligned to the Group and 
the international needs of our wholesale and 
wealth management customers.
In Asia, we continued to enhance our wealth 
proposition, including through the launch of 
HSBC Greater Bay Area Connect and more 
than 30 new asset management products 
across the region. In December, we received 
regulatory approval to acquire the remaining 
50% stake in HSBC Life China, our joint 
venture insurance company in mainland China. 
All of this is enabling us to significantly expand 
our capabilities to serve the growing wealth 
and insurance needs of our customers in 
China, particularly in the Greater Bay Area.
We accelerated the development of our wealth 
capabilities across the rest of Asia by several 
years through two acquisitions. We entered 
into an agreement to buy AXA Singapore, 
which was completed earlier this month and 
will expand our insurance and wealth 
franchise in our ASEAN regional hub. We also 
agreed to buy L&T Investment Management 
to strengthen our asset management business 
in India. Both deals represent significant steps 
towards our ambition of being a leading 
wealth manager in Asia. 
The overall investment we have made in Asia 
wealth was evidenced by strong customer 
acquisition, and significantly increased assets 
and balances, year-on-year. Net new invested 
assets in Asia wealth were $36.2bn, which 
was more than double the previous year.
In Commercial Banking, we grew our lending 
by $11bn and our international account 
opening increased by 13% in 2021, while trade 
balances grew by 30% and are now above 
pre-pandemic levels. 
Digitise at scale
We invested $6bn in technology in 2021, 
as we continued to drive change in the  
way we approach technology across the 
organisation and ultimately improve the 
customer experience.
Around 97% of transactions are now fully 
automated. For example, automated credit 
and lending systems processed around $15bn 
of personal loans in 2021. Our use of the Cloud 
increased to cover 27% of technology 
services, giving us more processing power 
and speed, while we also increased our use 
of Agile across technology roles.
Almost half of our retail customers are now 
active on mobile, and we have developed new 
products and improved existing ones so we 
can better meet their needs. Our revamped 
mobile app is now available across 24 markets 
and Global Money was extended to more 
markets, allowing more of our international 
retail customers to hold, manage and send 
funds in various currencies. Corporate 
customers carried out over 9 million payments 
through the HSBCnet app – an increase of 58% 
year-on-year. HSBC Kinetic – our award-
winning mobile banking app for business 
customers in the UK – has acquired more than 
24,000 customers since it was launched.
Energise for growth
We have taken further steps to create a 
dynamic and inclusive culture, which helps 
us to attract and retain the best people.
After listening to our people, we introduced a 
hybrid working model, wherever appropriate, 
which allows us to strike the right balance 
between office-based work and home-based 
work. We have also taken the opportunity 
during Covid-19 to reconfigure much of our 
head office workspace to better facilitate 
team-based Agile working methods. We are 
still learning about what works, but we believe 
that trusting our colleagues to find the right 
balance is integral to building the culture we 
aspire to at HSBC. As a consequence of hybrid 
working, we will need less office space. In 
2021, we reduced our global office footprint 
by more than 3.4 million square feet – 
equivalent to 18%.
We were pleased to exceed our target for 
30% women in leadership roles globally in 
2020, and we set a new target of 35% by 
2025. HSBC was named in the Bloomberg 
Gender-Equality Index last month, with our 
overall score increasing by 21 percentage 
points in 2021 and outperforming the financial 
services average by 15 percentage points. 
We also continued to work to improve 
ethnicity representation, especially for Black 
colleagues. However, we still have a way to 
go to get to where we want, and need, to 
be on both measures.

assets without hindering growth. HSBC 
was presented with the Terra Carta seal by 
HRH the Prince of Wales in recognition of the 
work that we are doing to create truly 
sustainable markets. 
Transition to net zero
The industrial landscape of the world is being 
transformed by the transition to net zero. I am 
determined that HSBC will play a leading role 
in driving this change.
At the 2021 AGM, 99.7% of shareholders 
backed our special resolution on climate 
change, providing a strong endorsement 
of our climate plan and our commitment to 
support our customers on their transitions to 
a low-carbon future. However, we do not take 
this support for granted, and we have taken 
a number of further steps to maintain our 
leadership role.
In September, we partnered with Temasek, 
subject to regulatory approval, to launch a 
new debt financing fund for sustainable 
infrastructure in south-east Asia, with $150m 
of seed capital and the ambition to deploy 
$1bn of financing over five years. 
At the COP26 meeting in Glasgow, HSBC  
was one of over 100 public and private 
organisations behind the launch of FAST-Infra, 
a labelling system that aims to increase 
investor confidence in the sustainability 
credentials of projects in emerging markets. 
We are also supporting the Energy Transition 
Mechanism, a public-private partnership led 
by the Asian Development Bank that aims 
for the materially earlier retirement of coal 
After also joining the Powering Past Coal 
Alliance, we published a new thermal coal 
policy to phase out the financing of coal-fired 
power and thermal coal mining in EU and 
OECD markets by 2030, and globally by 2040. 
This fulfilled the commitment approved by  
our shareholders and followed a period of 
extensive engagement with our stakeholders. 
It has two clear objectives: to drive thermal 
coal phase-out within the timeframe required 
to reach net zero by 2050; and to help enable 
the energy transition in developing economies.
We are committed to working with our clients 
to develop valid, science-based transition 
plans to understand – sector-by-sector and 
client-by-client – how we will move to net zero 
by 2050. These transition plans and the targets 
within them must be predicated on the 
science relevant to the individual sectors. 
We will use them as a basis for further 
engagement and decision making, including 
how we drive change within our portfolios. 
As part of this process, we have disclosed 
interim targets for on-balance sheet financed 
emissions in the oil and gas, and power and 
utilities sectors. In the year ahead, we plan to 
set interim targets for financed emissions 
across a range of other sectors. We will also 
work on our climate transition plan, which will 
be published in 2023 and will bring together 
in one place how we will embed our net zero 
targets into our strategy, processes, policies 
and governance.
2022
We have good momentum coming into 2022 
and are confident that we can continue to 
execute against our strategy. We also remain 
cognisant of the potential impact that further 
Covid-19-related uncertainty and continued 
inflation might have on us and our clients.
Throughout HSBC’s history, our people have 
always demonstrated great professionalism 
and commitment to those we serve, and that 
is as evident today as it has ever been. Despite 
the personal and professional challenges they 
continue to face after two years of living with 
the pandemic, I am proud of my colleagues, 
and the sense of duty and care they continue 
to show towards our customers and each 
other. Our success – now and in the future – is 
testament to them and all they continue to do 
for our bank.

Strategic report
Our strategy
We are implementing our strategy across the four strategic pillars aligned to our purpose, 
values and ambition announced in February 2021.
Progress on our commitments in 2021
In 2021, we made good progress on our 
strategy across all of our global businesses. 
In Wealth and Personal Banking, we had 
strong wealth revenue momentum and 
augmented our fee generating portfolios  
with acquisitions in asset management and 
insurance to build further scale. In Commercial 
Banking, we saw strong growth in fee income, 
and momentum in trade volumes. In Global 
Banking and Markets, we had strong 
countercyclical revenue even as we exceeded 
our expectations on RWA rundowns and client 
exits. To support our global businesses, we 
also continued to invest in technology, develop 
our talent and culture, and play a role in the 
transition to a global net zero economy. 
Our efforts to date are paving the way for 
us to accelerate execution of the growth 
opportunities across our businesses and 
international network and, in turn, to help 
meet our targets and ambitions.
Shifting capital to areas with the highest returns and growth
In line with our strategy, we set out aspirations in February 2021 to accelerate the shift of capital and resources to areas that have demonstrated 
the highest returns and where we are strongest, principally in Asia, with a pivot to fee income generating businesses such as wealth. We saw 
strong progress across all parameters in 2021. While the proportion of fee and insurance income increased relative to 2020, reflecting fee and 
insurance revenue growth, this metric was also favourably impacted by lower net interest income due to 2020 interest rate reductions, as well  
as favourable market impacts in life insurance manufacturing.

financial targets may be found on page 26.
1 Given progress to date, we now expect to exceed our $110bn reduction target by the end of 2022.
2  In line with our dividend policy, we retain the flexibility to adjust earnings per ordinary share (‘EPS’) for non-cash significant items. In 2022, we intend to adjust EPS 
to exclude the forecast loss on the sale of our retail banking operations in France.
3 If policy rates were to follow the current implied market consensus, we would expect to deliver a return on average tangible equity (‘RoTE’) of at least 10% for 2023.

Our strategy
Our strategy
Our strategy centres around four key areas: focus on our areas of strengths, digitise at scale to adapt our operating model for the future, energise 
our organisation for growth, and support the transition to a net zero global economy.
Focus on our strengths
In our global businesses
In each of our global businesses, we continue to focus on areas where we are strongest and have opportunities to grow. 
Wealth and Personal Banking
In Wealth and Personal Banking, we have 
continued to make progress in the execution 
of our wealth, asset management and 
insurance strategy, notably in Asia. We grew 
our net new invested assets from $53bn in 
2020 to $64bn, with $36bn coming from Asia, 
where we saw an increase of 138%. This 
contributed to a 5% increase in Wealth and 
Personal Banking wealth balances to $1.67tn, 
including 5% growth in Asset Management’s 
funds under management to $630bn. In Asia, 
Wealth and Personal Banking wealth revenue 
– which comprises wealth, insurance, private 
banking, and asset management – grew by 
10% to $5.8bn. This included a 40% growth in 
value of new business in insurance to $917m. 
We continued to enhance our wealth product 
offerings in the region, including launching 
Greater Bay Area Wealth Management 
Connect, and over 30 new asset management 
products. Globally, Wealth and Personal 
Banking customer lending balances were 
$489bn, an increase of 6% compared with 
2020, notably reflecting mortgage balance 
growth across all regions, but particularly in 
the UK and Hong Kong.
Commercial Banking
Our Commercial Banking business continued 
to grow our lending pipeline and maintain 
leadership in supporting cross-border trade. 
Customer lending volume increased 3% to 
$349bn in 2021, mainly from continued 
growth in trade and term lending. The 
recovery in global trade volumes was also 
reflected in higher fee income in Global Trade 
and Receivables Finance, where we saw a  
9% revenue growth compared with 2020. 
Over the same period, fee income in the 
overall Commercial Banking business also 
grew 9%, reaching approximately $3.6bn and 
surpassing pre-pandemic levels in 2019. 
We also committed to investing in global 
platforms and improving SME propositions 
in our key markets. Since the launch of our 
digital business banking account Kinetic in 
the UK in August 2020, we have reached 
approximately 24,000 customers at the 
end of 2021.
Global Banking and Markets
We repositioned our capital and resources in 
Global Banking and Markets to create capacity 
for growth opportunities, mainly into Asia and 
the Middle East, and to serve international 
clients that are aligned to our strategy. As part 
of our transformation programme, we reduced 
adjusted RWAs by approximately 10% to 
$236bn at 31 December 2021, driven by saves 
in our Western franchise, comprising our 
Europe and Americas businesses. Despite  
the focus on repositioning, the business 
performed well in 2021, with overall revenue 
reaching approximately $15bn, driven by 
strong performances in Equities, Capital 
Markets and Advisory and Securities Services. 
Collaboration with other businesses through 
cross-selling products remains important for 
us. In 2021, the business facilitated $2.5bn  
into Commercial Banking, an increase of 12% 
compared with 2020, and $1.4bn into Wealth 
and Personal Banking, an increase of 2%.

Repositioning for growth
We are repositioning our portfolio to support our areas of growth.
Restructuring the US and Europe
We aim to create capacity for growth by 
refocusing our US business and HSBC Bank 
plc, our non-ring-fenced bank in Europe and 
the UK. In May and June respectively, we 
announced the exit of mass market retail in the 
US, and the planned sale of our retail 
operations in France. Our plan to exit our US 
mass market retail banking business was 
completed in February 2022, which includes 
approximately $8.8bn of deposits held for sale 
and exiting and winding down approximately 
125 branches, leaving us with approximately 
25 international wealth centres. The planned 
sale of our France retail business includes a 
network (using values at 31 December 2021) 
of 244 retail branches, approximately 800,000 
customers, $24.9bn in customer loans and 
$22.6bn in deposits balances.
We also made strong progress in 2021 on 
reducing the capital and cost base in the 
two franchises. During the year, adjusted 
RWAs decreased $7bn in the US to $78bn at 
31 December 2021, while in HSBC Bank plc,  
they decreased by $22bn to $141bn. The 
respective balances at 31 December 2021 
included approximately $1.3bn relating to the 
announced US mass market retail disposal 
and approximately $7bn relating to the 
planned disposal of our France retail business. 
We also lowered the adjusted cost base in 
these franchises by 5% compared with 2020 
to $10.4bn, in spite of strong inflationary 
pressures in these markets.
Repositioning Asia for growth
We announced three key acquisitions in 2021 
to further strengthen our wealth franchise in 
Asia. In August, we entered an agreement to 
acquire AXA Singapore for $529m, with the 
intention to merge the business with the 
operations of our existing HSBC Life Singapore 
franchise. The acquisition was recently 
completed on 11 February 2022. The 
combined business would be the seventh 
largest life insurer in Singapore, based on 
annualised new premiums, and the fourth 
largest retail health insurer, based on gross 
premiums, with over 600,000 policies in-force, 
data as of end of 2020. In December, we 
announced the agreement to fully acquire 
L&T Investment Management, the 12th largest 
mutual fund management company in India 
with assets under management of $10.8bn 
and over 2.4 million portfolios as of September 
2021. We also received regulatory approval to 
acquire the remaining 50% stake in HSBC Life 
China, bringing our shareholder ownership to 
100% upon completion.

Strategic report | Our strategy
Digitise at scale
We continue to invest in our technology and 
operational capabilities to drive operating 
productivity across businesses and 
geographies and to offer better client 
experience. In 2021, approximately $6.0bn, 
or 19%, of our overall adjusted operating 
expenses were dedicated to technology (net 
of saves from our transformation programme), 
up from approximately $5.7bn in 2020. We 
aspire to progressively increase the share 
to greater than 21% by 2025. 
We have made progress on automating our 
organisation at scale. Our Cloud adoption rate, 
which is the percentage of our technology 
services on the private or public Cloud, 
increased from approximately 20% in 2020 to 
27% in 2021. We are also promoting an agile 
workforce to help equip our colleagues for 
the future of work. At the end of 2021, 15% 
of our total technology workforce in the 
global businesses and functions were aligned 
to at least one agile team per agile blueprint. 
This marks a significant improvement from 
5% in 2020.
Our digital engagement with customers also 
improved. At the end of 2021, 43% of our 
customers active on our mobile services had 
logged onto a HSBC mobile app at least once 
in the last 30 days, compared with 38% in 
2020. Our wholesale clients executed over 
9 million payments on HSBCnet’s mobile 
banking app, a 58% increase compared with 
2020. During the same period, the percentage 
of Commercial Banking transactions enabled 
digitally for HSBCnet grew from 83% to 94% 
in the 18 Asian markets where HSBCnet is 
available for wholesale clients. Across all our 
trade digital channels, 84% of transactions in 
2021 were initiated digitally by our customers, 
compared with 69% of transactions in 2020. 
Seeing these improvements, we endeavour 
to continue investing in technology that helps 
enhance our customers’ digital experiences.

Energise for growth 
In February 2021, we set out the case for 
a more effective, agile and empowered 
organisation that could execute on our 
ambitious journey. 
In 2021, our employee engagement score, 
a gauge of an employee’s propensity to 
recommend HSBC as a great place to work, 
was in line with 2020 at 72%, but notably up 
from 67% in 2019. This represents a strong 
endorsement of various initiatives around our 
purpose and values in our organisation.
Transition to net zero
Recruiting the right talent and diversifying our 
workforce remain important to us. We had 
31.7% of senior leadership roles held by 
women, which are roles classified as those 
at band 3 and above in our global career 
band structure. We are on track to meet 
our ambition of having more than 35% 
representation of women in these roles 
by 2025. 
We continue to energise our colleagues 
through initiatives that help develop their 
future skills and learning opportunities, 
especially in areas including data, digital and 
sustainability. In 2021, the average hours of 
training per full-time equivalent staff ('FTE')
increased to 26.7 hours from 23.0 hours 
in 2020. 
 We outline how we put our purpose and values 
into practice in the following 'How we do 
business' section. For further details on how 
we plan to energise for growth, see the Social 
section in the ESG review on page 66.
In November, we participated in COP26 to play 
our part in bringing together the public and 
private sector to mobilise this transition. We 
also made good progress on our ambitions, 
including setting targets for our on-balance 
sheet financed emissions and launching 
innovative climate solutions and products 
to support our customers in their transition 
to a net zero future. 
a policy to phase out thermal coal financing in 
EU and OECD markets by 2030, and globally 
by 2040. We have also set targets for our 
on-balance sheet financed emissions for the 
oil and gas, and power and utilities sectors. 
On the journey to net zero, we recognise that 
individual markets have their own unique 
circumstances that we intend to factor in 
when laying out our net zero approach.
Becoming a net zero bank
We have set a climate ambition to become net 
zero in our operations and supply chain by 
2030, and align our financed emissions to the 
Paris Agreement goal of net zero by 2050. In 
2021, we reduced our organisation’s absolute 
greenhouse gas emissions in our operations to 
341,000 tonnes, a decrease of 50.3% from the 
2019 baseline (the data for 2019 and 2020 has 
been revised as we have updated our air travel 
reporting methodology to include the cabin 
class travel and the impact of radiative forces, 
and therefore, the percentage change from 
2019 baseline is based on the revised 
methodology). In December, we published 
Supporting customers through transition
Our ambition is to support our customers in 
their transition to net zero and a sustainable 
future. In 2021, we provided and facilitated 
$82.6bn of sustainable finance and 
investment, taking the cumulative amount 
to $126.7bn since 1 January 2020, as part of 
our $750bn to $1tn by 2030 ambition. This 
comprised support including facilitation of 
capital flow and access to capital markets 
for sustainability-linked outcomes, as well as 
financing and investments in environmental 
and social goals such as decarbonisation of 
energy systems.
Unlocking new climate solutions 
Scaled innovation in critical areas such as next 
generation climate technologies, nature-based 
solutions and sustainable infrastructure will be 
critical to tackling climate change. In 
September, we launched a new debt financing 
fund for sustainable infrastructure in south-
east Asia in partnership (subject to regulatory 
approval) with Temasek, with $150m of seed 
capital and the ambition to deploy $1bn of 
financing over five years. We are leading the 
FAST-Infra initiative, which we co-founded 
to establish a consistent, globally applicable 
labelling system to identify and evaluate 
sustainable infrastructure assets. We are also 
supporting the Energy Transition Mechanism, 
a public-private partnership led by the Asian 
Development Bank, which endeavours to 
accelerate the retirement of coal-fired power 
stations and increase demand and 
investments in renewable energy. 
 For further details on our climate ambition, see 
the Environmental section in the ESG review 
on page 45.

How we do business
 How we do business
We conduct our business intent on supporting the sustained success of our customers,  
people and other stakeholders.
Our approach
We recognise that it is important to be clear 
about who we are and what we stand for to 
create long-term value for our stakeholders. 
This will help us deliver our strategy and 
operate our business in a way that is 
sustainable. Following an extensive 
consultation with our people and customers, 
we refined our purpose and values. Our new 
purpose is ‘Opening up a world of opportunity’ 
and our ambition is to be the preferred 
international financial partner for our clients.
To achieve this in a way that is sustainable, we 
are guided by our values: we value difference; 
we succeed together; we take responsibility; 
and we get it done.
Our Covid-19 actions
Having a clear purpose and strong values has 
never been more important, with the Covid-19 
pandemic testing us all in ways we could 
never have anticipated. Since the world 
changed in 2020, we adapted to new ways of 
working and endeavoured to provide support 
to our customers during this challenging 
period. On the following page, we have set 
out further ways that we continued to support 
our stakeholders.
Fair outcomes
Our conduct approach guides us to do the 
right thing and to focus on the impact we have 
for our customers and the financial markets in 
which we operate. It complements our 
purpose and values and – together with more 
formal policies and the tools we have to do our 
jobs – provides a clear path to achieving our 
purpose and delivering our strategy. For 
further information on conduct, see page 83. 
For further details on our purpose-led conduct 
approach framework, see www.hsbc.com/
who-we-are.
Developing the skills of colleagues is critical 
to energising our organisation. We foster a 
culture of learning through a range of 
resources, providing colleagues with a breadth 
of educational materials and opportunities. 
As we continue to reshape the organisation, 
we are committed to managing change well, 
and redeploying impacted colleagues. In 2021, 
23% of colleagues impacted through 
restructuring programmes found new jobs 
within HSBC.
Our climate ambition
We have set a climate ambition to become net 
zero in our operations and our supply chain by 
2030, and align our financed emissions to the 
Paris Agreement goal of net zero by 2050. We 
have set on-balance sheet financed emissions 
targets for the oil and gas, and power and 
utilities sectors, aligned to the International 
Energy Agency’s (‘IEA’) net zero scenario, 
underpinned by a clear science-based 
strategy. To support our goal of net zero

Our colleagues
Understanding the experience of colleagues 
is central to our efforts to open up a world of 
opportunity. Through our employee survey, 
Snapshot, we capture their views on issues 
from our strategy to their well-being to the 
future of work. These views will guide our 
approach as we embrace hybrid working. 
We value difference among our colleagues, 
which is why we continue to build an inclusive 
workforce. Having surpassed our 2020 target 
to reach 30% women in senior leadership 
roles – classified as those at band 3 and above 
in our global career band structure – we have 
made strong progress towards our goal to 
achieve 35% by 2025, with 31.7% achieved 
in 2021.
We expanded the ability for our colleagues to 
share their diversity characteristics, with over 
70% now able to self-identify their ethnic 
heritage, gender identity, disability and sexual 
orientation. This will help us to set locally 
appropriate goals, reflective of our markets. 
In July 2020, we set out our early global race 
commitments, which included the goal of 
doubling the number of Black employees in 
senior roles over the following five years. In 
2021, we put in place important foundations 
to achieve this goal. 
Update on our purpose and values
We relaunched our purpose in March 2021. 
We have been pleased to see how quickly 
our colleagues have embraced 'Opening up 
a world of opportunity’ as our purpose, and 
how they are delivering against it. You can 
find some examples from 2021 below. 
We have enabled the recognition of 
colleagues who have lived up to our 
values, and there have been over 600,000 
recognitions made in 2021.
 – We helped 268,771 people buy their first 
home, lending $92.9bn in mortgages. 
 – We provided $47bn in loans to our 
business banking customers to help 
support, grow, internationalise and digitise 
their businesses.
 – We facilitated $799bn of trade globally 
to help economies grow and prosper.
 – We supported over 270,000 students 
move internationally to study by providing 
key financial products including account 
openings, fund transfer and day-to-day 
finance management in their new countries.
 – Over 115,000 colleagues made use of 
our new learning platform, Degreed, 
during 2021.
 – We enabled over 30,000 colleagues to 
progress their careers at the Group by 
helping them move into new roles.

",Mark E Tucker,Group Chairman,"HSBC made progress in its strategic plan with the organic build-out of HSBC Personal Wealth Planning in mainland China. The company observed China's strong recovery followed by a growth slowdown in H2 2021, expecting government action to ease monetary and fiscal policies to shore up growth. HSBC acknowledges the US-China relationship as a 'prominent feature' but expects mutual economic benefits from the UK-China relationship to outweigh short-term pressures, affirming its commitment to serving customers globally. Its insurance business in Asia showed strong growth despite border closures with mainland China. However, a charge for expected credit losses was taken due to changing market conditions in the mainland China commercial real estate sector, though positive sentiment emerged post-year-end due to new policy actions. HSBC also gained regulatory approval to acquire the remaining 50% stake in HSBC Life China, aiming to significantly expand its wealth and insurance capabilities, especially in the Greater Bay Area.","Cautious engagement with strategic expansion. HSBC is actively investing and expanding in China's wealth and insurance sectors, recognizing its growth potential. However, it also acknowledges economic slowdowns, specific market risks (commercial real estate), and geopolitical tensions, indicating a balanced approach of pursuing opportunities while managing inherent complexities and uncertainties.",Shareholder Letter

Thoroughly Reaffirming Toyota’s Founding Principles
Worldwide competition in the automotive industry is growing more intense, as demonstrated by 
increasing demand for innovative and competitively priced products that meet unique customer 
needs.  In  addition,  environmental  concerns  are  becoming  a  higher  priority  for  the  international 
community.
　Toyota’s  70-year  history  has  been  very  valuable  in  helping  the  Company  address  the  major 
challenges  it  faces  today.  We  have  experienced  recessions,  automobile  trade  liberalization, 
environmental  concerns,  oil  shocks  and  other  major  changes  in  the  operating  environment. 
In  each  case,  we  remained  faithful  to  our  founding  principles  of  contributing  to  society.  With 
humility,  we  learned  and  evolved.  The  current  difficulties  have  given  us  cause  to  reaffirm  these 
principles.  We  are  confident  that  by  providing  safe,  high-quality  vehicles  at  affordable  prices, 
the  starting  point  for  growth,  we  can  overcome  the  issues  we  now  face  by  adhering  steadfastly 
to  customer-first, Genchi Genbutsu (on-site,  hands-on  experience)  principles  and  striving  for 
continuous improvement.
Building the Automobile of the Future
The  automobile  industry  is  being  driven  by  advances  in  environmental  technology.  Toyota 
will  work  to  improve  its  technology,  while  broadening  its  strategy  of  sustainable  mobility  to 
include  new  technologies  and  products,  partnerships,  the  urban  environment  and  energy.  By

Significant investment in technology and process 
redesign is now not only delivering greater cost 
efficiency but also is poised to markedly enhance 
our ability to detect and prevent financial crime.  
In addition, 2017 will see the progressive launch  
of applications that will materially improve our 
customers’ digital experience, enhance their  
online security and bring greater personalisation  
of product offerings.
While there is still a long way to go, it was 
encouraging to see the significant improvement  
in performance across all business units in  
Mexico following the substantial repositioning  
of the Group’s operations there. This contributed  
to the Group’s success in replacing substantially  
all of the revenues given up through continuing 
run-off of legacy portfolios, risk mitigation in  
areas exposed to higher threat of financial crime 
and reduction in trading books.
Furthermore, HSBC is safer today from the threat 
of financial crime because of the investments  
we have been making in our Global Standards 
programme. The Board remains fully committed  
to our work in this area in 2017 and beyond.
Regulatory matters
It was extremely disappointing that the regulatory 
community was unable to achieve its targeted 
completion of the Basel III framework in January 
2017 on the consensual basis expected. It is now 
almost 10 years since the commencement of the 
global financial crisis and it is time to draw a line 
under further regulatory changes, particularly since 
there is no doubt that our industry is more strongly 
capitalised, better governed and more risk aware 
than it was a decade ago. Finalisation of the 
structure and calibration of the capital framework 
is crucial to give banks certainty over prospective 
capital allocations in support of lending and market 
activities. This is particularly important at this time 
when public policy is focusing on encouraging 
greater support for longer-dated assets, including 
infrastructure, and seeking to build out the capital 
markets of Europe and emerging markets. It is 
hugely important that regulators and policy makers 
now move as quickly as possible to finalise the 
capital framework in line with their stated 
commitment to deliver that framework without  
a significant, broad-based increase in capital 
requirements. Equally important is the avoidance  
of fragmentation in the global regulatory 
architecture as the new US administration 
reconsiders its participation in international 
regulatory forums. The best outcome would be 
early global agreement on unresolved issues, 
followed by an extended period of regulatory 
stability to allow familiarity and experience to be 
gained from what has been put in place. 
We made further progress in 2016 on completing 
the resolution planning required of us as a global 
systemically important bank (‘G-SIB’). This involved 
removing or mitigating residual constraints on the 
clarity of the Group’s core college of regulators’ 
approach to winding down the Group, should  
this ever be necessary. While clearly we do  
not envisage such circumstances as other  
than extremely remote, completion of a  
comprehensive resolution framework is a 
necessary pillar supporting HSBC’s ability to 
continue to operate as one of the world’s G-SIBs. 
Indeed, our strategy is built around maintaining  
the scale and the reach of our international 
network, which in 2016 again demonstrated its 
resilience and competitive advantages.
Tangible benefits accrue to our shareholders  
from the detailed work done with our regulators  
to demonstrate the strength of our capital position 
and the effectiveness of our resolution planning. 
Beyond supporting the maintenance of our 
dividend, in 2016 management’s efforts created 
the capacity to return capital to shareholders  
by way of a share buy-back and demonstrated 
justification for a reduction in the additional  
capital buffer applied to HSBC as a G-SIB.
UK referendum on EU membership
Not a great deal has changed since we reported  
at the interim stage, given that the UK has still to 
trigger its formal exit notice and so no negotiations 
have taken place. We welcomed, however, the 
additional clarity given to the Government’s 
position in the recent speech by the Prime Minister. 
The scale of the challenge of negotiating across the 
entire economic landscape, as well as addressing 
the legislative and other public policy adjustments 
that will be required, has become clearer. We 
believe there is now, as a consequence, a widely 
shared recognition that an implementation phase 
between the current position and the one that  
is ultimately negotiated will be necessary; we 
strongly endorse this view. 
Since the referendum we have focused on  
advising clients on the implications of leaving  
the EU for their businesses. We have also been 
responding to UK Government outreach seeking 
guidance on which elements of the current 
EU-based legal and regulatory arrangements  
it should focus on to preserve the essential role 
that financial markets based in the UK play in 
supporting European trade and investment activity.
For our own part, we have broadly all the licences 
and infrastructure needed to continue to support 
our clients once the UK leaves the EU. This largely 
derives from our position in France where we  
are the sixth largest bank with a full range of 
capabilities. Current contingency planning suggests 
we may need to relocate some 1,000 roles from 
London to Paris progressively over the next two 
years, depending on how negotiations develop.

Strategic Report | Group Chairman’s Statement
Board changes
We welcomed Jackson Tai to the Board on  
12 September last year. Jack brings a rare 
combination of hands-on banking expertise,  
top level governance experience and a deep 
knowledge of Asia and China. These attributes 
were accumulated in a 25-year career at  
J.P. Morgan & Co., both in the US and in Asia,  
and subsequently in senior roles at DBS, the 
leading Singapore-based regional banking group, 
where Jack latterly led its regional expansion as 
Vice Chairman and CEO. Jack was appointed a 
member of the Financial System Vulnerabilities 
Committee and the Group Risk Committee.
At the forthcoming AGM we shall bid farewell to 
our two longest-serving independent directors, 
namely, our Senior Independent Director, Rachel 
Lomax, and Sam Laidlaw. Rachel during her tenure 
has served on the Audit, Risk and Nomination 
Committees, and took responsibility as the first 
Chair of the Conduct & Values Committee to 
establish its terms of reference and its agenda. 
Sam served on, and latterly chaired, both the 
Remuneration and Nomination Committees. 
Together, Rachel and Sam have also been leading 
the process to manage my own succession. Their 
combined knowledge of regulatory and public 
policy, business leadership, corporate governance 
and consumer issues has been invaluable to the 
Board. On behalf of all shareholders, I want to 
thank them for their dedication and commitment.
Chairman succession
In the Circular inviting shareholders to the 2016 
AGM, I indicated that the process to find my own 
successor had been initiated with the intention of 
having this concluded during 2017. This process 
remains on track and an announcement will be 
made in due course.
Outlook
We have recently upgraded our forecasts for global 
economic growth reflecting the likelihood of a shift 
in US fiscal policy and a broader based cyclical 
recovery. As in recent years, incremental growth is 
expected to be driven by emerging economies in 
which HSBC is well represented. Risks to this 
central scenario, however, remain high. In 
particular, we highlight the threat of populism 
impacting policy choices in upcoming European 
elections, possible protectionist measures from the 
new US administration impacting global trade, 
uncertainties facing the UK and the EU as they 
enter Brexit negotiations, and the impact of a 
stronger dollar on emerging economies with  
high debt levels.
Countering these factors are signs of a cyclical 
upturn. Global purchasing manager indices are  
at their strongest for some time, the US economy 
looks robust and growth in China has held up  
well, defying the concerns reflected in the market 
retrenchment seen in the first quarter of 2016. 
Additionally, commodity prices have risen, 
reflecting optimism regarding growth in 
infrastructure investment as well as agreement 
reached to cut oil supply. These factors also imply 
reflation across the major economies and rising 
interest rates, which would benefit HSBC’s 
conservative balance sheet structure.
‘We enter 2017 with the restructuring  
of the Group essentially completed,  
and with a strong capital position  
and a conservative balance sheet’
However, it is fair to reflect that the upgrades to 
economic growth we are now forecasting are 
largely the partial reversal of downgrades made 
last year when uncertainty was elevated as a result 
of the unexpected political events. Forecast global 
growth remains slightly lower than its long-term 
trend with risks largely to the downside.
We enter 2017 with the restructuring of the Group 
essentially completed, and with a strong capital 
position and a conservative balance sheet. We are 
gaining market share in areas of importance to 
HSBC as others scale back and our offerings 
become more competitive. Much of the heavy 
investment in reshaping the Group to improve 
productivity, embrace technological change and 
reinforce global standards of business conduct  
has been made. 
As ever, we owe a huge amount to our 235,000 
colleagues who have delivered this change at the 
same time as working tirelessly to meet customers’ 
expectations of them. On behalf of the Board,  
I want to thank them all for their dedication  
and commitment.

border mergers and acquisitions. HSBC was 
recognised as the ‘World’s Best Investment Bank’ 
and ‘World’s Best Bank for Corporates’ at the 
Euromoney Awards for Excellence 2016.
Commercial Banking performed well, particularly 
in the UK and Hong Kong, growing adjusted 
revenue in spite of a slow-down in global trade. 
Gains in Global Liquidity and Cash Management, 
and Credit and Lending, exceeded the reduction  
in trade finance revenue. Global Trade and 
Receivables Finance continued to capture market 
share in major markets including Hong Kong and 
Singapore, maintaining our position as the world’s 
number one trade finance bank. 
Retail Banking and Wealth Management 
performance was mixed. Overall adjusted revenue 
was down, due largely to the impact of reduced 
client activity in Hong Kong on our Wealth 
Management businesses. At the same time, strong 
mortgage balance growth in the UK, Hong Kong 
and mainland China, and higher current account 
and savings balances in the UK and Hong Kong, 
helped increase revenue in Retail Banking. These 
increased balances should support revenue growth 
in 2017 and beyond. 
We have considered it appropriate to write off  
the remaining goodwill in the European private 
banking business. This goodwill relates principally 
to the original purchase of Safra Republic Holdings 
in 1999. The restructuring of Global Private 
Banking is now largely complete, and although 
Global Private Banking is now much smaller  
than it was three years ago, it is deliberately 
positioned for sustainable growth with a focus  
on serving the personal wealth management 
needs of the leadership and owners of the  
Group’s corporate clients.
Our cost-reduction programmes continue to  
bring down our adjusted operating expenses.  
The traction that these programmes have gained in 
the last 18 months has enabled us to increase the 
amount of costs that we are able to remove from 
the business. We now expect to deliver annualised 
cost savings of around $6bn by the end of 2017, 
and will invest an equivalent total of around $6bn 
over the same time-frame in order to achieve this.

Stuart Gulliver Group Chief Executive
We made good progress in 2016. The 
implementation of our strategic actions is well 
advanced and our global universal business model 
performed well in challenging conditions. Our 
reported profit before tax reflected a number of 
large significant items, including a write-off of all  
the remaining goodwill in Global Private Banking in 
Europe, an accounting loss on the sale of our Brazil 
business, and investments to achieve our cost-
saving target. Our adjusted profits were broadly 
unchanged year on year following solid 
performances by our global businesses. These 
enabled us to capture market share in strategic 
product areas and build a platform for future 
growth. We delivered positive adjusted jaws in 2016.
Performance
Global Banking and Markets recovered from a 
sector-wide slow start to generate higher adjusted 
revenue than for 2015. Our Markets businesses 
performed well in challenging conditions, 
particularly in Fixed Income products. Our 
transaction banking businesses also grew revenue, 
especially Global Liquidity and Cash Management. 
We made market share gains in Fixed Income in 
Europe, and achieved our best ever league table 
rankings in global debt capital markets and cross-

Strategic Report | Group Chief Executive’s Review
These savings should more than compensate for 
additional investment in regulatory programmes 
and compliance. 
We continue to make strong progress in 
implementing our strategic actions to improve 
returns and gain maximum value from our 
international network. We are on course to 
complete the majority of these actions by the  
end of 2017 (see pages 12 to 13), in line with our 
targets. Our targeted reduction of risk-weighted 
assets is 97% complete, and the success of our 
cost saving programmes means that we now 
expect to exceed our cost reduction target. 
The turnaround of our Mexico business  
continues to accelerate. Improved lending and 
deposit balances, interest rate rises and better 
collaboration between businesses helped generate 
significantly higher profits compared with 2015. 
We also made significant market share gains, 
particularly in consumer lending. 
We have continued to enhance our business  
in Asia-Pacific, launching our first exclusively 
HSBC-branded credit card in mainland China, 
growing assets under management and insurance 
new business premiums, and increasing loans  
in the Pearl River Delta. We also extended our 
leadership of the offshore renminbi bond market 
and achieved our best ranking for China outbound 
mergers and acquisitions since 2003.
We are better protected from financial crime 
because of the investment we have made in  
our Global Standards programme. Our Monitor  
has raised certain concerns, but we have 
continued to progress and our commitment 
remains unwavering. By the end of this year, we 
are on track to have our anti-money laundering  
and sanctions policy framework in place and to 
have introduced major compliance IT systems 
across the Group. Beyond 2017, we will continue  
to work to fine tune those systems and to ensure 
that our improvements are fully integrated into  
our day-to-day risk management practices.
Our strong common equity tier 1 ratio of 13.6% 
reinforces our ability to support the dividend,  
invest in the business and manage the continuing 
uncertain regulatory environment.
Delivering value for shareholders
In December, we completed the $2.5bn equity 
buy-back that we commenced at the half-year.  
We are also now in a position to retire more of 
the capital that previously supported the Brazil 
business. Having received the appropriate 
regulatory clearances, we will therefore execute  
a further share buy-back of up to $1bn in the first 
half of 2017. This will bring the total value of shares 
repurchased since last August to $3.5bn.
We will continue to contemplate further share 
buy-backs as circumstances permit, and  
we remain confident of sustaining the annual 
dividend at the current level for the foreseeable 
future through the long-term earnings capacity  
of the business.
A business fit for the future
While our strategic actions are improving our 
network, we are also anticipating and adapting  
to the social, economic and technological trends 
that are changing our operating environment and 
our customers’ needs and expectations.
The adoption of rapidly evolving digital 
technologies by our customers is arguably the 
most transformative force for the financial services 
industry. Through our global network, we are able 
to identify and respond to digital trends across  
70 countries and territories, applying the 
technologies that provide the greatest benefit to 
our customers. We are investing $2.1bn in digital 
transformation in Retail Banking and Wealth 
Management, Commercial Banking, and Global 
Banking and Markets between 2015 and the  
end of 2020, and we have already launched 
innovative ways to make banking faster, easier  
and safer. HSBC is now the biggest financial 
services user of biometrics globally, and we 
continue to roll out voice recognition and 
fingerprint technology across our network. In 2016, 
we enhanced our internet and mobile banking 
platforms in several of our key markets, including 
the UK and Hong Kong, and launched innovation 
labs around the world dedicated to the application 
of artificial intelligence, data management and 
improvements in cybersecurity. These labs, 
together with our fintech partnerships, will help  
us use technology to deliver better banking for  
our customers.

If digital technology is mankind’s greatest 
opportunity, preventing climate change is its 
greatest challenge. The Paris Agreement of 
December 2015 reflected a new consensus on  
the need to strengthen the global response to 
climate change. Major injections of capital are  
now required to finance new technologies, 
infrastructure and the transition of traditional 
industries from high to low carbon, and to cover 
the costs of climate adaptation. As the principal 
intermediaries between entrepreneurs, businesses 
and investors, banks have a responsibility to help 
direct this flow of capital. We are already working 
with our clients and with investors to help them 
allocate capital and direct finance towards lower-
carbon, carbon-resilient activities, and in 2016  
we established a Sustainable Financing Unit to 
coordinate this work across business lines. 
Headquartered in London, but with resources  
in New York and Hong Kong, this new unit will 
support colleagues tasked with creating and 
delivering innovative climate products, and help 
them uncover new sources of sustainable finance. 
‘The changes we have made since 2011 have 
equipped HSBC to improve returns and gain 
maximum value from our international network’
We are also seeking to influence client practices 
and to build the data, the tools and the 
transparency necessary to embed understanding 
of climate risk into the way that markets function. 
In 2016, HSBC Global Research expanded its 
coverage of environment, social and corporate 
governance factors to give our clients the 
information they need to inform their investment 
decisions. This builds on the work of the world-
leading HSBC Climate Change Centre for 
Excellence, which in 2017 celebrates 10 years  
of delivering market-leading information on climate 
policy to clients across the globe. Work is also 
underway to expand the Group’s disclosure of 
non-financial data to meet the needs of 
shareholders and other stakeholders.
We are investing to adapt to the changing face  
of trade. As the world’s largest trade finance bank 
with more than 150 years’ experience at both ends 
of the world’s busiest trade routes, we are perfectly 
placed to help modernise and digitise long-
standing trade finance methods, many of which 
would still be recognisable to HSBC’s founders.  
We are already working with a broad coalition  
of partners around the world to make the promise  
of blockchain technology a reality with regards  
to trade finance. HSBC has already helped develop  
a blockchain prototype for a letter of credit that 
confirms the possibility of sharing information 
between all parties on a private distributed  
ledger. In early 2017, we signed a memorandum  
of understanding with six other banks to make 
domestic and cross-border commerce easier  
for European SMEs using blockchain technology. 
We are also seeking to create ways of financing  
the growing services trade, which we estimate  
will account for a quarter of global trade by 2030.  
At a time when international politics threaten to 
increase rather than decrease the cost of trade,  
we will continue to invest both time and resources 
to find ways of making trade finance cheaper, 
faster, simpler and more secure for our customers. 
Looking forward
We anticipate new challenges in 2017 from 
geopolitical developments, heightened trade 
barriers and regulatory uncertainty. However, the 
changes we have made since 2011 have equipped 
HSBC to manage the complexity of today’s global 
business environment. HSBC is a strong and 
resilient business with a global universal business 
model geared to find growth opportunities in a 
low-growth world. If globalisation continues to 
retreat, as seems likely, we are in a strong position 
to capitalise on the regional opportunities that this 
will present, particularly in Asia and Europe. Most 
importantly, the strength of our network gives us 
an unrivalled ability to help our clients navigate  
that same complexity and overcome their own 
challenges, whether exploring new markets or 
making the transition to a low-carbon economy.

Our strategy
We have developed a long-term strategy  
that reflects our purpose and enables us to  
capture value from our international network. 
Develop our  
international network 
To facilitate international trade and capital flows and 
serve our clients, with potential to help them grow 
from small enterprises into large multinationals.
Invest in wealth and  
retail businesses with local scale
To make the most of global social mobility, wealth 
creation and long-term demographic changes  
in our priority markets. 
Value of the network and our strategy
Access to global  
growth opportunities
Our unparalleled network  
covers countries accounting for 
more than 90% of global GDP,  
trade and capital flows. We have  
a leading presence in large and 
fast-growing economies.
Our priority markets cover both 
sides of 11 of the world’s 15 largest 
trade corridors for goods and 
services forecast for 2030, and 
represent at least one side of the 
other four corridors. Six of the 15 
corridors are within Asia and five 
connect countries between two 
geographical regions.
Lower risk profile and volatility  
from our diversified, universal 
banking model
Our 10-year profit before tax 
volatility of 0.9x compares 
favourably with our peers.
Transaction banking product 
revenue of $14.7bn on an adjusted 
basis leads the industry. More than 
45% of our client revenue comes 
from businesses and individuals 
with an international presence.
Business synergies of $10.5bn, 
equivalent to 22% of reported 
revenue reflect products and 
services provided across our  
global businesses.
Strong capital and funding base
CET1 ratio of 13.6%, supported by 
increased shareholders’ equity to 
meet new regulatory requirements 
since the end of 2010.
Four interconnected, global 
businesses share balance sheets 
and liquidity in addition to strong 
commercial links.
Stable shareholder returns
Industry leading dividend – 
approximately $55bn declared from 
2011 to 2016, as well as circa 
$2.5bn of share repurchases.

Long-term trends
Our strategy positions us  
to capitalise on several  
long-term trends.
Increasing connectivity and 
global flows of trade, finance 
and data are key drivers of 
GDP growth.

Strategic actions
We are well on our way towards achieving the  
actions outlined in our June 2015 Investor Update.
Capturing value from our international network
In June 2015, we outlined a series  
of strategic actions to make the most 
of our competitive advantages and 
respond to a changing environment.
These actions are focused on 
improving efficiency in how we use 
our resources, and on investing for 
growth in line with our strategy. Each 
action has targets defined to the end 
of 2017. The table opposite contains a 
summary of our progress in 2016 with 
additional details provided below.
Resizing and simplifying  
our business
We have made significant progress in 
resizing and simplifying our business. 
In 2016, management actions reduced 
RWAs in GB&M and legacy credit by 
$46bn and we completed asset sales 
totalling $10.1bn from our US 
consumer and mortgage lending 
(‘CML’) run-off portfolio.
As part of our initiative to optimise  
our network, we completed the sale 
of HSBC Bank Brazil on 1 July 2016. 
We will continue to serve the 
international and cross-border  
needs of our large corporate clients  
in Brazil through HSBC Brasil S.A. – 
Banco de Investimento.
In the NAFTA region, we grew 
adjusted revenue in Mexico by 18% 
compared with 2015, supported by 
market share gains in RBWM across 
key lending products and a doubling 
of personal loans issued. In the US, 
we grew adjusted revenue in GB&M 
and RBWM compared with 2015  
and continued to support our clients 
internationally. Revenues from 
international subsidiaries of our  
US clients increased by 11% 
compared with 2015.
We have made good progress in our 
cost-saving programme and are on 
track to exceed our exit rate target  
set for the end of 2017. We expect  
to achieve total cost savings of $6.0bn 
through one-off investments (‘costs  
to achieve’) of $6.0bn. The additional 
savings will fund increased costs  
related to regulatory programmes  
and compliance. In 2016, operating 
expenses fell by 4% on an adjusted 
basis compared with 2015, facilitated  
by increased efficiency in our processes. 
For example, we launched a new 
customer-facing digital portal to 
standardise and accelerate the 
onboarding process in 26 markets 
covering more than 70% of CMB 
corporate clients, and we decreased the 
number of manual payments by 80%.
Redeploying capital to grow  
our business
At the heart of our business is our 
international network. We are focusing 
efforts to grow our businesses by 
looking at customers’ needs across 
products, geographies and supply 
chains. In 2016, revenue from 
transaction banking products was up 
2% despite difficult macroeconomic 
conditions. We grew revenues in our 
Global Liquidity and Cash Management 
(GLCM) business. In 2016, we were 
named ‘Best Bank for Corporates’ by 
Euromoney and ‘Best Supply-Chain 
Finance Bank Global’ by the Trade  
Finance Awards.
We continue to invest for growth in 
Asia. In December, we launched our 
own HSBC-branded credit cards in 
mainland China with a full range of 
digital features. We increased the 
number of new RBWM clients in China’s 
Pearl River Delta by 51% compared  
with 2015, and grew our mortgage  
loan books by more than 51%. We grew 
revenues from international subsidiaries 
of our ASEAN-region commercial 
banking clients, and in Singapore  
our innovation lab is developing 
cloud-based treasury services for 
businesses and exploring blockchain 
technology to support documentary 
trade transactions. 
We remain recognised as the leading 
bank for international renminbi (‘RMB’) 
products and services. We were the first 
bank to facilitate overseas institutional 
investment into the China interbank bond 
market since access was expanded in 
early 2016. We were also the first to be 
appointed custodian bank in the two 
newly active RMB qualified foreign 
institutional investor (‘RQFII’) markets  
of the US and Thailand this year.
Finally, we continue to strengthen  
our efforts to protect customers  
and the wider financial system from 
financial crime. In 2016, this included 
further upgrades to our systems, as  
well as additional training for our 
employees. Further detail can be found 
under the Financial Crime Risk section 
of www.hsbc.com/financial-crime-risk.

Strategic Report
Financial overview
Reported results
This table shows our reported results for 
the last three years, ended 31 December 
2016, 2015 and 2014.
Reported profit before tax 
Reported profit before tax of $7.1bn  
was $11.8bn or 62% lower than in  
2015. This was primarily due to net 
adverse movements relating to 
significant items and the unfavourable 
effects of foreign currency translation, 
which are described in more detail on 
page 30. Excluding significant items  
and currency translation, profit before 
tax fell by $0.2bn. 
Reported revenue
Reported revenue of $48.0bn was 
$11.8bn or 20% lower than in 2015,  
in part due to a net unfavourable 
movement in significant items of  
$7.6bn, which included:
 – adverse fair value movements of  
$1.8bn arising from changes in credit 
spreads on our own debt designated  
at fair value, compared with favourable 
movements of $1.0bn in 2015; 
 – a $3.6bn reduction in revenue resulting 
from our sale of operations in Brazil to 
Banco Bradesco S.A., which includes  
a $1.7bn accounting loss recognised  
on the sale; and
 – the non-recurrence of a $1.4bn gain on 
the sale of part of our shareholding in 
Industrial Bank Co. Limited (‘Industrial 
Bank’) in 2015; partly offset by
 – a $0.6bn gain on the disposal of our 
membership interest in Visa Europe  
in the second quarter of 2016 and  
a $0.1bn gain on disposal of our 
membership interest in Visa US  
in the fourth quarter of 2016.
In addition, foreign currency translation 
differences between the periods had  
an adverse effect of $3.0bn. 
These factors contributed to a fall  
in reported revenue in all our global

Excluding significant items and the 
adverse effects of foreign currency

 – costs to achieve of $3.1bn compared 
with $0.9bn in 2015; partly offset by
 – a reduction of $1.0bn in settlements 
and provisions in connection with  
legal matters.
Reported LICs
Reported LICs of $3.4bn were  
$0.3bn lower than in 2015 as reductions 
in RBWM and CMB more than offset  
an increase in GB&M. The reduction 
included favourable effects of foreign 
currency translation differences 
between the periods of $0.2bn, and  
the impact of LICs incurred in the 
disposed Brazil operations of $0.7bn 
compared with $0.9bn in 2015.
Reported operating expenses
Reported operating expenses of 
$39.8bn were $40m or 0.1% higher  
than in 2015. This includes favourable 
effects of currency translation 
differences of $2.1bn between  
the periods, and an increase in 
significant items of $3.3bn, including:
 – a $3.2bn write-off of goodwill in  
our GPB business in Europe; and
In addition, the reported results include 
the operating expenses incurred in our 
Brazil business of $1.1bn compared with 
$2.5bn in 2015.
Excluding significant items and the 
adverse effects of foreign currency 
translation differences between the 
periods, operating expenses fell by 
$1.2bn. Reductions in all our global 
businesses reflected the effects of  
our cost-saving initiatives.
Reported income  
from associates
Reported income from associates  
and joint ventures of $2.4bn  
decreased by $0.2bn.
On 21 February 2017, the Board 
announced a fourth interim dividend  
of $0.21 per ordinary share.

To Our Stakeholders
Report of the  Supervisory Board
DEAR SHAREHOLDERS,
We look back on 2020 as an exceptionally challenging year, dominated as it was by 
the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. The year unfolded very differently from the way 
we had anticipated at the end of 2019. Nevertheless, despite the challenging conditions, 
the BMW Group remained focused on its targets and pressed ahead with its future-ori-
ented projects. Thanks to resolute crisis management and rigorous digital teamwork at 
all levels, the BMW Group achieved a respectable result for the year, with deliveries to 
customers in the fourth quarter at their highest level to date. This excellent collective 
performance gives us confidence as we go into 2021. Sustainable, digitalised mobility, 
combined with an outstanding overall customer experience, are the key supporting 
pillars of the BMW Group’s corporate strategy. As a pioneer of new technologies and 
champion of sustainability in economic, social and ecological terms, the BMW Group 
will continue on its transformational journey to becoming a tech company, thereby 
strengthening its position in the premium segment in the process. 
Focus of Supervisory Board activities during the past financial year
The Supervisory Board performed the duties incumbent upon it with the utmost 
diligence in 2020, rigorously monitoring the management of the BMW Group in a 
conscientious manner. It also advised the Board of Management on matters relating 
to the leadership and strategic evolution of the company. In five meetings of the full 
Supervisory Board – all lasting significantly longer than usual due to the circumstances 
and including one two-day meeting – together with the Board of Management we 
deliberated in great detail on the operating performance of the BMW Group. The 
Board of Management also kept the Supervisory Board informed of any matters of 
significance outside the framework of formal meetings as the need arose. In addition, 
the Chairmen of the Supervisory Board and the Board of Management engaged in 
direct dialogue on current issues, as did the Chairman of the Audit Committee and the 
Board of Management member responsible for Finance. Conference calls were also held 
between the Members of the Board of Management, the Board of Management member 
responsible for Finance, the Chairman of the Supervisory Board and the Chairman of 
the Audit Committee as a supplementary measure.
The Board of Management’s regular reports on the Group’s current performance 
were dominated by pandemic-related matters during the year under report. In view 
of the rapid spread of coronavirus in the spring, additional meetings of the Audit 
14
The SUPERVISORY BOARD 
is convinced that the  
BMW Group will continue to 
 expand its position in the 
 premium segment through its 
 enduring commitment to 
 sustainability in economic,  
social and ecological terms.

To Our Stakeholders
Report of the  Supervisory Board
15
Committee and the Presiding Board were scheduled to facilitate the monitoring of 
production, sales and liquidity developments in a prompt manner. The Board of Man-
agement kept us constantly informed regarding the impact of the pandemic on the 
BMW Group’s business performance, providing up-to-date status reports on sales, pro-
duction, liquidity and the Financial Services segment. Information on vehicle deliveries 
to customers was separately analysed by market and model, focusing particularly on the 
electrified variants. The reports also dealt with the competitive situation in general and 
the development of new business and transaction volume as well as the risk situation in 
the Financial Services segment. The Board of Management pointed out deviations from 
the original forecast and presented measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic. It 
also outlined potential developments based on a range of possible scenarios. The size 
of the workforce and the attainment of the decarbonisation targets set out by the EU 
Commission were also a subject of discussion.
Furthermore, the Board of Management provided us with information on a number 
of important current topics, including the opening of the Competence Centre for electric 
drivetrain production in Dingolfing and BMW Brilliance Automotive’s second battery 
centre in China as well as the new communication concept for the futuristic technology 
showcase #NEXT Gen 2020, which was held virtually for the first time. The reports also 
addressed the topics of product quality and the progress of the HERE joint venture. 
The Supervisory Board deliberated in depth on the BMW Group’s evolving corporate 
strategy, which is now clearly focused on the progressive transformation of its drivetrain 
technology towards electric mobility. The Board of Management outlined to us the 
renewed production network strategy, which is based on converting the Munich plant 
to assemble the new vehicle architecture and the planned cluster architecture at the 
BMW Group plant in Hungary. As a core component of the BMW Group’s overarching 
corporate strategy, we also took an in-depth look at the sustainability aspect, which is 
embedded at every stage along the supply chain, the production process and the entire 
life cycle of our products. 
The Supervisory Board also deliberated at length on important issues arising within 
the Board of Management’s various key areas of responsibility. Purchasing, for instance, 
reported on the status of the supply chain and the purchasing strategy regarding raw 
materials for electric mobility. The Board of Management member responsible for Fi-
nance gave a talk on the Group’s financing system, focusing in particular on liquidity 
management and financial market risk management. When reporting on the Financial 
Services segment, the main focus was on strategy as well as business performance and 
the risk situation. We also analysed the BMW Group’s strategic cooperations in great 
detail, particularly the further course of the “Your Now” joint venture strategy and the 
market situation in China. 
In light of the coronavirus pandemic and the accompanying restrictions on events 
involving large numbers of people, in early April we agreed that the 2020 Annual 
General Meeting should be held as a virtual event without the physical presence of 
shareholders.
An important topic for the Supervisory Board in 2020 was the revision of the Board 
of Management’s remuneration system for the financial years 2021 and beyond, in line 
with the new version of the German Corporate Governance Code. After the Personnel 
Committee had completed the initial groundwork, in the third quarter we intensively 
discussed proposals for a new remuneration concept with the help of an independent 
remuneration consultant. On this basis, in December we worked through the details 
of the revised remuneration system, focusing in particular on setting targets for the 
variable remuneration components. The Supervisory Board finally passed a resolution 
approving the new remuneration system, including a standardised service agreement, 
new target remuneration levels and total remuneration caps. 
The Supervisory Board reviewed the structure and level of Board of Management re-
muneration for the financial year 2020, whilst also taking into account the BMW Group’s 
business performance in 2020. The salaries of senior executives and employees within 
Germany as a whole were also taken into account. After analysing comparative studies 
provided by an external remuneration consultant, we concluded that the remuneration 
of Board of Management members is appropriate. Detailed information on the remu-
neration of the Board of Management is provided in the Remuneration Report. 
The change to the system of Board of Management remuneration was also the focus 
of one-on-one discussions between myself and investor representatives concerning 
Supervisory-Board-related issues, including the question of the independence of Su-
pervisory Board members.

The main focus of  
SUPERVISORY BOARD 
WORK was on the continued 
 development of corporate 
 strategy, particularly the 
 expansion of electric mobility.
In the third quarter, the Supervisory Board devoted a great deal of time to exam-
ining the BMW Group’s revised forecast for the period from 2021 to 2026. The Board 
of Management outlined the fundamental changes made to mitigate the impact of 
the coronavirus pandemic compared with the forecast presented one year earlier as 
well as the ambitious long-term targets in the forecast. It also pointed out the higher 
degree of volatility and uncertainty in terms of external framework conditions, whilst 
reiterating the aim of achieving continuous overall growth, particularly in the field of 
electric mobility. After thorough examination, the Supervisory Board approved the 
BMW Group’s long-term corporate plan. 
At the final meeting held in 2020, the Board of Management presented the annual 
budget for corporate development in the financial year 2021 and discussed it in exhaus-
tive detail with the Supervisory Board.
With the advance of digitalisation, data protection and cybersecurity are becoming 
increasingly important issues. For this reason, we requested a report on the current 
status from the Board of Management. 
We also discussed the topic of diversity at considerable length. The Board of Man-
agement reported on the current status of the diversity concepts developed by the 
Group and the target achievement at various levels as well as future targets. As its 
target for the proportion of women on the Board of Management from 1 January 2021 to 
31 December 2025, the Supervisory Board has stipulated that the Board of Management 
should continue to include at least one female member. 
The Supervisory Board’s agenda also included a number of internal issues during 
the year under report. For example, the Supervisory Board updated its rules of pro-
cedure and published them online in accordance with the recommendation of the 
revised German Corporate Governance Code. At the Supervisory Board meeting held 
in March, we also discussed the results of our annual efficiency self-assessment in 
detail. The Supervisory Board has also benefited from advances in digitalisation, a key 
element of our corporate strategy, by setting up a digital boardroom to improve the flow 
of information. Due to coronavirus-related restrictions, beginning in the spring, the 
meetings themselves were held as face-to-face events with digital participation offered 
to enable all members to attend.

We also discussed corporate governance standards at the BMW Group. Based 
on a self-assessment, we concluded that the composition of the Supervisory Board 
at 31 December 2020 was in line with the targets stipulated in the diversity concept, 
the competency profile and other composition targets. We updated the competency 
profile and broadened the definition of the various areas of expertise. An overview 
showing each individual Supervisory Board member’s areas of expertise is provided in 
the Statement of Corporate Governance on our website. 
In December, the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board issued their 
Declaration of Compliance with the German Corporate Governance Code. We will 
comply with the recommendations of the Code as amended on 16 December 2019 
without exception. The wording of the Declaration of Compliance can be found in the 
Statement of Corporate Governance on our website. 
The Supervisory Board took part in a variety of further training measures in 2020. 
In July, for instance, we visited the BMW Autonomous Driving Campus in Unter-
schleißheim near Munich and discussed the topic of automated driving at great length 
through several presentations. The presentation held by an external expert on artificial 
intelligence gave us additional food for thought on the importance of software for 
the future of the automotive industry, which we then explored in greater depth in a 
subsequent discussion. In September, the Supervisory Board attended a workshop on 
drivetrain technology at the BMW and MINI Driving Academy in Maisach near Munich, 
including a driving session. 
No conflicts of interest arose on the part of members of the Supervisory Board 
during the year under report. Significant transactions involving Supervisory Board 
members and / or other related parties as defined by IAS 24, including close relatives 
and intermediary entities, were subject to review on a quarterly basis.
We reviewed the efficiency of our work in the Supervisory Board by completing 
a revised and expanded questionnaire as well as holding supplementary discussions 
with the Chairman. Overall, there is a high degree of satisfaction with the work of 
the Supervisory Board. Cooperation, both within the Supervisory Board itself and 
with the Board of Management, was unanimously assessed as being constructive and 
trusting. However, we intend to discuss suggestions for improving individual aspects 
of cooperation in the new financial year. 
Sustainability is at the heart 
of the BMW Group’s broader 
strategy, encompassing  
all relevant aspects, from the 
 supply chain to production 
and the product life cycle.

Description of Presiding Board activities and committee work 
The Supervisory Board has established a Presiding Board and four committees. The 
chairpersons of these two bodies reported in detail on the work of their committees 
at each subsequent Supervisory Board meeting. You can read more about the duties, 
the composition and the working methods of the Presiding Board and various other 
 Supervisory Board committees in the Statement of Corporate Governance on our website.
Due to the exceptional challenges of the past financial year caused by the corona-
virus pandemic, the Presiding Board and the Audit Committee intensified their work 
in order to fulfil their duties in a suitable manner. Additional meetings were held to 
provide the Presiding Board with prompt information on the current status of sales and 
production and the Audit Committee with information on liquidity and the Financial 
Services business.
The Presiding Board held six meetings and one conference call during the financial 
year 2020. Together with the Board of Management and senior heads of department, we 
prepared the detailed agenda of full Supervisory Board meetings (unless a committee 
was responsible for doing so) and made suggestions for topics to be reported on at 
Supervisory Board meetings. 
The Audit Committee held seven meetings and three conference calls during the 
year under report. 
The meetings held in February and March 2020 focused primarily on preparing 
the Supervisory Board meeting at which the financial statements for the financial year 
2019 were to be discussed and examined. After obtaining the auditor’s Declaration of 
Independence, the Audit Committee recommended to the full Supervisory Board that 
PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft (“PwC”) be proposed 
for election as auditor at the 2020 Annual General Meeting. There were no indications 
of conflicts of interest, grounds for exclusion or lack of independence on the part of 
the auditor. 
The Audit Committee discussed PwC’s fee proposal for audits of the year-end Com-
pany and Group Financial Statements 2020 and the review of the Half-Year Financial 
Report and deemed it appropriate. Following approval by the Annual General Meeting 
held in May 2020, the Audit Committee appointed PwC for the relevant engagements 
and specified audit focus areas. It also approved the scope of non-audit services to be 
provided by PwC and subsequently received regular reports on the relevant matters. 
The quality of the audit was a subject of discussion at the Supervisory Board meetings 
held in February and June. The Board concluded that the audit was of good quality.
The Board of Management presented us with the Sustainable Value Report as well 
as the separate combined non-financial report of BMW AG and the BMW Group for 
the financial year 2019. Moreover, the representatives of PwC presented the findings 
of their review, which had been performed as a “limited assurance” engagement. 
At our meetings we also discussed preparations for the new Integrated Group Report 
and the procedural changes required with regard to reporting and the external audit. 
We decided that the non-financial (Group) statement should again be reviewed by PwC 
in the form of a “limited assurance” engagement.
We also discussed the quarterly statement with the Board of Management prior 
to their publication. Representatives of the external auditors were present when the 
Half-Year Financial Report was discussed at the beginning of August 2020.
The Audit Committee again dealt intensively with the topic of compliance within the 
BMW Group during the year under report. In his regular report, the Chairman of the 
Compliance Committee provided a summary of ongoing compliance-related proceedings 
and presented a raft of measures aimed at promoting the continuous improvement of 
the compliance system. The Head of Corporate Quality also reported on the subject of 
technical compliance. The relevant head of department also presented the Supervisory 
Board a description of tax and customs compliance management. 
Furthermore, the Audit Committee regularly discussed the status of the EU Com-
mission’s investigation into the antitrust allegations connected with the former working 
groups of several German automobile manufacturers and was provided with updates 
from the Board of Management regarding the potential further course of proceedings. 
In relation to proceedings initiated by the German Federal Cartel Office and ter-
minated in 2019 with a fine of € 28 million regarding the purchase of long steel by the 
BMW Group, the Supervisory Board addressed the question of whether it had a duty 
to act on this matter. The Supervisory Board sought counsel from external lawyers in 
order to obtain legal certainty. On the recommendation of the Audit Committee and 
after carefully considering the advantages and disadvantages for the BMW Group, based 
 

--- Page 19 ---
To Our Stakeholders
Report of the  Supervisory Board

on an expert legal opinion and oral explanations, the Supervisory Board decided not 
to assert any claims for damages against current or former members of the Board of 
Management of BMW AG in connection with the fine imposed by the German Federal 
Cartel Office on 21 November 2019.
In addition, the main findings of internal audits conducted by Corporate Audit as 
well as details of advance audit planning were reported to the Audit Committee. We 
discussed the effectiveness of the BMW Group’s current risk profile and risk manage-
ment system on several occasions, including ongoing measures to improve the internal 
control system on a continuous basis. 
The Audit Committee was regularly provided with detailed information regarding 
major legal disputes and proceedings. These included, in particular, an investigation 
initiated in December 2019 by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) into 
possible violations of US securities laws in relation to the reporting of vehicle delivery 
figures in the USA. The case was concluded in September 2020 with a settlement of 
18 million US dollars. 
Our agenda also included considering an audit report relating to the European 
Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR). In this context, the independent auditor 
confirmed the effectiveness of the system currently applied by BMW AG to ensure 
compliance with the regulatory requirements.
The Audit Committee concurred with the decision of the Board of Management 
to raise the Company’s share capital in accordance with Article 4 (5) of the Articles of 
Incorporation (Authorised Capital 2019) by € 822,000 and issue a corresponding number 
of new non-voting bearer shares of preferred stock in conjunction with the Employee 
Share Programme.
The SUPERVISORY BOARD 
and the BOARD OF  
MANAGEMENT will comply 
with the recommendations  
of the German Corporate 
 Governance Code without 
 exception.

Report of the  Supervisory Board

The Personnel Committee focused primarily on the topic of Board of Management 
remuneration. In its five meetings during the year under report, the Personnel Commit-
tee reviewed the appropriateness of the Board of Management’s remuneration for the 
financial year 2019, duly taking the impact of the coronavirus pandemic into account. 
During the second half of the year, the Committee focused on revising the remuneration 
system for Board of Management members. The Personnel Committee also performed 
the groundwork for the full Supervisory Board to appoint a Board of Management 
member responsible for Development and granted approval for members of the Board 
of Management to assume mandates outside the Group in exceptional cases.
The Nomination Committee convened twice during the financial year 2020. Taking 
into account the German Corporate Governance Code (DGCC) and the composition 
requirements adopted by the Supervisory Board, the Nomination Committee addressed 
the issue of potential replacements for shareholder representatives on the Supervisory 
Board in the coming years. 
The Mediation Committee, which is prescribed by law, did not need to convene 
during the financial year 2020.
Composition of the Board of Management 
With effect from 1 July 2020, Klaus Fröhlich retired from his position as Board of 
Management member responsible for Development. We would like to thank Mr Fröhlich 
for his many years of successful and effective work for BMW AG and particularly wish 
to express our appreciation for the momentum he generated over a 30-year period in 
advancing the BMW Group’s role as a pioneer of new technologies.
The Supervisory Board appointed Frank Weber to the Board of Management as his 
successor with effect from 1 July 2020. Mr Weber joined the BMW Group in 2011 as 
Head of Total Vehicle Development and was most recently responsible for the Rolls-
Royce product line as well as the BMW luxury class. In light of the various management 
positions he has previously held in development, Mr Weber is excellently qualified to 
assume responsibility for Development at the BMW Group and we certainly wish him 
all the best in his new role. 
The Supervisory Board extended the mandate of one Board of Management member 
during the year under report.
Composition of the Supervisory Board, the Presiding Board and the Supervisory Board’s 
committees 
Prof. Renate Köcher left the Supervisory Board with effect from the end of the 
Annual General Meeting 2020. We would like to thank Prof. Köcher for her many 
years of constructive work and faithful cooperation while serving on the Supervisory 
Board. The Annual General Meeting elected Anke Schäferkordt as a new member of 
the Supervisory Board. Ms Schäferkordt has a wealth of knowledge and experience in 
the field of communication and media, and, in her capacity as an independent financial 
expert, ideally complements the Supervisory Board’s overall composition. The Annual 
General Meeting re-elected me as a member of the Supervisory Board and I was again 
elected Chairman at the subsequent meeting of the Supervisory Board. 
In view of the considerable length of time he has been a member of the Supervi-
sory Board and mindful of the Supervisory Board’s efforts to appoint an independent 
chairperson to the Audit Committee as defined in the German Corporate Governance 
Code, Dr Karl-Ludwig Kley resigned his membership and chairmanship of the Audit 
Committee with effect from the end of the 2020 Annual General Meeting. We wish to 
thank Dr Kley for his many years of knowledgeable and committed leadership of the 
Audit Committee and are delighted that he will continue to contribute his expertise as 
a member of the Supervisory Board. Dr Kurt Bock was subsequently elected as member 
and Chairman of the Audit Committee. Dr Bock has been a member of the Supervisory 
Board since 2018 and, as a former long-serving Chief Financial Officer and Chairman of 
the Board of Executive Directors of BASF SE, has a great deal of expertise in the fields 
of accounting, financial reporting and auditing. An overview of the composition of the 
 in this report and in the separate 
Supervisory Board and its committees is provided both

the curricula vitae of Supervisory Board members.

The Goldman Sachs Business Principles
We constantly strive to anticipate 
the rapidly changing needs of our 
clients and to develop new services 
to meet those needs. 
We know that the world of finance will 
not stand still and that complacency  
can lead to extinction.
We regularly receive confidential 
information as part of our normal 
client relationships. 
To breach a confidence or to use 
confidential information improperly or 
carelessly would be unthinkable.
Our business is highly competitive, 
and we aggressively seek to expand 
our client relationships. 
However, we must always be fair 
competitors and must never denigrate 
other firms.
Integrity and honesty are  
at the heart of our business. 
We expect our people to maintain high 
ethical standards in everything they do, 
both in their work for the firm and in 
their personal lives.
Our clients’ interests  
always come first. 
Our experience shows that if we  
serve our clients well, our own  
success will follow.
Our assets are our people,  
capital and reputation. 
If any of these is ever diminished, the 
last is the most difficult to restore. We 
are dedicated to complying fully with 
the letter and spirit of the laws, rules 
and ethical principles that govern us. 
Our continued success depends upon 
unswerving adherence to this standard.
Our goal is to provide superior 
returns to our shareholders. 
Profitability is critical to achieving 
superior returns, building our capital, 
and attracting and keeping our best 
people. Significant employee stock 
ownership aligns the interests of our 
employees and our shareholders.
We take great pride in the 
professional quality of our work. 
We have an uncompromising 
determination to achieve excellence  
in everything we undertake. Though  
we may be involved in a wide variety 
and heavy volume of activity, we  
would, if it came to a choice, rather  
be best than biggest.
We stress creativity and  
imagination in everything we do. 
While recognizing that the old way may 
still be the best way, we constantly 
strive to find a better solution to a 
client’s problems. We pride ourselves 
on having pioneered many of the 
practices and techniques that have 
become standard in the industry.
We make an unusual effort to  
identify and recruit the very best 
person for every job. 
Although our activities are measured in 
billions of dollars, we select our people 
one by one. In a service business,  
we know that without the best people, 
we cannot be the best firm.
We offer our people the opportunity 
to move ahead more rapidly than is 
possible at most other places. 
Advancement depends on merit and 
we have yet to find the limits to the 
responsibility our best people are able 
to assume. For us to be successful, 
our men and women must reflect the 
diversity of the communities and cultures 
in which we operate. That means 
we must attract, retain and motivate 
people from many backgrounds and 
perspectives. Being diverse is  
not optional; it is what we must be.
We stress teamwork  
in everything we do. 
While individual creativity is always 
encouraged, we have found that team 
effort often produces the best results. 
We have no room for those who put their 
personal interests ahead of the interests 
of the firm and its clients.
The dedication of our people to  
the firm and the intense effort  
they give their jobs are greater  
than one finds in most other 
organizations. 
We think that this is an important  
part of our success.
We consider our size an asset  
that we try hard to preserve. 
We want to be big enough to undertake 
the largest project that any of our clients 
could contemplate, yet small enough to 
maintain the loyalty, the intimacy and the 
esprit de corps that we all treasure and 
that contribute greatly to our success.

Fellow Shareholders:
This past year for the global economy may be best described 
as one of incremental, but noticeable improvement. In the 
United States, the economic recovery ﬁnally began to take 
hold with continued underlying economic growth and slowly 
accelerating gains in the labor market. In Europe, while 
conditions remained broadly difﬁcult, we began to see nascent 
growth and, in certain countries, such as the United Kingdom, 
a more advanced recovery.
Fears of a sharp slowdown in China receded somewhat  
and the country’s new leadership signaled a more assertive 
posture on economic and ﬁnancial reform. In Japan, aggressive 
ﬁscal and monetary policies spurred a reinvigorated economic 
and ﬁnancial environment.
At the same time, political impasse in the United States for 
much of the year and uncertainty over central bank policy 
both highlighted and, to some extent, contributed to the 
fragility of the economic recovery. As a result, many of our 
clients remained cautious, which hindered a broad-based 
resumption of their business activities.
Amidst these shifting factors, we are pleased to report  
that Goldman Sachs performed relatively well, generating  
solid results for the year. This was the by-product of our 
commitment to a core set of businesses and actions we

In front of Julie Mehretu’s 
MURAL at 200 West Street
have taken over the last several years in three important 
areas: strengthening our balance sheet, allocating capital 
efﬁciently across our businesses and managing our 
costs prudently.
For 2013, the ﬁrm produced net revenues of $34.2 billion  
and net earnings of $8.0 billion, an eight percent increase 
from $7.5 billion of net earnings in 2012. Diluted earnings per 
common share were $15.46 compared with $14.13 for 2012. 
Our return on average common shareholders’ equity (ROE) 
was 11.0 percent. Book value per common share increased by 
approximately ﬁve percent during 2013 and has grown from 
$20.94 at the end of our ﬁrst year as a public company in 1999 
to $152.48, a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 
15 percent over this period. Our capital management in 2013 
reﬂected a prudent approach as our capital ratios continued  
to improve despite returning $7.2 billion to common 
shareholders through share buybacks and dividends.
In this year’s letter, we would like to review the signiﬁcant 
steps we have taken in recent years to adapt and respond to 
the post-ﬁnancial crisis world, and, building on those efforts, 
our priorities for enhancing returns to our shareholders going 
forward. In that vein, we also will discuss our competitive 
position across our major businesses. Lastly, we want to 
share with you some of the initiatives we undertook related 
to our people, culture and business standards and practices.

Letter to Shareholders
Adapting and Positioning the Firm
The past year marked the ﬁve-year anniversary of the global ﬁnancial crisis.  
Later in the letter, we will discuss the impact of the changes we have made  
from the extensive review of our business standards and practices. Importantly, 
this is also an opportune time to highlight the signiﬁcant actions the ﬁrm has  
taken over the last ﬁve years related to our capital, liquidity and overall ﬁnancial 
proﬁle to adapt to the realities of the operating and, more speciﬁcally, regulatory 
environment. Some of those actions are represented to the right.
We have focused not only on strengthening our balance sheet, but also on ensuring 
that we are allocating capital efﬁciently both to meet the needs of our clients and 
to generate stronger returns going forward.
New regulation is pushing the industry to be even more sensitive to risk-adjusted 
returns, whether through higher capital requirements or the application of stress 
tests. Over time, this may translate into greater pricing discipline across the entire 
industry, which we view as a positive development.
Well in advance of any regulations being ﬁnalized, we have been focused on 
developing and implementing tools to help us better price the provision of liquidity 
to the marketplace, and better manage our capital usage. In that regard, at the 
conclusion of 2013, our estimated transitional Basel III Advanced Common Equity 
Tier 1 ratio was in excess of 11 percent.
Another important capital management effort that we have undertaken is reﬁning 
our business mix in light of new capital requirements. Certain businesses, like the 
Americas reinsurance and European insurance businesses, no longer generated 
attractive returns under a Basel III framework and, as a result, we opted to sell  
a majority stake in them.
Even with investments, such as the longstanding one that Goldman Sachs had in 
Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Limited (ICBC), which was both strategic 
and ﬁnancial, we elected to make adjustments given the new capital requirements. 
Collectively, ICBC and our insurance businesses used approximately 125 basis 
points of the Basel III Advanced Common Equity Tier 1 ratio and consumed  
$40 billion of balance sheet.
Shareholder Returns
As a ﬁrm, we have a long track record of delivering superior returns to our 
shareholders over the cycle. We demonstrated this before the ﬁnancial crisis, during 
it and after. If you look at our average ROE since the onset of the ﬁnancial crisis  
in 2007, we have outperformed each of our U.S. competitors, having produced an 
average ROE during this period of more than four times the peer average.
Nevertheless, while we have generated solid returns in the last ﬁve years, they 
fall below our aspirations. We are committed to improving them notwithstanding

While these are three larger, public examples, we continue to make risk-adjusted 
return decisions across the ﬁrm every day.

the challenges presented in the current environment. At the 
same time, we want to protect our ability to provide signiﬁcant 
upside to shareholders as the economic cycle turns.
By focusing on revenues, expenses and capital efﬁciency,  
we are building near-term beneﬁts, but also driving material 
operating leverage into our business.
Our performance over the last few years is an important 
example of the ﬁrm’s ability to proactively manage a cyclical 
business and to capitalize on creating operating leverage  
in our business model. In 2011, we announced an initial  
$1.2 billion expense savings initiative, the size of which was 
subsequently increased twice, ultimately reaching a run-rate 
of $1.9 billion. In 2012, a 19 percent increase in net revenues 
translated into an 82 percent increase in pre-tax earnings and 
a ROE expansion to 10.7 percent. In 2013, despite essentially 
unchanged net revenues, our continued focus on expenses 
enabled us to grow pre-tax earnings by ﬁve percent and 
expand ROE to 11.0 percent. Longer term, we expect that  
a more robust environment will enable us to deliver even 
more operating leverage to our shareholders.
With respect to capital management, our strong capital 
generation and balance sheet management have allowed us to 
grow our Basel III ratio while returning capital to shareholders. 
Since year-end 2010, we have repurchased approximately 
$17 billion of our shares, and reduced our basic share count 
by approximately 80 million shares or 15 percent, while our 
U.S. peers, taken together, actually showed an average 
increase in share count. Our approach drives shareholder 
value through both higher returns and growth in earnings  
per common share.
Controlling Costs
In addition to effective capital management, we are acutely 
focused on expense management as a lever for driving 
incremental shareholder returns. From 2009 through 2013, 
our average compensation and beneﬁts expense to net 
revenues ratio was approximately 880 basis points lower  
than the average ratio from 2000 to 2007.
Compensation and beneﬁts is our largest expense and we 
remain committed to paying for performance. In lower net 
revenue years, like 2008 and 2011, we demonstrated 
signiﬁcant ﬂexibility in our compensation and beneﬁts 
expense. In years with net revenue growth, this expense 
generally increased at a lower rate than net revenues, thereby 
driving operating leverage and enhancing shareholder returns.
The ﬁrm remains committed to operating efﬁciently for  
our shareholders, while providing world-class service to our 
clients. Of course, maintaining discipline around costs 
requires making tough decisions regarding stafﬁng levels  
and compensation. We have strived to get the balance right, 
between improving shareholder returns and investing in the 
future of our client franchise. To do so, we have leveraged 
technology, adjusted our allocation of resources and managed 
both compensation and non-compensation expenses.
Our expense savings initiatives included enhancements in 
technology and greater geographic diversity in our workforce. 
Currently, we have approximately 8,200 staff, or roughly  
25 percent of our workforce, located in Bangalore, Salt Lake 
City, Dallas and Singapore, compared with 10 percent in 
2007. Additionally, 38 percent of all campus and experienced 
hires since 2011 have been hired into those ofﬁces.
We were among the ﬁrst global banks to embark on  
an expense savings initiative and, although painful, the  
exercise was necessary. Being an early mover allowed 
ongoing recognition of savings over the past two years and 
protected returns in what continues to be a challenging 
operating environment.
Growth and the State of Our Client Franchise
While we have strengthened our balance sheet, prioritized 
efﬁcient capital allocation and taken a disciplined approach  
to costs, we have continued to invest in a broad set of 
institutionally focused businesses that have a track record  
of providing higher returns than many other businesses within 
ﬁnancial services. Because of a consistent focus on our 
clients’ needs and orienting our businesses to meet their 
ongoing objectives, we believe we have provided solid 
returns in a challenging period, while seeking to protect our 
ability to provide signiﬁcant upside to our shareholders as  
the economic cycle turns.
We believe our businesses are particularly well positioned  
for the time when broad-based growth resumes. And, we  
see reasons to be conﬁdent in the fundamentals of the global 
economy. While emerging markets typically entail higher risk 
and volatility, we believe that over time they will generate 
stronger growth as the middle class in those countries

Letter to Shareholders
expands and consumption and investment trends evolve.  
In developed economies, greater CEO conﬁdence is  
driving more strategic acquisitions as more companies are 
committing to longer term growth plans. Investor sentiment 
has also rebounded, and more companies are taking 
advantage of a better operating environment to raise equity 
and debt. In the U.S., the process of ending quantitative 
easing has begun, and while unsettling for certain markets, 
the move to a more normalized market environment is 
necessary and ultimately reassuring. All of these trends  
play to the strengths and position of our businesses.
Investment Banking
Investment Banking not only includes our advisory and 
ﬁnancing services; it also serves as an important source of 
opportunities for all parts of the ﬁrm. For example, working 
with clients in our ﬁnancing business often drives demand  
for hedging solutions, while our advisory franchise can create 
opportunities for co-investment with our business partners.
We continue to demonstrate outperformance in our advisory 
franchise. In 2013, we ranked ﬁrst in both announced and 
completed global mergers and acquisitions.
Our equity underwriting franchise was equally strong in  
2013, ranking ﬁrst in global equity and equity-related 
offerings, common stock offerings and initial public offerings 
(IPOs). We served as bookrunner on eight of the ten largest 
IPOs for the year. The technology sector was especially active 
and Goldman Sachs was the lead-left bookrunner for nearly 
twice as many technology IPOs in the U.S. than the next 
most active underwriter.
In debt underwriting, we had our best year ever in net 
revenues. While we believe that we could further strengthen 
our league table position, we do not aim to be ranked ﬁrst in 
this business. Despite our natural desire to be ranked at the 
top of any league table, we believe achieving that position,  
in this case, would require a signiﬁcant increase in lending  
at rates that would ultimately dilute long-term returns. Our 
approach could change to the extent that regulatory changes 
drive more attractive pricing.
More broadly, the past year represented one of our  
strongest market share performances in our advisory and 
underwriting franchises since 2000.
Institutional Client Services
In Institutional Client Services, our equities franchise is  
built on the premise of providing a broad suite of services  
to our investing clients. This means having a state-of-the-art 
electronic platform, comprehensive prime brokerage services 
and the capacity to be an effective liquidity provider for  
our clients.
It also means leveraging our global technology platform to 
have a scalable “high touch” and “low touch” approach to 
meeting our clients’ needs. It is not sustainable to have only 
one approach if your goal is to serve a diverse set of clients 
and to produce strong returns. Clients determine how they 
engage the ﬁrm, and they are increasingly looking to transact 
electronically with us in both cash and derivative products.
The long-term demand, however, for product innovation and 
“high touch” services remains. So, our ability to offer unique 
solutions across equities products continues to be critical  
to our clients. This dual approach of “high touch” and  
“low touch” is a by-product of the many market structure  
and regulatory changes in the equity markets over the past  
15 years. Our ability to adjust to a changing regulatory 
environment has been critical to maintaining a leadership 
position within our Equities business.
This is also true in Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities 
Client Execution (FICC). We maintain a leading position  
across a broad range of products and geographies, with  
a focus on being responsive to our clients’ needs. There is 
considerable discussion about the outlook for FICC given  
the numerous regulatory changes taking place and the  
lower client volumes. We remain committed to our FICC 
businesses, which, here again, reﬂects the value our clients 
place on the services that we provide in these markets.  
And, our commitment has allowed our client franchise to 
grow. Over the past three years, for example, the number  
of corporate and growth market relationships have each 
grown by approximately 30 percent.
Some of our competitors may elect to deemphasize or exit 
some FICC businesses, given their particular circumstances. 
But, we believe this is likely to increase the value that clients 
place on the services provided by those who remain, 
especially as broader economic activity rebounds and the 
trading environment improves.

 ”The past year 
represented one of 
our strongest market 
share performances 
in our advisory 
and underwriting 
franchises  
since 2000.” 
For our FICC businesses, providing liquidity to our investing 
clients requires us to take risk, and as a consequence, FICC  
is the largest consumer of our capital. Our commitment to 
these businesses does not mean that we haven’t taken 
signiﬁcant action regarding how we utilize capital. We have 
meaningfully reduced risk-weighted assets in FICC and are 
very focused on managing it for risk-adjusted returns. Chasing 
revenue market share within FICC businesses can lead to  
risk management lapses and inferior returns. Focusing on  
the right balance between risk, revenue and returns has  
been important to building a leading global franchise and 
consistently delivering strong returns for our shareholders.
Investment Management
With total assets under supervision surpassing a record  
trillion dollars, our Investment Management business is  
one of the largest in the world. We have a strong position  
across a diverse set of products spanning all major asset 
classes and geographies. And, despite the challenging market 
environment, we have been able to grow long-term assets 
under supervision by 36 percent since the beginning of 2007.
Additionally, we have expanded our deﬁned contribution 
franchise, with approximately $50 billion in new assets  
from our acquisition of Dwight Asset Management and  
our pending acquisition of Deutsche Bank’s stable  
value business.
Like our other businesses, success in Investment 
Management is a function of performing for our clients.  
Our asset-weighted mutual fund performance has been 
above the industry average for nine consecutive quarters 
through 2013. Two-thirds of our mutual fund assets were 
ranked in the top two quartiles by Morningstar across  
one, three and ﬁve year performance periods.
As performance has improved, so have asset inﬂows.  
We had net sales in long-term assets under supervision  
of $41 billion, the highest since 2007, which were broadly 
distributed across our three key client channels: High-net-
worth individuals, Third-party distributed and Institutional.  
This focus on performance has been a critical component  
in generating our highest net revenues for Investment 
Management since 2007.
Investing & Lending
Investing & Lending includes direct investing, our investing 
through funds, as well as lending to both corporations and 
high-net-worth individuals.
Our investing activity, including co-investing with our clients, 
has established itself as an important complement to our 
other franchise businesses. We have a history of strong 
investment performance over the years, and that reputation, 
along with deep client relationships, have allowed us to  
invest in opportunities that are not available to others.
Our debt investments are driven by senior loan and mezzanine 
investments, and our direct ﬁnancing and lending businesses. 
Our Investing & Lending business includes approximately  
$31 billion of direct loans, primarily extended to corporate 
clients and high-net-worth individuals. Our equity investments 
include private equity funds, direct equity investments and 
hedge fund investments. The “Volcker Rule,” which we will 
discuss in more detail, limits our ability to invest in hedge 
funds and private equity through a fund structure; as such, for 
some time now in anticipation, we have been redeeming our 
hedge fund investments to be compliant. While we’ve been 
actively harvesting our private equity funds, solid asset price 
performance has kept balance sheet levels relatively ﬂat.
Our investing and lending activities are synergistic  
with our other activities and are valuable to our clients.  
We remain committed to these businesses and, now with 
greater regulatory clarity, we know that with the necessary 
adjustments, we will continue to work with our clients  
as an investor.
Regulation
In December, regulators passed the ﬁnal Volcker Rule,  
which restricts banking entities’ proprietary trading activities 
and certain interests in, and relationships with, hedge funds 
and private equity funds.
Goldman Sachs 2013 Annual Report

--- Page 8 ---
Letter to Shareholders
Throughout the rulemaking process, we stated that it was 
critical that the rulemaking proceed in a way that is not 
counterproductive to the ability of companies and investors  
to continue to use the capital markets to accomplish their 
business objectives.
Importantly, the ﬁnal Volcker Rule explicitly permitted market 
making, lending and investing on balance sheet. Regulators 
allowed these activities because ﬁnancial intermediation plays 
an essential role in capital raising and risk management, 
supporting broader economic activity and growth.
As we indicated earlier, while the rule was only recently 
ﬁnalized, we have been preparing to comply with certain 
portions of the rule for nearly three years. We liquidated 
substantially all of our proprietary trading positions, speciﬁcally 
our Principal Strategies and our Global Macro Proprietary 
positions. And in 2012, we announced our intention to  
redeem certain hedge fund investments. Since then, we  
have redeemed approximately $2.2 billion of hedge fund 
investments and we will continue to redeem our interests.
We are now focused on ensuring that we are in the position 
to effectively and efﬁciently comply with the requirements  
of this new and signiﬁcant legal regime.
Our People
The quality and breadth of our client franchise are a direct 
by-product of our ability to attract and retain high-caliber 
professionals. As an investment bank, our main asset is  
our people and the advice and solutions that they provide to 
our clients. Great people build great relationships. And, we 
are fortunate to have a diverse group of young people from 
around the world who continue to view Goldman Sachs as  
a great place to begin and sustain their careers. For our latest 
analyst class, more than 43,000 candidates applied for 1,900 
positions. We accepted about four percent of those applicants 
and of those receiving offers, more than 80 percent accepted.
In 2013, we were proud to be named as one of Fortune 
magazine’s “100 Best Companies to Work For.” Goldman 
Sachs is one of only ﬁve companies to be recognized every 
year that the Great Place to Work Institute has issued its  
list since 1984.
Of course, we operate in a global and competitive industry 
and we seek to attract from the broadest pool of talented

people available. It is incumbent upon us to ensure that  
we are always adapting to the realities of a workplace, 
especially one now shaped by instant connectivity.
This past year, we closely examined the day-to-day work 
environment for junior bankers and its connection to  
long-term career development. After that review, we 
announced a series of initiatives so that these young 
professionals receive more regular feedback and career 
development guidance, more time with their managers and 
clients and more consistent and predictable periods when 
they can plan to be out of the ofﬁce. We also are using new 
technology that will make the process of creating client-
related materials easier. The goal through these initiatives is 
to recognize the difference between untargeted effort and 
productive work. Our measures of success will continue to 
be the quality of thought and work we do for our clients, 
something that is sustainable only in a workplace that 
emphasizes productivity over the expectation of hours in the 
ofﬁce and greater balance in pursuit of a long-term career.
Business Standards & Practices
As we have written to you in the past, we have spent 
enormous time and effort, as a ﬁrm, reviewing and improving 
our business standards and practices. In January 2011, we 
published the Report of the Business Standards Committee 
(BSC), which was the culmination of an extensive eight-
month review encompassing every major business, region 
and activity of the ﬁrm. The report made 39 recommendations 
for change in the above areas.
In January 2011, we established the BSC Implementation 
Oversight Group, which for the next two years was 
responsible for overseeing the implementation of each 
recommendation. By February 2013, all 39 recommendations 
had been fully implemented.

--- Page 9 ---
In May 2013, we released another public report, the Business 
Standards Committee Impact Report, which discussed the 
changes we made as a result of the BSC implementation  
and how they impacted our ﬁrm. We identiﬁed three unifying 
themes across the 39 recommendations, which capture  
the areas of greatest change and impact on the ﬁrm:  
(1) clients, and the higher standard of care we apply in 
serving them; (2) reputational sensitivity and awareness, 
and its importance in everything we do; and (3) the individual 
and collective accountability of our people.
Most signiﬁcantly, for all our employees, the experience of 
initiating, approving and executing a transaction for a client  
at Goldman Sachs is now fundamentally different. This 
difference reﬂects signiﬁcant changes to processes, business 
standards, documentation and transaction approvals, all of 
which impact our approach to decision making.
Process matters and the BSC changes have led to our 
processes being more clear, comprehensive and consistent. 
Business standards reﬂect the heightened scrutiny we bring 
to our own actions and activities, the role we play as a large 
ﬁnancial institution and the responsibilities we have to our 
clients and to global ﬁnancial intermediation. Documentation 
supporting our processes is more standardized and organized 
around escalation procedures. Transaction approvals focus on 
the core goals of serving our clients’ long-term interests and 
protecting the ﬁrm’s reputation. Taken together, these changes 
result in better judgments and decision making, which are 
among the most important impacts emerging from the BSC.
The work underlying the BSC is part of a much larger,  
ongoing commitment by the ﬁrm to be self-aware, to be  
open to change and to learn the right lessons from recent 
experiences. Going forward, we know we will inevitably 
make mistakes, but we commit to learn from them and 
respond in a way that meets the high expectations of our 
clients, shareholders, other stakeholders, regulators and  
the broader public.
On our Web site, in addition to the two reports, you can  
view other relevant material, including a discussion on the 
impact of the Client and Business Standards Committee,  
an illustrated example of the life cycle of a client transaction  
and video excerpts from the Chairman’s Forum, which was  
a series of internal discussions led by senior management  
on how we conduct ourselves in serving our clients and 
protecting the ﬁrm’s reputation.
Corporate Engagement
In 2013, Goldman Sachs committed more than $200 million  
to philanthropic endeavors, including our tradition of strong 
engagement through Goldman Sachs Gives and expanding 
10,000 Women and 10,000 Small Businesses to include  
new academic and non-proﬁt partners.
Goldman Sachs Gives
Goldman Sachs Gives is a donor-advised fund through  
which participating managing directors (PMDs) of the ﬁrm  
can recommend grants to qualiﬁed non-proﬁt organizations 
around the world. Since the inception of Goldman Sachs Gives, 
PMD compensation has been reduced by approximately  
$1.2 billion to fund Goldman Sachs Gives, and approximately 
15,000 grants totaling more than $720 million have been 
made to various organizations in 38 countries. Since the fund 
was created, more than $350 million has been granted to 
community organizations supporting veterans, poverty 
alleviation, medical research and other signiﬁcant areas of 
need. In addition, more than $145 million has been granted  
to approximately 180 colleges and universities to support 
ﬁnancial aid. In 2013, more generally, approximately  
$150 million was distributed through more than 4,500 
individual grants.
10,000 Small Businesses
10,000 Small Businesses expanded its network of cities and 
partners to provide small businesses with the education, 
business services and capital they need to grow and create 
jobs. By year’s end, 10,000 Small Businesses was operating  
in more than 20 sites in the U.S. and United Kingdom. In the 
U.S., we launched new sites in Philadelphia, Miami and 
Detroit. In addition, loans through the program began to be 
offered in Oregon, Washington, Tennessee, Virginia and 
Maine. In the fall, we announced a new national partnership 
that allows qualiﬁed small business owners anywhere in the 
U.S. to receive training at Babson College, one of the nation’s 
leading entrepreneurial schools.
In the United Kingdom, we hosted the ﬁrst gathering of 
10,000 Small Businesses alumni from across the country, 
with more than 200 businesses attending. In conjunction  
with the event, academic program partners released a 
progress report on the graduating businesses to date 
showing that 66 percent of U.K. program participants had 
grown revenue and 77 percent of them had created jobs.

risks in Europe and the political impasse in Washington, D.C. 
appear less likely than a year ago. Collectively, we have made 
a lot of progress.
Of course, concerns about emerging economies, the effect  
of the Federal Reserve’s “taper,” and a host of other issues 
may challenge sentiment and complicate the recovery. As  
we look at the longer term fundamentals, however, we 
remain optimistic.
For Goldman Sachs, our businesses are well positioned  
and our client franchise is strong. We have taken important 
actions to manage efﬁciently our capital and cost structure. 
As a result, we are conﬁdent that we have achieved 
signiﬁcant operating leverage for our shareholders, which  
will become only clearer with an improving economic 
environment. Our culture of teamwork and client focus  
has never been more alive and vibrant and continues to 
deﬁne who we are and the work we do. We remain intent  
on learning from the experience of recent years but maintain  
a ﬁrm eye on the future to do our part to contribute to 
economic growth and opportunity. In the process, we  
are conﬁdent that Goldman Sachs will produce signiﬁcant  
value for our shareholders.

10,000 Women
2013 represented an important milestone for our 10,000 
Women initiative. In December, the 10,000th woman entered 
the program and is expected to graduate in 2014. Since it 
was announced in 2008, this program has provided 10,000 
underserved women entrepreneurs with a business and 
management education, access to mentors and networks, 
and links to capital. 10,000 Women has drawn participants 
from more than 40 countries around the world. Delivered 
through a network of 90 academic and non-proﬁt partners, 
10,000 Women continues to yield promising results. More 
than 80 percent of surveyed graduates have increased 
revenues and more than 70 percent have added new jobs.
We are focused on the next chapter of 10,000 Women  
and recently announced a new partnership with the 
International Finance Corporation (IFC), a member of the 
World Bank Group, to create the ﬁrst-ever global ﬁnance 
facility dedicated exclusively to women-owned small and 
medium enterprises. Goldman Sachs Foundation, IFC and 
other investors will contribute up to $600 million to the 
facility, which will enable approximately 100,000 women 
entrepreneurs to access capital. 10,000 Women remains 
committed to expanding business and management 
education to reach more high-potential women entrepreneurs 
around the world. Through the capital this partnership will 
raise, women entrepreneurs will have a much greater  
chance of reaching their full potential.
Looking Ahead
In our shareholder letter to you for 2006, we wrote that  
“we are always cognizant that conditions can change quickly 
and in unforeseen ways…One of the worst things we could 
do, as a ﬁrm and as individuals, is to begin to believe that the 
laws of economics do not apply to us — that somehow 
markets aren’t cyclical.”
Much of the last ﬁve years has been challenged by the cyclical 
downturn. We believe that the upcoming year may very well 
represent the progression into a stronger global economy. 
But, this has not been a passive exercise. The banking sector, 
especially in the U.S., is well capitalized; companies are 
operating with strong balance sheets; new ways to tap 
sources of energy are making U.S. manufacturing more 
competitive; the housing market is recovering and individuals 
have signiﬁcantly reduced their debt. In addition, the tail

7   RepoRt  of the SupeRviSoRy BoaRd
Dear Shareholders and Shareholder Representatives,
The BMW Group has again fared extremely well over the past financial year. Throughout the twelve-
month period, we diligently supervised the Board of Management’s running of the business and, in joint 
consultations, supported it in an advisory capacity. Our work within the Supervisory Board and in con-
junction with the Board of Management was conducted openly, constructively and in a spirit of trust.
Main emphases of the Supervisory Board’s monitoring and advisory activities  In a total of five meet-
ings, we deliberated on the BMW Group’s current situation. Other matters at the forefront of our consulta-
tions were corporate strategy and planning for the BMW Group as a whole, the strategy being pursued for the 
Financial Services segment in particular, risk management and levels of risk provision. Decisions were also 
taken with respect to the composition and compensation of the Board of Management and an examination 
of corporate governance within the enterprise was carried out. In 2013 we paid particular attention to the 
progress being made in the field of electromobility and to the efforts expended and the challenges arising for 
the BMW Group regarding the necessity to continue to reduce emissions.
We carefully monitored the performance of the BMW Group and were regularly kept informed of sales 
performance, workforce developments and other significant matters, both at scheduled meetings and at 
other times as the need arose. Moreover, the Chairman of the Board of Management, Dr Reithofer, informed 
me directly about major business transactions and projects. In addition to scheduled meetings, Dr Kley, the 
Chairman of the Supervisory Board’s Audit Committee, and Dr Eichiner, the Board of Management member 
responsible for Finance and Financial Reporting, remained in direct contact at other times.
In its regular reports on the financial condition of the Group, the Board of Management presented its 
 assessment of economic developments in important regions of the world, commented on sales volume and 
competitive issues within the Automotive and Motorcycles segments and highlighted fluctuations in the 
size of the workforce. We were also kept informed of the performance of the Financial Services segment, 
 including new retail business volumes, the size of the contract portfolio with dealers and retail customers, 
total business volume and the development of vehicle residual values on major markets.
The business status reports provided by the Board of Management also dealt with important ongoing 
 activities and projects, such as the current status of the realigned strategy adopted for BMW Motorrad as well 
as the progress of cooperation discussions and projects with Toyota. The Supervisory Board was also informed 
of any temporary delays affecting spare parts supplies during the summer and deliberated on causes and 
countermeasures required.
One of the Supervisory Board meetings was held at the BMW site in Berlin, where we visited BMW Motorrad’s 
production facilities. The Board of Management and local management representatives took this opportunity 
to present their vision of the new strategic direction of the motorcycle line of business, with its focus on the 
premium segment. As well as receiving an insight into new product concepts, we were also informed of the 
range of measures currently being implemented in the fields of production, sales and marketing, aimed at 
 attracting new motorcycle customer groups and making inroads on emerging markets with appropriate 
products.
We looked at the regulatory situation on the world’s major markets, particularly in the EU, China, USA and 
Japan, both for vehicles powered by combustion engines and those with alternative drive systems. The Board 
of Management elucidated numerous options for achieving further reductions in carbon emission levels for 
conventional vehicles and the genuine benefits that can be generated by expanding electromobility products

and services in various markets. Future emission targets currently being mulled over by policymakers, the 
various proposals put forward in this context and their likely impact on the BMW Group as a premium manu-
facturer and on the competitive situation were also discussed with the Board of Management.
We devoted considerable time to deliberating on the expectations and needs of customers with respect to 
electric mobility. In this context, we gave careful consideration to the production and marketing concepts for 
the BMW i3, including complementary services and measures, such as the BMW Battery Certificate or Range 
Extender, both of which have been developed to meet specific customer requirements.
At one two-day meeting of the Supervisory Board, corporate and product strategies were considered, the 
Long-term Business Forecast examined and time set aside for a detailed look at a range of salient technical 
and marketing topics.
During the first part of the meeting we again discussed with the Board of Management the findings of 
its annual review of the Group’s Strategy Number ONE, including various potential risk scenarios. The 
Board of Management reported on the distribution of sales volume and added value, focusing in particular 
on the latest status of projects in China and on plans for building further production sites in Brazil, Russia 
and the NAFTA region.
In conjunction with vehicle presentations, Supervisory Board members also had the opportunity to 
test-drive a number of BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce vehicles, including the BMW i3 and BMW i8. Presenta-
tions were also made by senior department heads on selected marketing and technical topics related to 
 electromobility.
After concluding the Annual Strategy Review, the second part of the meeting included an in-depth dis-
cussion of the long-term business forecast drawn up by the Board of Management for the years from 2014 to 
2019 and, after thorough examination and deliberation, we gave the required approval. We remain firm in 
our conviction that the strategic direction set by the Board of Management for the BMW Group is robust and 
sustainable.
The Board of Management reported to us on the performance and strategy of the Financial Services 
segment, explaining the principal aspects of its internal management and organisation. We deliberated on 
the role the segment plays within the Group, including a discussion of the impact of increasing regulation 
in the financial sector.
We also thoroughly examined the Annual Budget for the financial year 2014, which was presented by the 
Board of Management in November 2013. We fully support the focus being placed on growth and quality of 
earnings.
We were also briefed in detail by the Board of Management on the results of regional customer surveys 
 relating to product quality, the perception of quality and the acceptance of concepts. The assurance and 
 improvement of quality processes and measures were explained to us and we were also afforded an interest-
ing insight into regional and cultural differences in customer expectations. In all cases, the Board of Manage-
ment emphasised its aspiration to maintain the highest level of quality.
The Supervisory Board and the Board of Management jointly addressed the topic of corporate governance 
within the BMW Group on several occasions in 2013. Following the amendment to the variable component 
of Supervisory Board compensation by the Annual General Meeting in May 2013, the remuneration structure 

--- Page 9 ---
9   RepoRt  of the SupeRviSoRy BoaRd
now complies with all relevant recommendations of the German Government Corporate Governance Code 
Commission. In the most recent Declaration of Compliance, which was issued in December 2013, the 
Board of Management and the Supervisory Board resolved that the BMW Group should comply with the 
recommendations of the German Government Corporate Governance Code Commission published on 
15 June 2013 (Code version; 15 May 2013), without exception and with effect from the applicable date.
Again in 2013, in both the Personnel Committee and the full Supervisory Board we examined both the 
structure and the amount of the compensation that Board of Management members receive. In order to vali-
date the suitability of the system and the appropriateness of results, we reviewed the comparable trends for 
business performance and Board of Management compensation on a multi-year basis. We also gave general 
consideration to the development of the remuneration of executive managers and employees of BMW AG 
within Germany over the course of time. Moreover, we sought the expertise of an external compensation 
consultant, independent of both Company and Board of Management, and evaluated compensation studies 
for the DAX. To accommodate the desire for a consistent remuneration model throughout the Group, the 
Personnel Committee also made enquiries into the structure of management remuneration and the status 
of any planned changes to that structure. Relevant points were discussed by the full Supervisory Board, 
where, after deliberation, it was decided that a fundamental change to the Board of Management compensa-
tion system is not required.
Pension entitlements were also reviewed. Based on a proposal put forward by the Personnel Committee, 
and after discussion with an independent compensation consultant, with effect from the financial year 
2013 we resolved to increase the extent to which contributions for Board of Management members are stag-
gered. Future calculations will be based on the length of service on the board as well as previous activities 
and individual amounts will be increased to take account of benchmark developments in the DAX. For these 
purposes, we considered the estimated impact on compensation as a whole and on the probable future level 
of pensions.
In the course of implementing the recommendations of the German Government Corporate Governance 
Code Commission, we set caps for the individual components and the total amount of compensation for 
Board of Management members with effect from the financial year 2014. The target compensation levels for 
Board of Management members remain unchanged. The employment contracts of current Board of Manage-
ment members were amended, with the agreement of those members, with effect from 1 January 2014. 
 Detailed information with respect to Board of Management compensation, including a summary of remunera-
tion caps, is shown in the Compensation Report.
In conjunction with the joint examination of corporate governance, the Board of Management informed 
us (both in the Personnel Committee and in the full Supervisory Board) on the status of implementation of 
the diversity concept throughout the BMW Group, a concept which is not merely restricted to a focus on gen-
der, but which is aimed at promoting diversity in other areas, particularly in terms of cultural diversity and 
the international character of the workforce. In this context, the Board of Management informed us regarding 
the percentage of women occupying management positions and changes thereto, in particular at senior 
management level and executive level below the Board of Management, as well as the planned measures to 
increase this percentage.
With regard to its own composition, based on a detailed composition profile, the Supervisory Board 
decided upon specific appointment goals in 2010, which are discussed in detail in the Corporate Governance 
Report. These appointment goals were not changed in 2013. No conflicts of interest arose during the year 
under report on the part of members of either of the boards. Significant transactions with Supervisory 

--- Page 10 ---

Board members and other related parties as defined by IAS 24, including close relatives and intermediary 
entities, are examined on a quarterly basis.
We endeavour to assess and continuously improve the efficiency of the work performed by the Super visory 
Board and its committees. The Chairman of the Audit Committee and myself are therefore always glad to 
 receive comments and suggestions for improvement from Supervisory Board members. The formal examina-
tion of the Supervisory Board’s efficiency is also treated once each year as a separate agenda point for dis-
cussion, for which preparations are made with the aid of a questionnaire.
Each of the five Supervisory Board meetings in 2013 was attended on average by over 95 % of its mem-
bers, a fact that can be tied in to the analysis of attendance fees for individual members, as disclosed in 
the Compensation Report. No member of the Supervisory Board was absent at more than two meetings 
during their period of office. Presiding Board and committee meetings were fully attended in the vast 
 majority of cases.
Description of Presiding Board activities and committee work  In order to work more efficiently and 
prepare complex issues and decisions with greater thoroughness, the Supervisory Board has established a 
Presiding Board and several committees. A description of the duties, composition and work procedures of 
these committees is provided in the Corporate Governance Report.
The relevant committee chairpersons provided timely and comprehensive accounts of the work of the 
Presiding Board and committees and I personally brought the representatives of the shareholders up to date 
about the work of the Nomination Committee.
In a total of four meetings, the Presiding Board focused mainly on preparing topics for the meetings of 
the full Supervisory Board, unless this fell under the remit of one of the committees. Complex issues, such as 
the Long-term Business Forecast and the Annual Strategic Review, were dealt with on the basis of written 
and oral reports provided by Board of Management members and senior department heads. The Head of 
Financial Services, for instance, reported to us on segment strategy, business developments, credit risks 
and leasing vehicle residual value risks as well as providing us with detailed information on the current status 
of various strategic projects. The Presiding Board selected further topics of discussion for Supervisory Board 
meetings and made suggestions to the Board of Management regarding items to be included in its reports to 
the full Supervisory Board.
The Audit Committee held four meetings and three telephone conference calls during 2013. The Interim 
Financial Reports were discussed with the Board of Management in those telephone conference calls, prior 
to their publication. Representatives of the external auditors were present during the telephone conference 
call held to present the Interim Financial Report for the six-month period ended 30 June 2013. The report 
had been subjected to review by the external auditors.
The Audit Committee meeting held in spring 2013 was primarily dedicated to preparing the Supervisory 
Board meeting at which the financial statements were examined. Prior to proposing KPMG AG Wirt schafts-
prüfungs gesellschaft for election as Company and Group auditor at the 2013 Annual General Meeting, we 
obtained a Declaration of Independence from KPMG.
The Audit Committee also considered the scope and composition of non-audit services, including tax 
advisory services provided by KPMG entities to the BMW Group. There were no indications of conflicts of 
interest, grounds for exclusion or lack of independence on the part of the auditor.

The fee proposals for the audit of the year-end Company and Group Financial Statements 2013 and the 
 review of the six-month Interim Financial Report were deemed appropriate by the Audit Committee. Sub-
sequent to the Annual General Meeting 2013, the Audit Committee therefore appointed KPMG AG for the 
relevant engagements and, with due consideration to the suggestions made by the full Supervisory Board, 
specified audit focus areas, which, in 2013, included the measurement of warranty and pension provisions 
as well as the recognition of development costs incurred in conjunction with cooperation agreements.
The Head of Group Financial Reporting reported to the Audit Committee on risk management processes 
in place throughout the BMW Group, including an in-depth description of the internal control system (ICS) 
underlying financial reporting. The procedures for determining the degree of maturity of a unit’s ICS were ex-
plained on an illustrative basis for a plant, a sales company and a financial services company.
The Chairman of the BMW Group Compliance Committee reported to the Audit Committee on the cur-
rent compliance situation, which, as in the previous year, was deemed satisfactory overall. None of the in-
formation received relating to potential non-compliance or actual incidences of non-compliance identified in 
specific cases give any indication of serious or systematic non-compliance with applicable requirements.
The Head of Group Internal Audit reported to us in the Audit Committee on the significant findings of 
audits conducted by Group Internal Audit, on both the industrial and financial services sides of the business, 
and put forward suggested recommendations for improvement.
We concurred in the Audit Committee with the decision of the Board of Management to raise the Com-
pany’s share capital in accordance with § 4 (5) of the Articles of Incorporation (Authorised Capital 2009) by 
€265,570 and to issue a corresponding number of new non-voting bearer shares of preferred stock, each with 
a par value of € 1, at favourable conditions to employees.
The Personnel Committee convened four times during the financial year 2013.
In preparation of the full Supervisory Board’s meetings, we reviewed the structure and appropriateness 
of Board of Management compensation, including pension entitlements. We also worked on proposals to 
 increase the extent to which pension contributions for Board of Management members are staggered and to 
implement the latest recommendations of the German Government Corporate Governance Code Commis-
sion relating to compensation and / or changes in employment contracts. In one case, we also gave our approval 
for a member of the Board of Management to accept the mandate for membership of the supervisory board 
of a non-BMW Group entity.
The Nomination Committee convened twice during the financial year 2013. At these meetings, we de-
liberated on medium and long-term successor planning for the shareholders’ representatives on the Super-
visory Board and considered proposals for candidates for the Supervisory Board elections at the 2013 and 
2014 Annual General Meetings, taking the composition objectives stipulated for the Supervisory Board into 
due account.
The statutory Mediation Committee (§ 27 (3)) of the Law on Worker Participation) was not required to be 
convened during the financial year 2013.
Composition and organisation of the Board of Management  It was with much regret, but also with a great 
deal of respect and understanding, that we accepted the decision taken by Frank-Peter Arndt to step down 
from his position as Board of Management member responsible for Production with effect from 31 March 2013 

--- Page 12 ---
12
for reasons of health. We expressed our deep appreciation to Mr Arndt for his many years of committed and 
conscientious service and for the personal contribution he made to the success of the BMW Group. Details of 
the arrangements put in place for Mr Arndt following the termination of his board activities are provided in 
the Compensation Report.
In conjunction with a reassignment of responsibilities within the Board of Management with effect from 
1 April 2013, responsibility for Production was entrusted to Harald Krüger, who had been in charge of the 
MINI, BMW Motorrad, Rolls-Royce and BMW Group Aftersales division since its creation in 2012. With effect 
from 1 April 2013, the Supervisory Board appointed Peter Schwarzenbauer as member of the Board of Manage-
ment. With many years of management experience in the premium segment of the automobile industry 
 behind him, Mr Schwarzenbauer took over responsibility for the MINI, BMW Motorrad, Rolls-Royce, After-
sales BMW Group division from Mr Krüger as part of the reallocation of responsibilities within the Board 
of Management. The appointment of one member of the Board of Management was renewed by the Super-
visory Board.
Composition of the Supervisory Board, the Presiding Board and Supervisory Board Committees  Fol-
lowing the resignation of Oliver Zipse as executive staff representative on the Supervisory Board with effect 
from 31 March 2013, in order to take up a new management position within the BMW Group, the District 
Court of Munich – based on a proposal made by executive staff – appointed Dr Markus Schramm (Head of 
Aftersales Business Management and Mobility Services BMW Group) as executive staff representative on 
the Supervisory Board for the remaining term of office. Maria Schmidt retired on 30 June 2013 and therefore 
ceased to be a member of the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board thanked the members leaving office 
for their constructive work within the Supervisory Board. The District Court of Munich appointed Brigitte 
Rödig as employee representative on the Supervisory Board to replace Maria Schmidt for the remaining term 
of office. Following these changes, the proportion of women in the Supervisory Board remains at 20 %.
Following my own re-election to the Supervisory Board at the Annual General Meeting 2013, the Super-
visory Board again decided to elect me as its Chairman and member of the Audit Committee. In accordance 
with the relevant terms of reference, I remained Chairman of the Personnel and Nomination Committees. 
Following his re-election to the Supervisory Board, Dr Kley was again elected as the 4th Deputy Chairman 
of the Supervisory Board, as member of the Personnel and Nomination Committees and also Chairman of 
the Audit Committee. The Corporate Governance Report includes an overview of the composition of the 
Supervisory Board and its committees.
Examination of financial statements and the profit distribution proposal  KPMG AG Wirtschaftsprüfungs-
gesellschaft conducted a review of the abridged Interim Group Financial Statements and Interim Group 
Management Report for the six-month period ended 30 June 2013. The results of the review were also reported 
orally to the Audit Committee. No issues were identified that might indicate that the abridged Interim 
Group Financial Statements and Interim Group Management Report had not been prepared, in all material 
respects, in accordance with the applicable provisions.
The Group and Company Financial Statements of Bayerische Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft for the 
year ended 31 December 2013 and the Combined Management Report – as authorised for issue by the Board 
of Management on 20 February 2014 – were audited by KPMG AG Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft and 
 given an unqualified audit opinion.
The Financial Statements and the Combined Management Report, the long-form audit reports of the 
external auditors and the Board of Management’s profit distribution proposal were made available to all

13   RepoRt  of the SupeRviSoRy BoaRd
members of the Supervisory Board in a timely manner. At the meeting held on 5 March 2014, these docu-
ments were examined and discussed in detail by the Audit Committee. The Supervisory Board subsequently 
examined these documents at its meeting on 13 March 2014, after hearing the committee chairman’s report 
on the meeting of the Audit Committee. In both meetings, the Board of Management gave a detailed expla-
nation of the financial reports it had prepared. Representatives of KPMG attended both meetings, reported 
on significant findings and answered any additional questions raised by the members of the Supervisory 
Board. They also confirmed that the risk management system established by the Board of Management is 
 capable of identifying any events or developments that might impair the going-concern status of the Com-
pany and that no material weaknesses in the internal control system and risk management system were 
found with regard to the financial reporting process. Similarly, they confirmed that they had not identified 
any facts in the course of their audit work that were inconsistent with the contents of the Declaration of 
Compliance issued jointly by the two boards.
Based on thorough examination by the Audit Committee and the full Supervisory Board, we concurred 
with the results of the external audit. In accordance with the conclusion reached after the examination by 
the Audit Committee and Supervisory Board, no objections were raised. The Group and Company Financial 
Statements of Bayerische Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft for the financial year 2013 prepared by the 
Board of Management were approved at the Supervisory Meeting held on 13 March 2014. The separate finan-
cial statements have therefore been adopted.
Both in the Audit Committee and in the full Supervisory Board, we examined the proposal of the Board 
of Management to use the unappropriated profit to pay a dividend of € 2.60 per share of common stock and 
€ 2.62 per share of non-voting preferred stock. Taking account of the financial condition of the BMW Group, 
we consider the proposal appropriate and concur with it.
Expression of appreciation by the Supervisory Board  We are well aware that the motivation of our em-
ployees and their strong sense of identification with the BMW Group are key factors for its success and future 
prospects. We wish to express our appreciation to the members of the Board of Management and the entire 
workforce worldwide for their hard work and valuable contribution towards the successful financial statements 
for the year ended 31 December 2013.

Dear Shareholders,
Our vision at the BMW Group focuses on long-term thinking, successfully charting our own course and 
leading the way for our industry.
Four straight record years for the BMW Group.  For years, we have stood at the pinnacle of the world’s 
automotive premium segment. Even during the 2008 / 2009 global financial and economic crisis, we reported 
a profit and paid a dividend. Since then, the BMW Group has enjoyed four consecutive record years. Investors 
in our Company can look forward to long-term value enhancement and our shareholders can rely on us to 
achieve profitable growth – even in the face of high volatility and challenges in our business environment. For 
this  reason, we continue to invest in our future, in all areas of individual mobility. For us as a premium manu-
facturer, innovation and entrepreneurial spirit are key towards growing and creating new trends.
2013 financial year – the success continues.  Our vehicles are more desirable than ever: we delivered 
more than 1.96 million BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce cars to customers in 2013, exceeding the previous year’s 
record by 6.4 %. Individually, our three automobile brands also posted record sales, with more than 1.65 mil-
lion BMW, over 305,000 MINI and exactly 3,630 Rolls-Royce motor cars sold. We offer customers a full 
spectrum of premium products – from MINI in the small car segment to Rolls-Royce in the ultra-luxury class. 
Our core BMW brand represents sheer driving pleasure: the BMW 3 Series, 5 Series and 6 Series models 
and the BMW X1 are all leaders in their respective segments. The BMW brand also comprises efficient high-per-
formance models from BMW M and the particularly sustainable vehicles of the BMW i family, with the 
BMW i3 and, from 2014, the BMW i8.
BMW Motorrad, which celebrated its 90th anniversary last year, delivered more than 115,200 motorcycles 
to customers. In the shrinking market segment above 500 cc, BMW Motorrad defied the trend, posting sig-
nificant growth and beating the previous year’s sales by 8.3 per cent. The Financial Services segment, with 
operations in more than 50 countries, also continues to grow and made a significant contribution to our sales 
and earnings in 2013.
Valuable premium brands and desirable products and services are the foundation for our business success. 
Group profit before tax increased by 1.4 % to around € 7.9 billion in 2013, reaching the same level as our 2012 
record year, as forecast. Net profit rose by 4.5 % to more than € 5.3 billion.
These results reflect the day-to-day performance, know-how and personal commitment of our employees 
worldwide. All of us at the BMW Group share a passion for mobility. We identify with our Company and its 
products. All business areas performed well in 2013. On behalf of the Board of Management, I would like to 
thank all our employees for their dedication. I would also like to express our sincere gratitude to our retail 
organisation, suppliers and partners, who all contribute to the success of the BMW Group.
Balanced growth a key ingredient for success.  Our Company has its roots in Munich and in Germany. 
But, today, the BMW Group is a global company that sells its products in more than 140 countries. Our 
 vehicles are produced at 28 locations in 13 countries. At all our locations, we take our corporate responsibility 
seriously.

--- Page 16 ---

We target balanced growth in the three main economic regions of the world. Thanks to our highly flexible 
production network, we are able to avoid overdependence on any one region and offset market fluctuations. 
The flexibility of our production network allows us to quickly adapt to changing external circumstances.
In 2013, our sales were evenly distributed between the three main economic regions of Europe, Asia 
and the Americas. Gains in the Americas and Asia compensated for weak markets in a number of Euro-
pean countries. In 2013, our two largest single markets, China and the US, accounted for around 20 and 
19 %, respectively, of total Group sales, followed by our domestic market of Germany with around 13 % of 
sales.
When growth markets shift, it is imperative to strengthen our global presence. Since our production follows 
the market, we currently produce more than 45 % of our vehicles outside of Germany. At the same time, 
more and more countries are recognising the economic importance of a locally based automotive industry as 
a driving force for growth and employment. In late 2013, we laid the foundation stone of a new plant in the 
growth market of Brazil.
Entering into e-mobility: we deliver on our promises.  The BMW Group confirmed its position as the 
pacesetter for future mobility in 2013. In late July, the  series model of the BMW i3 made its world debut simul-
taneously in New York, London, Beijing and Munich. This innovative vehicle was specially designed for 
electric mobility and has been well-received by the media worldwide. Customer demand is far exceeding our 
expectations.
With the BMW i3, we have adopted a totally new approach to automobile manufacturing, employing new 
and especially sustainable production processes. This is the first time an entire passenger compartment made 
of carbon-fibre-reinforced plastics (CFRP) has been mass-produced. E-mobility is realised throughout our 
competence network with locations in Leipzig, Dingolfing, Landshut, Wackersdorf and Moses Lake, USA.
The BMW i3 comes with our comprehensive 360°ELECTRIC service package to ensure that everyday 
electric driving is easy and convenient for customers – through recharging at home, for example.
This will be followed in 2014 by the second model from the BMW i family, the BMW i8 plug-in hybrid 
sports car.
Step by step towards our vision for 2020.  Our vision for the year 2020 is to be the leading provider of 
premium products and premium services for individual mobility.
One thing is certain: the Company is already more than just a car manufacturer. Attractive mobility 
services and digital connectivity also play an increasingly important role. With the realignment of its BMW 
ConnectedDrive services, BMW is expanding its position as the leading provider of Internet-based in-car 
 services, focusing on driver assistance systems with comfort and safety functions, as well as infotainment 
and mobility services.
For more and more people worldwide, a vehicle is indispensable and desirable at the same time. That is 
precisely why it is so essential to adapt individual mobility to present and future demands, as well as different 
customer needs. To do this, we think far beyond the car simply as a means of transport.
To us, being the leading premium supplier also means being a leader in the field of sustainability. In every 
project, we consider environmental and social factors, as well as economic aspects, in our decision-making 
",Supervisory Board,Supervisory Board,"The Supervisory Board notes that it looked at the regulatory situation in major markets, including China, for both combustion engine vehicles and alternative drive systems. It also discusses that the Board of Management reported on the 'latest status of projects in China' as part of the annual review of the Group's Strategy Number ONE, focusing on the distribution of sales volume and added value.","Strategic engagement and active management.

“We will build  
the world’s most  
desirable cars.”

Chairman of the Board of Management 
of Daimler AG

A | TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS | letteR FRom the Ceo  11
Dear shareholders, 
We have an extraordinary year behind us. the global pandemic 
had a considerable impact on society, politics and the world 
economy, and thus also on Daimler. We responded at an early 
stage at all our sites and took a number of effective counter-
measures. our top priority was, and still is, to protect people’s 
health. At the same time, we secured our liquidity, continued 
to push forward with future projects, and set the course for our 
long-term development. our financial results significantly 
exceeded expectations in 2020, due in particular to a strong 
fourth quarter. overall, we successfully steered Daimler 
through difficult waters. i would like to thank my colleagues for 
this – for their tireless commitment, their great flexibility, and 
their strong cohesion. 
in 2020, a total of 2.8 million customers chose to buy a vehicle 
from Daimler. our revenue amounted to 154.3 billion euros. 
eBit increased by 53 percent to 6.6 billion euros. our net 
liquidity in the industrial business was 17.9 billion euros at the 
end of the year. the bottom line was a net profit of 4 billion 
euros. At the Annual shareholders’ meeting, the Board of man-
agement and the supervisory Board will propose the payment 
of a dividend of one euro and 35 cents per share. 
how did the individual divisions contribute to these results?
Mercedes-Benz AG sold 2.5 million cars and vans in 2020. in 
view of the challenging environment, we are satisfied with that. 
mercedes-Benz maintained its position as the world’s leading 
premium manufacturer. our sustainable business strategy is 
increasingly reflected by our unit sales. We tripled the sales of 
our cars with alternative drive systems in 2020 and thus 
achieved the ambitious Co2 limits in europe. China continues 
to be our biggest market. With a twelve percent increase, we 
posted record unit sales there in 2020. the most important 
new product of the past year was the new s-Class. Demand for 
our flagship is at a high level. the new model drives off the 
assembly line in Factory 56. What has long been regarded as 
the production of the future is already a reality in this new 
 factory, which combines flexibility, efficiency, digitization and 
sustainability. it is a flagship of the newly defined strategy of 
mercedes-Benz. our aspiration: We will build the world’s most 
desirable cars. 
sales of our electric vans also developed positively. in europe, 
we are the market leader in the segments of mid-size and large 
electric vans, each with a market share of more than one third.
economic uncertainties are particularly noticeable in the 
 commercial-vehicle markets. Compared with record year 2019, 
unit sales at Daimler Truck AG were down by more than a 
quarter in 2020. however, demand in our important us market 
picked up again. We were able to extend our market leadership 
in almost all of our core markets. At the same time, we set 
some important strategic markers: We will produce mercedes-
Benz trucks in China in a few years’ time, enabling us to make 
even better use of that market’s great potential. We are work-
ing with volvo in a joint venture to bring hydrogen technology 
to production maturity even faster. And we have realigned our 
strategy for autonomous driving. 
the development of automotive markets also had an impact on 
the business of Daimler Mobility AG. Contract volume 
decreased, but we continue to finance or lease half of the 
 vehicles we sell. 
Across all our divisions, we made significant progress with 
 efficiency in 2020. We will continue along this path with the 
same discipline. the pandemic has once again made it clear 
that efficiency is a prerequisite for the ability to act effectively. 
looking ahead, we are pursuing two main strategic priorities: 
digitization and electrification. We are cooperating with strong 
partners in both fields. in this way, we are not only accelerating 
technological developments, we are also sharing the costs. 
in terms of digitization, the latest generation of our mBuX 
infotainment system was launched in 2020. it will be followed 
this year by the next milestone, the mBuX hyperscreen, a dis-
play that extends across almost the entire width of the cockpit. 
this allows us to combine design, technology and interaction in 
the vehicle in a way that is currently unique. thanks to artificial 
intelligence, the system gets to know the customer better and 
better and delivers a personalized infotainment offering adapted 
to each situation.
At the same time, we are developing one of the most intelligent 
computer architectures for automated driving functions ever 
seen in a vehicle. We will roll it out across our car fleet from 2024 
onwards. Customers will then always be able to access the 
 latest software, the latest driver assistance systems or the latest 
generation of digital services long after they have bought their 
car. the idea is that the purchase of a car is no longer the high 
point between the customer and us, but rather a starting point.

We took the next step in electrification at the beginning of 
the year with the new eQA, the first all-electric mercedes-eQ 
model in the compact segment. We will continue in the spring 
with the eQs: our electric flagship in the s-Class segment  
has a range of around 700 kilometers (Wltp) on a single bat-
tery charge. the eQs will also change the way we think about 
cars. it is the first all-electric mercedes-Benz that we have 
developed as an electric car right from the start. this opens up 
new possibilities, in vehicle design, for example. Next year, 
our portfolio will include eight all-electric mercedes-eQ mod-
els. production at our own car plants will then be completely 
Co2-neutral. 
With the vans, we have developed a new platform for the next 
generation of the esprinter. this gives us maximum flexibility, 
to implement numerous body variants, for example. Because 
whether combustion engine or electric drive, the individual 
needs of our customers are at the heart of everything we do.
We are also systematically expanding our range of Co2-neutral 
options for trucks. We are pursuing a twin-track strategy here. 
series production of the battery-electric eActros starts this 
year. in parallel, we are developing fuel-cell trucks for long dis-
tances and heavier loads. We have provided a glimpse of the 
future with our gen h2 concept truck. this is a heavy-duty 
truck with a range of up to 1,000 kilometers, equivalent to that 
of a diesel truck. We are leveraging synergies and system-
atically implementing our electrification strategy also at the 
Freightliner and Fuso brands. 
All of these examples show that market environment and 
 customer requirements as well as approaches to technologies 
and partnerships differ between cars and trucks. the ongoing 
transformation is increasingly intensifying these differences. 
to shape change successfully, we need speed, agility and full 
focus on innovation more than ever. this is why we intend to 
propose to you, at an extraordinary shareholders’ meeting in 
the fall, that a significant majority interest in Daimler truck be 
transferred to the Daimler shareholders by way of a spin-off. in 
this case, it is planned that the transaction and the stock-
exchange listing of Daimler truck will be completed by the end 
of 2021. 
in this way, we want to give our trucks and buses division full 
entrepreneurial freedom – and thus the opportunity to lever-
age economies of scale even more effectively, to further 
increase profitability, and to make even faster progress on the 
road to zero-emission goods transport. At the same time, we 
want to further sharpen the profile of mercedes-Benz: as one 
of the leading suppliers of luxury cars and premium vans, with 
a strong brand, and with a clear strategic course towards tech-
nology leadership, especially for electric mobility and vehicle 
software. With independence comes maximum customer 
focus and even greater entrepreneurial responsibility. these 
are the best possible ingredients for creating added value for 
you, the shareholders, and for unleashing the full potential of 
the companies. 
For the two companies, the future of mobility will be decarbon-
ization and digitization. We set the strategic course for this long 
ago. the results can be experienced on the road today and will 
become even more visible this year. At the same time, we are 
confident that, given stable conditions, we will be able to con-
tinue the positive trend from last year in our business develop-
ment. Because we are convinced that our future will be sus-
tainably fascinating, sustainably climate-neutral, and, last but 
not least, sustainably profitable. We are shaping this change 
with courage, passion and responsibility. i look forward to you 
continuing to accompany us on this path. 
sincerely yours, 
ola Källenius

Group Chairman’s Statement
Sound progress on strategic initiatives
The Strategic Report highlights delivery to date 
against the strategic objectives laid out in last 
June’s Investor Update.
When assessing management performance during 
2015, outside of the financial results, the Board took 
particular account of the following aspects.
The successful negotiation of a majority stake  
in a new nationally licensed securities joint-venture 
in mainland China is the culmination of more  
than a decade of seeking out an appropriate 
platform through which to participate in the 
country’s fast-developing securities markets.  
Once final approvals have been received, we 
believe this will establish a landmark opportunity  
for HSBC to contribute to the development of 
China’s capital markets.
‘ Our three major businesses generated higher 
revenue, notwithstanding the uncertain 
economic environment and the considerable 
reshaping necessitated by regulatory changes’
During 2015, the Group maintained, reinforced and 
broadened its leadership position in all aspects of 
the internationalisation of the renminbi. This position 
has been built over the past five years to establish  
a highly competitive platform to service China’s 
international trade and investment flows as it 
pursues the financial liberalisation and outgoing 
investment priorities laid out in the recent 13th 
five-year plan. The recent highly successful State 
visit to the UK, following an equally successful 
Economic and Financial dialogue in China, served to 
illustrate the huge potential for mutually beneficial 
cooperation between the UK and China from which 
HSBC is uniquely positioned to benefit in the realm 
of financial services.
The disposal of our Brazilian operations, which  
is expected to complete shortly, was both timely 
and well executed. This divestment was a key 
element of the Board’s desire to simplify the Group 
and redeploy capital to geographic areas where  
we have greater competitive strength, most 
particularly in Asia. 
Our three major businesses generated higher 
revenue, notwithstanding the uncertain economic 
environment and the considerable reshaping 
necessitated by regulatory changes. Global Banking 
and Markets and Retail Banking and Wealth 
Management, in particular, have made significant 
changes to their business models and are now 
beginning to see the benefits. Commercial Banking 
continued to leverage the value of the Group’s 
international network and product capabilities. 
Global Private Banking, chastened by the exposure 
of historical failings in Switzerland, accelerated 
disposal of a number of customer portfolios as  
it refocused its business model on core customer 
segments within a fully transparent operating model. 
Across all businesses, the Board recognised  
a heightened emphasis on customer focus, which 
permeated recruitment, training, product design  
and incentives. This is essential to the restoration  
of trust.
Finally, and underpinning the above, we made 
further progress embedding the standards now 
expected to protect customers and the financial 
system from bad actors and financial crime. We are, 
however, not yet where we need to be. There is still 
more investment to make with ever greater urgency 
as more and more activity takes place digitally 
through multiple channels and via increasingly 
sophisticated mobile devices. HSBC’s determination 
to address emerging risks and identify bad actors 
remains resolute. The Board has made it one of its 
top priorities to oversee and ensure management’s 
delivery of the necessary enhancements to 
customer and transaction screening systems.
The regulatory landscape has  
become clearer
The second half of 2015 saw completion of some  
of the most important and complex initiatives 
undertaken to repair the fault lines that contributed 
to the global financial crisis. International agreement 
was reached on the amount of total loss-absorbing 
capacity that global systemically important banks, 
such as HSBC, need for orderly resolution, without 
risks to public funds. This allowed the Financial 
Stability Board to report to G20 leaders that they  
had finalised the tools needed to end ‘too big to fail’  
in the banking sector. There is still much to do  
to build these tools into national legislative and 
regulatory frameworks; however, this international 
agreement is an important step forward towards 
finally settling the capital base against which we  
can assess our target returns.

Strategic Report | Group Chairman’s Statement
There is now broad agreement that the 
implementation of the suite of regulatory reforms 
introduced post-crisis has made the financial system 
more resilient. Accordingly, public policy priorities  
are now focusing on harnessing this greater strength 
and resilience to support economic growth, which 
we welcome.
Concentration within the current regulatory  
agenda is increasingly on new and emerging risks  
and vulnerabilities. There is growing industry 
participation in dialogue around these emerging 
threats, most notably regarding cyber risk, the 
changing liquidity dynamics resulting from more 
market-based finance and financial exclusion 
stemming from excessive risk aversion. 
Likewise, addressing the root causes of the 
misconduct issues that have bedevilled our industry 
in recent years has led to growing cooperation 
arising out of the multiplicity of joint working groups 
and enquiries that have examined the most serious 
failings. 2016 sees the introduction of the new 
Senior Managers’ Regime in the UK, which will 
reinforce individual responsibility and accountability, 
which we welcome. 
Also in the UK, 2015 saw further clarity given to  
the operation of the ‘ring-fenced’ bank structure  
and a welcome announcement of a reduction in  
the scope and rate of the bank levy going forward. 
It is too early to say whether this amounts to a new 
understanding between the industry and the public,  
but it is encouraging that the industry is once again 
gaining a voice at a time of great economic and 
geopolitical uncertainty. We can only fulfil our 
essential role if we have regained trust, a fact that  
is now fully understood.
Review of headquarters’ location
As we announced last week, the Board concluded 
its review of domicile alternatives and decided 
unanimously to remain headquartered in the UK.  
As we evaluated jurisdictions against the specified 
criteria, it became clear that the combination of  
our strategic focus on Asia and maintaining our hub 
in one of the world’s leading international financial 
centres, London, was not only compatible, but 
offered the best outcome for our customers and 
shareholders. This decision was taken after some 
10 months of careful analysis and assessment  
of geopolitical, economic, regulatory and financial 
factors. Advice was taken from internationally 
respected experts and from leading financial 
advisers. After considering all the relevant factors, 
the Board concluded that having our headquarters 
in the UK and our significant business in Asia Pacific 
led from Hong Kong, delivers the best of both 
worlds to our stakeholders. The completion of this 
review closes out one of the 10 strategic actions  
set out at our Investor Update last June.
Board changes
Subsequent to the changes announced with our 
interim results, we have made further changes to 
the Board. Safra Catz stepped down from the Board 
at the end of 2015 and Sir Simon Robertson, our 
Deputy Chairman, and Rona Fairhead will retire  
at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. 
‘ There is now broad agreement that the 
implementation of the suite of regulatory 
reforms introduced post-crisis has made  
the financial system more resilient’
Safra served on the Board for nearly eight years 
while Simon and Rona are HSBC’s longest serving 
non-executive Directors, having served for close to 
10 and 12 years, respectively. Over their respective 
periods of service, they have made invaluable 
contributions to the Group, not least during the 
global financial crisis, for which the Board is 
extremely grateful. Their combined expertise and 
experience in matters of governance, audit and  
risk, remuneration, technology, and international 
business affairs has been invaluable to HSBC  
and they will, upon their retirement, be sorely 
missed. On behalf of shareholders and the Board,  
I want to take this further opportunity to recognise 
their immense contributions to HSBC.
The Board was delighted to announce the 
appointments of Paul Walsh and Henri de Castries 
as independent non-executive Directors. Paul  
joined the Board on 1 January 2016 and Henri’s 
appointment takes effect from 1 March 2016.
Paul Walsh was Group CEO of Diageo plc between 
2000 and 2013. Under his leadership, Diageo was 
refocused from a diversified food, beverage and 
hotels conglomerate into one of the world’s leading 
global alcoholic beverage businesses. In building 
this position, Paul took Diageo from a largely 
European and US business into emerging markets 
and to global leadership through the acquisition of 
many of the world’s leading brands. 
Henri de Castries has more than 25 years of 
international experience in the finance industry. 
Henri has been Chairman and Chief Executive 
Officer of AXA, one of the world’s leading global 
insurance and asset management companies since 
April 2010 after serving as Chairman of its 
Management Board from May 2000.
Their international experience and track record  
in leading the reshaping of growing businesses, 
including undertaking business portfolio 
realignments, will be of great value to the Board as 
we address the opportunities and challenges ahead.

There is a real possibility of meaningful stimulus  
for the global economy to come from further trade 
liberalisation initiatives such as the Trans-Pacific 
Partnership agreement, which was signed earlier 
this month.
The global focus on infrastructure development, 
most notably the Belt and Road initiative in China 
and the Juncker plan in Europe will expand public/
private financing opportunities. 
Similarly, the agreements reached on climate change 
at the recent COP21 conference in Paris will require 
further significant infrastructure renewal. They  
will also greatly expand the market for sustainable 
financing options such as green bonds where HSBC 
is a leading participant. Reinforcing this position,  
the Group recently committed $1bn to a green  
bond portfolio to fund projects in sectors such  
as renewable energy, energy efficiency, clean 
transportation and climate change adaption as  
well as SME financing in sectors such as public 
transport, education and healthcare.
Technology advancements in financial services are 
broadening access, improving customer service and 
lowering the costs of service delivery. At the same 
time, the amount of data held digitally is exploding, 
reinforcing the need to bolster cyber security. There 
is an urgent public policy need to clarify how 
responsibility is to be shared, given the growing 
number of routes through which customers can 
authorise movement of money from their accounts 
or the sharing of data within these accounts.
We enter 2016 with a clear strategy and with much  
of the Group’s required reshaping completed or under 
way. Our 264,000 staff, like their predecessors, went 
the extra mile consistently throughout 2015 to meet 
the demands placed on them by our customers, 
regulators and the public. I want to place on the 
record the Board’s appreciation of that commitment 
and our gratitude for what they have achieved to 
make HSBC fit for the next 150 years.

Group Chairman’s Statement
looking back – our 150th anniversary
In 2015, HSBC marked its 150th anniversary by 
recognising its staff for their essential contributions 
through the ages, and its customers for their shared 
commitment and loyalty. As we enter the next 
period of our history, I want to reiterate these 
messages of gratitude and underline our recognition 
that such commitment and loyalty have to be earned.
HSBC has also always recognised its responsibilities 
to the communities it serves and so in this special 
year committed $150m of additional funding  
to community projects around the world over  
three years.
We also wanted to identify a distinctive cause with 
global significance to mark our special anniversary.
‘ We enter 2016 with a clear strategy and with 
much of the Group’s required reshaping 
completed or under way’
We were delighted, therefore, to announce a 
partnership with Cancer Research UK to support  
the scientific leaders of tomorrow through a  
$25m contribution towards the development  
and construction of the Francis Crick Institute.  
This state-of-the-art biomedical research facility  
will open in the heart of London in 2016 and support 
more than 1,200 scientists, collaborating to tackle 
the diseases that pose the greatest threat to 
humanity – cancer, heart disease, lung disease  
and infectious diseases, including HIV and malaria.
To mark HSBC’s support, 150 PhD students, 
selected from across the world, will have the 
opportunity to conduct vital research at the  
new institute. 
looking ahead
Current market conditions are inevitably concentrating 
attention on the risks that exist within the global 
economy. It is, however, important also to recognise 
again the resilience that our diversified business 
model and balance sheet strength provide, as well  
as noting the many counterbalances that should help 
to underpin the global economy.
China’s slower economic growth will undoubtedly 
contribute to a bumpier financial environment, but  
it is still expected to be the largest contributor to 
global growth as its economy transitions to higher 
added value manufacturing and services and 
becomes more consumer driven. This transition  
is driving our focus on the Pearl River Delta as a 
priority growth opportunity given its concentration  
of high tech, research focused and digital businesses.

Group Chief 
Executive’s Review
HSBC is better balanced, better connected  
and better placed to capitalise on higher return 
businesses than it was 12 months ago. 
Business performance 
Our performance in 2015 again demonstrated the 
fundamental strength of our business. Targeted 
investment, prudent lending and our diversified, 
universal banking business model helped us achieve 
revenue growth in a difficult market environment 
whilst also reducing risk-weighted assets.  
We also started to implement the actions that  
we announced at our Investor Update in June  
to adapt HSBC to new operating conditions. 
Completing these plans will refocus the business  
to achieve stronger, sustainable growth and we  
are acting on them quickly and efficiently.
On an adjusted basis, we grew revenue over the 
course of the year. Global Banking and Markets 
performed strongly and Commercial Banking grew 
steadily in spite of slower trade. Principal Retail 
Banking and Wealth Management also grew 
following a strong Wealth Management performance 
in the first half. Global Private Banking grew in  
Asia, but was down overall due to the impact  
of the continued repositioning of the business.
Our adjusted operating expenses increased  
as we continued to strengthen our compliance 
capability whilst also investing for growth. However, 
a combination of strict cost management and the 
cost reduction programmes that we started in the 
middle of the year helped us keep second half costs 
flat relative to the first half, excluding the bank levy. 
Loan impairment charges remained generally low 
despite an increase in provisions towards the end  
of the year. This demonstrates again our prudent 
approach to lending and the benefit of our de-risking 
measures since 2011. 
In total, we generated $11.3bn of capital in  
2015, which enabled us to increase the dividend 
and strengthen the common equity tier 1 ratio.

Group Chief Executive’s Review
Adapting HSBC
The plans that we announced at our Investor Update 
are designed to grow income, reduce costs and 
thereby increase our return on equity. There is a  
lot to do to achieve our targets but we have made  
a good start.
Reducing our risk-weighted assets (‘RWAs’) is vital 
to achieving a better return for shareholders. In 
2015, management action reduced RWAs by 
$124bn, which takes us nearly half-way towards  
our target to be achieved by the end of 2017. Much 
of this reduction came from Global Banking and 
Markets, although a large proportion also came from 
Commercial Banking, accelerated asset sales in our 
US Consumer and Mortgage Lending portfolio and 
the sale of our investment in Industrial Bank. We 
expect to deliver further RWA reductions in 2016,  
in addition to a decrease of around $33bn from  
the sale of our business in Brazil.
‘ The plans that we announced at our Investor 
Update are designed to grow income, reduce 
costs and increase our return on equity. There  
is a lot to do to achieve our targets but we have 
made a good start’
We have received a number of offers for our 
business in Turkey since June, none of which  
were deemed to be in the best interests of 
shareholders. We have therefore decided to retain 
and restructure our Turkish operations, maintaining 
our wholesale banking business and refocusing  
our retail banking network. This will provide better 
value for shareholders and continue to allow our 
clients to capitalise on HSBC’s international footprint.
Our cost-reduction measures are already having  
an impact on our cost base and HSBC is now a 
leaner business than at the half-year. All of our 
initiatives to reduce costs are under way and  
we expect further progress in 2016. 
We continued to redevelop our businesses in the 
US and Mexico over the course of 2015. These are 
important businesses in the context of the wider 
Group and we are committed to turning them 
around. An increase in cross-border business  
across the NAFTA area and improved collaboration 
between global businesses helped to generate 
increased revenue. They remain works in progress. 
We are investing in areas of the business that 
extract the greatest gain from our international 
network and market-leading strength in Asia. 
Investment in flagship transaction banking products 
helped to increase our market share, particularly  
in Payments and Cash Management, Foreign 
Exchange and Securities Services. 
The development of our Asia businesses is  
gaining momentum and we achieved growth  
in excess of GDP in seven out of eight of our 
priority Asia markets. 
We continue to expand our business in the Pearl 
River Delta and reached a number of milestones  
in 2015, including the signing of an agreement  
to form the first majority foreign-owned securities 
company in mainland China. When approved,  
this will allow us to engage in the full spectrum  
of securities business in the country. 
We remain the world’s number one bank for offshore 
renminbi services and increased revenue by 3% 
year-on-year in this vitally important growth market. 
Summary and outlook
HSBC is better balanced, better connected  
and better placed to capitalise on higher return 
businesses than it was 12 months ago. Our 
universal banking model is generating higher 
income from collaboration between businesses  
and our operating expenses and capital ratio  
are trending in the right direction. Maintaining  
these trends while boosting revenue will be  
the principal challenge in the year ahead. 
The current economic environment is uncertain,  
but our diversified banking model, low earnings 
volatility and strong capital generation give us 
strength and resilience that will stand us in  
good stead. 
We remain focused on delivering our nine remaining 
strategic actions by the end of 2017.

The value of our international network 
comes from our connections to the 
people and companies that drive 
economic activity. We provide products 
and services to meet diverse financial 
needs – from purchasing a music 
download to financing the construction of 
an international airport. Our relationships 
reflect the geographic reach of our 
network and the range of customers  
we support. For further details on our 
global businesses, see pages 28 to 31.
Our network of clients enables us to  
have greater insight into trade and capital 
flows across supply chains. When  
we bank clients on both sides of a 
transaction, we can help them overcome 
obstacles and manage risk and liquidity 
costs more effectively. We are uniquely 
positioned to be the bridge between 
customers, both large and small,  
around the world.
We develop our products and services  
to be globally consistent and to represent 
the highest standards across all of our 
markets. This allows us to serve our 
clients efficiently and in a consistent  
way wherever we serve them. 
By providing a wide range of product 
capabilities and resources, we bring 
additional benefits to customers and 
efficiencies to the Group. Our global 
businesses work together to offer tailored 
solutions to the various client segments 
we serve across the Group with a higher 
level of performance and greater ease  
of use. 
For example, we can provide Markets 
products to small businesses as well as 
large multinational companies. We insure 
risks for individuals and corporations alike. 
We aim to develop long-term relationships 
that lead to us supplying products  
and services from across our global 
businesses. Many of our private banking 
clients, for example, own companies  
that are Commercial Banking or Global 
Banking and Markets (‘GB&M’) clients.  
By sharing knowledge and expertise,  
our businesses continuously enhance  
our capabilities and operations. 
In 2015, business synergy revenue  
were equivalent to 19% of total revenue 
for the Group. We grew revenue across 
the majority of the cross-business 
synergies we track, including a 7% 
increase in revenue from Payments  
and Cash Management (‘PCM’) products 
sold to GB&M customers.

Chief Executive Ofﬁcer
Dear Shareholders,
Last year, I described P&G’s Purpose-inspired Growth Strategy, which is to
touch and improve more consumers’ lives in more parts of the world more
completely. I told you that we intend to deliver total shareholder return
that consistently ranks P&G among the top third of our peers — the best-
performing consumer products companies in the world. To do this, we
must deliver the Company’s long-term annual growth goals, which are to:
(cid:333)(cid:3)Grow organic sales 1% to 2% faster than
market growth in the categories and countries
where we compete
(cid:333)(cid:3)Deliver core earnings per share (core EPS) growth
of high single to low double digits
(cid:333)(cid:3)Generate free cash ﬂow productivity of
90% or greater

--- Page 4 ---
2 The Procter & Gamble Company
We made meaningful progress toward these long-term goals
for ﬁscal 2011, despite signiﬁcant external challenges.
Growth Drivers
(cid:333)(cid:3) Organic sales grew 4%. Organic volume grew 5%.
(cid:333)(cid:3) Core earnings per share grew 8%.
(cid:333)(cid:3) Free cash ﬂow productivity was 84% of net earnings.
We increased our quarterly dividend by 9%, making
this the 121st consecutive year that P&G has paid
a dividend and the 55th consecutive year that the
dividend has increased.
Over the past 55 years, P&G’s dividend has increased at an
annual compound average rate of approximately 9.5%. In total,
we paid approximately $5.8 billion in dividends in ﬁscal 2011.
We also returned $7.0 billion to shareholders through the
repurchase of P&G stock. Based on our current market
capitalization, dividends and share repurchase, we provided
shareholders with an effective cash yield of nearly 7%, with
additional potential for capital appreciation.
This is good performance in a very demanding business and
economic environment. It is not yet great performance. I am
conﬁdent, however, that we will continue to grow our business
on the strength of our Purpose-inspired Growth Strategy:
(cid:333)(cid:3) We are executing the strategy as planned, with
unrelenting focus on innovation.
(cid:333)(cid:3) We are increasing productivity, which frees up resources
to invest in innovation.
(cid:333)(cid:3) We continue to strengthen our portfolio of businesses.
(cid:333)(cid:3) We are tackling growth challenges head on.
(cid:333)(cid:3) We have solid, executable plans in place to capture the
enormous growth potential that our strategy creates.
Further, P&G people are inspired and are performing heroically
to improve lives, to grow our business, and to create value
for our shareholders. My objective, with this Letter, is to explain
what we are doing in each of these areas.
P&G’s Purpose is to touch and improve people’s everyday lives.
This is an inspiring but demanding aspiration. There are nearly
seven billion people on the planet today and we are currently
reaching about 4.4 billion of them. We want to reach all of
them with products and services that make their everyday lives a
little better. We know that if we do this well, we’ll be rewarded
with sales and proﬁt growth, market share leadership, a strong
company reputation and, ultimately, the creation of value that
allows our people, our shareholders and the communities in
which we live and work to prosper.
Our growth strategy, which we established two years ago, is
inspired by our Purpose. We are executing this strategy by
innovating to improve people’s everyday lives in every part of
the world, and by then expanding our portfolio of innovation
up and down price tiers, into new markets, and into new and
existing product categories.
This strategy is fundamentally right for P&G because it inspires
our people and our partners, focuses us where the growth
opportunities are greatest, and leverages our core strengths:
consumer understanding, brand building, go-to-market capability,
global scale and, most importantly, innovation.
Innovation Wins Decades
Innovation is the driving force behind our strategy, as it always
has been at P&G. Our experience has proven that price promotion
may win a quarter here and there, but innovation wins decades.
There are many examples to prove this. Take our Laundry
business in the U.K., for instance. In the late 1970s, we were
competing hard just to defend and maintain our 35% market
share leadership position. We then stepped up our innovation
efforts. In the three decades since, we’ve introduced a series of
game-changing innovations such as Daz automatic detergent,
concentrated liquid detergent, and most recently, Liquitabs.
We now enjoy around a 50% share.
We’ve seen the same dynamic in Oral Care. In the 1990s, we
lost our historical lead versus our top competitor because they
simply out-innovated us. We stepped up our innovation game
once again and delivered a string of product breakthroughs
including Crest Whitestrips, Crest Pro-Health, and Crest 3D White.
We restored P&G’s leadership of the U.S. Dentifrice category,
which is now enabling us to expand these innovative products
around the world.

I’ll share one more example. Head & Shoulders was a relatively
small, primarily North American brand a decade ago. We invested
in a combination of marketing and product innovations and
then began to expand the brand globally. Since then, we have
more than tripled sales and Head & Shoulders is now the largest
shampoo brand in the world.
These and other experiences reinforce our commitment to
innovation as the fundamental driver of P&G’s growth.
We invest about $2 billion a year in Research &
Development — about 60% more than our next
closest competitor and more than most of our
competitors combined.
The investment continues to pay off. We currently have the
strongest innovation and global expansion program in P&G history.
We are globalizing products such as Gillette Fusion ProGlide,
Crest 3D White, Laundry additives, and the Pampers thinness
and absorbency upgrade.
We’re also expanding successful marketing innovation such
as the Shiksha education program in India, in which P&G
contributes a brick to build a school for each pack of product
purchased, or the Pampers “One Pack Equals One Vaccine”
campaign with its focus on eradicating maternal and neonatal
tetanus. The Old Spice “Smell Like a Man, Man” campaign
generated consumer excitement and demand that catapulted
the brand to market leadership. P&G’s global sponsorship
of the Olympic Games provides an outstanding platform for
integrated, multi-branded commercial innovation.
In this past ﬁscal year, we grew or held market share on
businesses representing about 60% of our sales, which is the best
indication that consumers are rewarding P&G innovation despite
a highly competitive and demanding economic environment.
We also continue to earn external recognition for our
innovations. In 2010, P&G launched eight of the top 25 most
successful new products in the consumer products industry
in North America, as measured by SymphonyIRI Group
(which recognized us last year as one of the most innovative
manufacturers in the U.S. Consumer Packaged Goods Industry
for the past decade, presenting us with an Outstanding
Achievement in Innovation Award). Crest 3D White was
the most successful new product launch measured by
SymphonyIRI Group last year. For the past 16 years, P&G has
had 132 products on the top 25 New Product Pacesetters list,
more than our six largest competitors combined.
In 2011, P&G along with our agencies brought
home a record-setting 32 Cannes Lion awards
(which recognize the world’s best advertising and
communications) at the Cannes Lions International
Festival of Creativity (formerly known as the
International Advertising Festival). This was nearly
double our previous record of 17 — and more than
double the combined number of Lions awarded to
our six closest competitors. We were also awarded
the title of Most Effective Marketer in the World
by Efﬁe Worldwide.

All this reﬂects P&G’s deep and abiding commitment to
innovation, which is always the best driver of long-term
sustainable growth — for P&G’s business and for the categories
in which we compete. In the section that follows this Letter,
you will ﬁnd a series of stories that bring P&G innovation to
life — stories that show how P&G people innovate for the way
everyday life is lived and, as a result, improve lives in every
moment of the day, in every part of the world, through
everything we do.
1.
Integrated Plans for Developing Markets
We are creating multi-category plans for our top-priority
developing markets. These are plans that bring together
multiple categories and multifunctional capabilities in ways
that an individual brand or category team could not. They
reduce affordability barriers, accelerate speed of market entry,
increase relevance to distributors, retailers, governments
and potential employees, and create greater probabilities
of success.
Productivity Fuels Innovation
Productivity is the second critical growth driver for P&G.
Improved productivity frees up resources to invest in innovation
that improves lives and drives top- and bottom-line growth.
It is a virtuous cycle.
Our three most important productivity initiatives in
the Company today are integration, simpliﬁcation
and digitization. They are highly interdependent and
mutually reinforcing.
Integration
Integrating to operate more fully as a single company is the
way we turn our size into scale and our scale into faster growth
and cost advantage. For many years, the focus was on individual
brands. We then shifted to managing on a regional product
category basis and, later, to a global category basis. We’re now
operating through Global Business Units and Market Development
Organizations to go to market as a single Company, rather than
as categories, and have expanded our Global Business Services
organization to scale work and to provide better operational
support at lower cost.
For the most part, each of these evolutionary steps made P&G
more cost efﬁcient and incrementally faster, but we still weren’t
getting the full beneﬁt of our scale. We are now beginning to
reap greater scale advantages by integrating as one Company.
3.
There are multiple efforts under way throughout the organization,
but I’ll highlight three of the most important ones to illustrate
how we create Company scale.
We’ve launched these plans over the past 18 months in
several markets, including the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia,
India, and China) and successfully accelerated our historic
growth rates. Brazil is a good example. Our integrated plan
for that market will double the number of categories in
which P&G competes in the next few years. We launched
two new categories this year (Skin Care and Air Care) with
three more planned for 2012. We’ve accelerated sales growth
from a 12% average over the 2006 – 2009 period to 28% in
2010 and 32% this past year. We’ve seen similar results in other
countries. We will continue to execute these plans in our
top-priority developing markets over the next several years.
2. Multi-Brand Commercial Innovation
We’re creating more multi-brand programs such as our
Olympic Games sponsorship, Future Friendly (an environ-
mental sustainability initiative) and P&G Brand Saver
(a dedicated newspaper insert of advertising, coupons and
consumer education). These multi-brand initiatives earn
signiﬁcantly higher returns than many independent brand
programs. They beneﬁt from association with P&G as the
parent company, cost less to execute, and attract broad
retail support. Here, too, we can bring a broad, strong and
diverse mix of leading brands to these executions that other
companies with narrower portfolios simply cannot do.
Integrated Supply Chain
We’re moving from large, single-category manufacturing
plants to more localized, scaled multi-category facilities that
enable us to lower cost by leveraging the same infrastructure
(utilities, roads, rail spurs — which are often up to 50% of
the cost of a new plant), as well as lower transportation and
delivery costs. Accelerating local production also enables us
to use local talent and materials. At the same time, these
operations enable us to improve customer service with more
frequent multi-category full-truck deliveries.
This, like multi-brand commercial innovation, creates com-
petitive advantage that is difﬁcult for more narrowly focused
competitors to match.

Digitization
Our third major productivity effort is dramatically increased use
of digital technology. Our intention is to make P&G the most
technology-enabled company in the world. We are achieving
this by focusing on four key areas: We want to enable one-on-
one relationships with customers and consumers around the
world; we are focused on harnessing the power of real-time
business intelligence to aid decision making; we are accelerating
innovation by using digital technology to create visibility from
molecule-creation to the store shelf; and we are standardizing
best-in-class systems to integrate data.
Digitizing P&G will enable us to manage the business
in real time and on a demand-driven basis. We’ll be
able to collaborate more effectively and efﬁciently,
inside and outside the Company. And we’ll interact
with consumers, retail partners and others far more
directly and frequently than we can do today.
We’re already seeing the beneﬁts of digitization. We are
increasingly making business decisions faster and more
collaboratively with real-time data. We’re using virtual reality
technologies to reduce cost and increase the speed of
innovation. We are reducing the number of physical product
mock-ups created for new product initiatives. Virtual shelving
and displays are simplifying the way we test our brands with
top customers, and new product modeling tools are improving
our engineering and design productivity.
Employees are connecting faster through high-
deﬁnition technology that is reducing the need for
travel by as much as 20,000 trips per year, saving
$50 million annually.
All these productivity efforts are focused on one goal: high-quality
proﬁtable growth achieved on the strength of P&G innovation
and with the ﬁnancial and operational discipline that you expect
of P&G — and which we demand of ourselves.
Simpliﬁcation
Simpliﬁcation is also a critical driver of productivity. We’re pursuing
opportunities in a wide range of areas, two of which are the most
far-reaching.
1. Simplifying the Business
We’re simplifying the business by creating standard manu-
facturing platforms with common packages, formulas,
materials, equipment and operational systems. This enables
faster speed to market and concurrent product launches
across regions at a lower cost. We’re moving from more
than 500 manufacturing platforms as of two years ago to
a target of about 150 platforms by 2014. We think this is
worth about $500 million in savings worldwide.
Product simpliﬁcation is also a big opportunity. Today, we
have more than 50,000 unique products and we believe
we can increase the productivity of our portfolio of offerings
by 30% over three years. We are investing in new tools and
using deep shopper insight to simplify product lines and
increase consumer and shopper satisfaction. Our research
shows that in certain categories shoppers feel they have more
choices after category options are reduced because there
is less clutter and confusion; they can more easily ﬁnd the
product that meets their speciﬁc need.
2. Simplifying Processes that Support our Business
P&G currently has 5,000 Product Supply Planners distributed
over 300 locations globally. Over the next three years, we
will consolidate planning tasks into regional planning centers
and implement new simulation tools. This centralization and
digitization will improve productivity and create deeper,
more sustainable organizational capabilities. Simplifying our
planning processes and implementing new technologies will
lower transportation and warehousing costs and improve
productivity by 25% or more.
Packaging simpliﬁcation is another big opportunity. P&G
spends over $5 billion annually on packaging materials and
more than $250 million on packaging development costs.
The packaging development process touches every function
in the Company, involves more than 3,000 employees, and
has signiﬁcant opportunities for simpliﬁcation and cost
savings. We are implementing virtualized end-to-end pack-
aging development tools, which we believe can drive a 30%
reduction in packaging costs and release 30% of the time
spent today on package design.

Strategic Choices Create a Winning Portfolio
We continue to take steps to strengthen P&G’s portfolio of
businesses, which enables us to focus on our greatest growth
opportunities. Two years ago, we exited our pharmaceuticals
business. This was an industry where the innovation model did
not play to P&G’s strengths, where there was little go-to-market
synergy with the rest of P&G’s businesses, and where branding
was inherently difﬁcult and less relevant. We felt that exiting
pharmaceuticals would allow us to focus our efforts on consumer-
oriented health care, where we can more clearly apply our
Company’s strengths and where there are strong economic
and demographic tailwinds.
We are advancing this over-the-counter (OTC) focus with the
intent to form a joint venture with Teva Pharmaceutical Industries,
which we announced earlier this year. We will maintain our
North America OTC business, which generates 60% of our total
OTC sales. We will gain access to Teva’s manufacturing scale as
the largest prescription drug manufacturer in the world, to their
library of molecules including several prescription-to-OTC switch
portfolios, to their highly effective regulatory capabilities, and to
best-in-class pharmacy coverage in many markets. Teva will
further strengthen its position with major pharmacy customers
around the world and leverage P&G’s consumer understanding
and brand-building strengths. This partnership will allow both
companies to signiﬁcantly accelerate entry into additional OTC
categories and markets.
Negotiations continue to progress well as we work to close the
transaction by the end of this calendar year.
We closed the Ambi Pur acquisition and have completed a
successful integration. Through a combination of the acquisition
and organic expansions of the Febreze brand, we have grown
our Air Care presence from 17 markets to nearly 90 markets.
And, most recently, through a disciplined approach and two
rounds of negotiations, we agreed to divest Pringles to
Diamond Foods. This transaction is expected to close by the
end of calendar 2011 and will complete P&G’s exit from the
food and beverage business.
Strengthening our business portfolio is an ongoing process. We
continually evaluate the strength of our portfolio by assessing
category attractiveness across three dimensions: industry
attractiveness (market size, growth and structural economics),
competitive position (share, proﬁtability versus industry, brand
equity/consumer purchase intent versus competition), and
portfolio ﬁt (ability to apply the Company’s core capabilities of
brand building innovation, consumer understanding, go to
market and scale). Based on this evaluation, we believe that our
current portfolio is the strongest it has been in many years and
provides a highly strategic platform for market leadership and
sustainable growth.
These are the cornerstones of P&G’s growth strategy and our
ability to create sustainable shareholder value: innovation that
improves everyday life in every part of the world … fueled by
productivity that frees up resources to invest … in a portfolio
of businesses and brands designed for growth.
Growth Challenges
As we executed the Company’s growth strategy this past year,
we faced a number of extremely challenging external head-
winds — two of which are most important and most likely to
continue in the year ahead.
We are facing rapid and signiﬁcant increases in commodity costs.
Materials and energy costs were up more than $1.8 billion
before tax for the ﬁscal year. We’re taking a holistic approach
to manage these cost increases.
(cid:333)(cid:3) We’re turning up the dial on our productivity and
cost-savings initiatives, as indicated previously.
(cid:333)(cid:3) We’re creating alternative product formulations and
developing materials that use renewable feedstocks.
(cid:333)(cid:3) We’re reducing our dependency on commodity and
energy costs through our own and our suppliers’
sustainability efforts.
(cid:333)(cid:3) We’re increasing prices where necessary, coupled
with innovation where possible, to deliver the best
consumer value.
We expect commodity costs to continue escalating in the year
ahead and will remain highly disciplined to ensure we can offset
increases as fully as possible while continuing to invest in growth
and create shareholder value.
Developed markets are growing slower than expected. These
markets — principally North America, Western Europe and
Japan — account for about two-thirds of our sales. Their under-
performance reduced total Company growth by one percentage
point in ﬁscal year 2011.

--- Page 9 ---
The Procter & Gamble Company 7
Our primary response to slow-growth markets is innovation —
the only sustainable way to grow faster than the markets
in which we compete. Innovation creates consumer value,
stimulates market growth and attracts retail support. We don’t
anticipate accelerated economic recovery in developed markets
in the coming year, but we remain conﬁdent that our focus
on creating and expanding innovations will enable us to grow
even where underlying market growth rates remain soft.
On this basis, we currently compete in only about one-third
of the potential segments. Here, too, we are expanding our
presence. We’ve recently introduced the Crest 3D White lineup,
Gillette Fusion ProGlide, and Olay ProX as premium products.
At lower price points, innovations such as Gillette Guard
(our entry point razor system in India), Pampers Simply Dry
and Gain Dishwashing Liquid are attracting new consumers
to P&G brands.
Growth Opportunities
I have spent most of this Letter explaining the factors that
are driving and challenging P&G’s growth today. I want to
conclude by looking forward and reafﬁrming my strong
conﬁdence that we have the right strategy and supporting
capability to grow well into the future.
The growth opportunities created by our strategy are clearest
when you look at population and economic growth trends
and our geographic expansion plans.
It’s estimated that the world’s population will be
nearly eight billion people by 2020. All these
people — in developed and developing countries
alike — will have the same fundamental needs,
wants and aspirations for products and services
that make their lives better. There is tremendous
potential for P&G to grow by meeting those needs.
We are going after this potential by making our products
available in more categories, countries and channels,
expanding product lines to meet a fuller range of regimen
needs, and stimulating market growth.
We currently compete in a total of 38 product categories.
Today, on average, we compete in 19 categories in any given
country. In our most developed market, the United States,
we compete in 35 product categories. In Russia and Mexico,
we’re in the 20s. In China, Brazil and India, we’re in the
mid-to-high teens. In Nigeria, we’re in the mid-single-digits.
Our ﬁve-year plan will increase the average number of
categories from 19 to 24.
Within each of these categories and countries, there are
generally ﬁve distinct price tiers — ranging from the best
performing and highest priced products in the super premium
and premium tiers, down to products that offer basic
beneﬁts at a lower price in the value tier.
We are also making P&G brands available in more retail
channels. Today, we compete in less than 40% of possible
channel segments. Across the seven predominant channels,
the vast majority of our current business is in four of them.
We are executing plans now to increase our presence in
all channels.
We are ﬁlling out product lines to fulﬁll consumers’ regimen
needs. A good example is Pantene in Japan, where we have
recently redesigned our regimen and pricing strategy.
Japanese women are meticulous about caring for their hair.
Many use up to eight steps throughout the day. It starts
with a nighttime shampoo washing, then a conditioner and
in-shower treatment. Then she uses a jar treatment before
bed. In the morning, she uses water to get the frizz out and
applies a leave-in treatment. She carries a tube treatment in
her purse for midday application, and she applies another
treatment when she gets home in the evening. We were
previously serving her in only a few of these subcategories.
By launching a full line, addressing all points in her regimen,
we’ve increased our average sales per unit of Pantene by
nearly 15% and market share has continued to grow.
In addition to entering and creating new markets, we need
to grow our current markets, which we do by driving usage
frequency and trade-up to higher value items. Consider our
position in the diaper market in Egypt. Pampers currently
has roughly an 80% share of the disposable diaper market.
However, only about 10% of changes are done with disposable
diapers. The rest are done with cloth or nothing at all. In India,
Duracell has a share of over 75% of the alkaline battery
market — which sounds good, until you realize that only about
3% of batteries used are alkaline. Our growth in these markets
will not be dependent on growing share. It will be dependent
on growing markets.

--- Page 10 ---
Increasing market share by ﬁve points in each of these
three businesses is more than a $20 billion sales
opportunity.
Looked at a different way, we generate annual sales of
about $96 per person in the U.S. today. We generate
about $20 per person in Mexico. Our sales in China
are only about $4 per person. Indonesia is just over $1,
and India and Sub-Saharan Africa are just under $1.
Getting per capita spending on P&G products in these
four big markets up to the level of Mexico would add
more than $60 billion to annual sales.
Economic growth should help. A study released
in November 2010 by the Boston Consulting Group
projected that over the next decade China will add
270 million consumers to its middle-income and
afﬂuent class. This is roughly the same number as
there are in the U.S. today. The study went on to say
that 41% of the current middle-income and afﬂuent
class plans to trade up to more premium products —
especially in packaged goods and clothing.
In 2009, when we established our growth strategy, we
were serving four billion consumers. We established a
goal of increasing the number of consumers we serve
by 1 billion by 2014 / 15. Last year, we served 4.2 billion
consumers — and remain on track to serve 5 billion
by 2015.
Today, consumers purchase a P&G product
about 40 billion times a year. As a result
of the strategy and plans we are executing
currently, we expect to increase those
purchases to about 60 billion a year by the
midpoint of this decade.
8 The Procter & Gamble Company
We have seen ﬁrsthand how fast markets can develop
when we launch new innovation and build broad-based
consumer awareness of our products. For example,
the size of the Greater China diaper market was only
$200 million in the year 2000 — when Pampers was
just starting to gain a foothold. Today, the China diaper
market is $2.8 billion — an increase of 14 times in ten
years. This level of market growth happens when brands
like Pampers innovate in ways that genuinely improve
people’s everyday lives. We know, for example, that
when babies stay dry throughout the night, they sleep
better, which in turn helps them grow and develop.
We innovate based on insights like this and consumers
reward us because they value the improvements our
innovations bring to their lives. We want to bring this
kind of innovation to more consumers in more parts of
the world, and we have abundant opportunity to do
so. In China and India, the average consumer changes
a diaper less than once per day, in Brazil twice per day
and in the U.S. four times per day. Getting China and
India usage levels up to the levels of Brazil represents
not only a $2.5 billion opportunity for Pampers, but also
the chance to improve parents’ and babies’ lives in
very fundamental ways.
In India, the market size for wet shaving systems grew
by 15% in just one year following the launch of our
low-cost Mach3 razor. We’re working to accelerate that
growth with Gillette Guard.
Developed markets can also be stimulated to drive
higher growth as we demonstrated with the Febreze
“I Wish I Could Wash” advertising campaign in Japan,
which restored the growth of the brand in that country.
Clearly, we see huge opportunities for growth, and for
our consumers, behind our Purpose-inspired Growth
Strategy. We are expanding into more categories,
countries, and channels. We are meeting a broader
range of consumer needs. We are stimulating market
growth in developed and developing markets alike.
And our portfolio of businesses presents abundant
opportunity to grow. We have the largest Beauty and
Grooming business in the world, with a market share
of only 18%. We have the second largest consumer
health care business in the world and we have only a
6% share. In Household Care, our oldest and most
developed business, we have only a 27% share.

  Other Information 
 Report of the Supervisory Board  
In the course of our work on corporate governance, we further developed and updated 
parts of the Supervisory Board’s skills matrix, which was introduced in 2022. Based on a 
self-assessment, we concluded that the composition of the Supervisory Board at 31 De-
cember 2023 fully meets the targets stipulated in the diversity concept and the competency 
profile. 
In the Declaration of Compliance with the German Corporate Governance Code issued in 
December 2023, the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board confirmed that they 
have complied with the recommendations of the Code as amended on 28 April 2022 with-
out exception and will continue to fully comply with them in future. 
The Board of Management updated the members of the Supervisory Board biannually on 
the current status of the level of attainment of defined financial KPIs and the KPIs for our 
ESG targets, such as deliveries of all-electric automobiles, fleet carbon emissions, attrac-
tiveness as an employer, and diversity. 
In addition, key topics from the Board of Management’s individual areas of 
responsibility were on our agenda. Markets in the USA, Canada and Mexico as well as the 
“fourth pillar” markets, in particular India, South Korea and Japan, were the subject of an in-
depth sales report. We discussed regional resilience and the growth strategy for these mar-
kets in great depth.  
We also dealt with the Group’s compliance management system in great depth. In his an-
nual report, the Chief Compliance Officer presented changes to the structure and content of 
the BMW Group’s compliance management system and the revision of compliance regula-
tions. The report also addressed the implementation of the German Supply Chain Due Dili-
gence Act and the handling of individual cases. Moreover, at the Compliance Days in Mu-
nich, the Chief Compliance Officer relayed a message from the Chairman of the Board of 
Management that set the “tone from the top”, and addressed operational prevention 
measures.  
At each meeting, the Board of Management informed us about the current status of important 
legal framework conditions and regulatory projects. These included in particular the EU’s reg-
ulations regarding fleet carbon emissions in conjunction with the EU’s “Fit for 55” package 
and the Euro 7 emissions standards.  
The Supervisory Board examined the Board of Management’s remuneration in great de-
tail. It reviewed the target structure, maximum remuneration and expected remuneration for 
the Board of Management for the financial year 2023, considering in particular the Group’s 
performance and the development of remuneration for senior executives and employees in 
Germany over the past few years. Based on a comparative study conducted by an external 
independent remuneration consultant and subsequent oral advice, we concluded that the 
remuneration paid to Board of Management members for the financial year 2022 and the 
target remuneration for 2023 were appropriate. Detailed information on the Board of Man-
agement’s remuneration for the financial year 2023 is provided in the Remuneration Re-
port. In December 2023, following thorough preparation by the Personnel Committee, we 
adopted the variable remuneration targets applicable to Board of Management members 
for the financial year 2024, taking into account the budget for 2024, the long-term business 
plan and the BMW Group’s corporate strategy, including its ESG goals. 
In the highly detailed risk report, we were brought up to date with the structure and working 
methods of the risk management system. A key focus of the report was on geopolitical risks, 
especially in the areas of purchasing/supply chains and sales markets as well as the 
presentation of measures to mitigate risk. On the subject of information security with a focus 
on IT security, we were informed about the organisation and functioning of the information 
security management system and the structure of the IT security risk model, as well as the 
measures derived from it and their effectiveness. The Board of Management also reported 
on the business performance, sector-specific risk profile and current projects of the Finan-
cial Services segment. In addition, we received a report on key topics relating to the Group’s 
treasury system, such as funding, liquidity management, hedging strategies for price and 
currency risks and the current state of share buyback programmes.  
In conjunction with the report on HR-related strategies, we looked at the BMW Group’s at-
tractiveness as an employer, employee performance and commitment, and workforce avail-
ability. The Board of Management also brought us up to date on the status of the Group’s 
diversity concepts and the extent to which targets have been achieved regarding the pro-
portion of women employed at various levels.  
In December 2022, the Supervisory Board agreed to the plan to hold the Annual General 
Meeting 2023 on a virtual basis in accordance with the regulations applicable at the time. In 
March 2023, the detailed concept proposed by the Board of Management was approved. 
With regard to the Annual General Meeting 2024, the Board of Management explained the 
reasons for its decision in favour of the virtual format to the Supervisory Board.

 Report of the Supervisory Board  
The BMW Group’s long-term business plan was the subject of comprehensive examina-
tion by the Supervisory Board. In view of the ramp-up of electric mobility in an environment 
that remains challenging and volatile, the focus was on safeguarding growth and returns. 
The Board of Management informed us about plans for the various vehicle and corporate 
segments and ambitious long-term targets, while confirming its key objectives for growth, 
market shares and profitability. We were presented with key financial indicators for each 
segment, in addition to opportunities and risks for the planning period. After thorough ex-
amination, the Supervisory Board approved the long-term business plan drawn up by the 
Board of Management.  
In December 2023, the Board of Management presented the budget for the financial year 
2024. After exhaustive discussion with the Board of Management, we gave the budget our 
approval. 
I also met with investor representatives on a regular basis to discuss topics specific to the 
Supervisory Board during the financial year 2023. We touched on corporate governance 
issues such as succession planning for the Supervisory Board, the system for the Board of 
Management’s remuneration and the future format of the Annual General Meeting as well 
as committee work and the Supervisory Board’s handling of geopolitical risks.  
With the BMW Group’s support, Supervisory Board members attended advanced training 
courses on various topics during 2023. At our July meeting held at the BMW Group’s Leip-
zig plant, the subject of which was “BMW Group Production – Electrified. Digital. Sustaina-
ble”, we discussed the topic of sustainability in production and energy generation at BMW 
Group sites. In September, we took a first in-depth look at the Group’s technology, architec-
ture and product strategy for the period as of 2025, and more closely at the strategic mod-
ules of the NEUE KLASSE. The members of the Supervisory Board then tested new BMW, 
MINI and Rolls-Royce models at the BMW M Driving Academy in Maisach. This involved a 
drive on the A8 motorway in the new BMW 5 Series sedan, where we tried out the level 2+ 
Highway Assistant. In addition, we were presented with BMW brand design vehicles, sup-
plemented by a preview of the NEUE KLASSE. A talk by a renowned Chinese economics 
expert on the state of the Chinese economy in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic and on 
opportunities for multinational corporations provided some interesting insights into the Chi-
nese market. The Supervisory Board held two hybrid meetings in October and November at 
which the heads of the responsible internal departments and an external consultant pro-
vided us with a comprehensive update on non-financial reporting and the EU taxonomy, fo-
cusing on implementation by the BMW Group. We also delved more deeply into the complex 
processes involved in implementing and reviewing the ambitious decarbonisation targets 
within the supply chain as well as the main levers for decarbonisation in this area. 
The onboarding programme for new Supervisory Board members was also continued in 
2023. As part of the programme, new members are given an insight into the BMW Group’s 
key business areas and planning processes by representatives of internal specialist depart-
ments. The programme also includes an introduction to the ongoing work of the Supervisory 
Board.  
In late 2023, we reviewed the effectiveness of the work of the Supervisory Board and its 
committees with the aid of a questionnaire, and discussed the findings in our subsequent 
meeting. Cooperation both within the Supervisory Board and with the Board of Manage-
ment was unanimously perceived as constructive and trustworthy. In the current financial 
year, we intend to act on proposals to explore certain topics in greater depth, such as bat-
tery technology and the circular economy concept.  
The Supervisory Board is careful to avoid any conflicts of interest in the course of its deliber-
ations and decision-making processes. No conflicts of interest occurred in the financial year 
2023.  
Description of Presiding Board activities and committee work  
The Supervisory Board has established a Presiding Board and four committees. At each 
subsequent Supervisory Board meeting, the Chairman of the Audit Committee, Dr Bock, 
and myself reported in detail on the work of the Presiding Committee and the other commit-
tees. Further information on the duties, composition and working methods of the Presiding 
Board as well as the various other committees is provided in the Statement of Corporate 
Governance on the BMW Group website. 
Unless a particular committee was responsible, the Presiding Board prepared the topics for 
the plenary meetings at its four meetings in cooperation with the Board of Management and 
senior heads of department. It also put forward proposals for reporting within the Supervi-
sory Board. The Presiding Board focused especially on the corporate strategy and its sus-
tainability-related aspects, in addition to longer-term corporate planning. The report on the 
BMW Group’s position was discussed in detail at every meeting of the Presiding Board. 
The Audit Committee convened eight times in total. 
In March 2023, the focus was on preparing for the Supervisory Board meeting at which the 
financial statements for the financial year 2022 were discussed and examined. After verify-
ing the matter of independence, the Audit Committee recommended to the Supervisory 
Board that PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft (“PwC”) be 
elected auditor at the Annual General Meeting 2023. There were no indications of conflicts 
of interest, grounds for exclusion or lack of independence on the part of the auditor.

 Report of the Supervisory Board  
The Audit Committee concluded that PwC’s fee proposal for the audit of the Company and 
Group Financial Statements and the BMW Group Report 2023, as well as for the review of 
the Half-Year Report 2023, was appropriate in light of the scope of its tasks. The Commit-
tee therefore issued the corresponding contracts to PwC following its election at the Annual 
General Meeting in May 2023. 
The Audit Committee also specified supplementary audit focus areas. Moreover, it approved 
the scope of the non-audit services to be performed, and received regular reports from PwC 
regarding these services. At its meetings, the Audit Committee discussed the quality of the 
audit in depth on several occasions. In particular, it received a report from the relevant de-
partment on the Group’s experience with the audit of the financial statements for the finan-
cial year 2022 and on the results of the survey conducted within the Group for this purpose. 
Based on this report, the auditor’s description of the quality assurance measures under-
taken, and the Audit Committee’s own experience with the auditor, the audit was found be 
of good quality.  
The Audit Committee also examined the combined Non-financial Statement of BMW AG 
and the BMW Group for the financial year 2022, which was part of the BMW Group Report 
2022. The Audit Committee had representatives from PwC explain the results of their audit. 
We have again engaged PwC to conduct a “limited assurance” audit of the Non-financial 
(Group) Statement for the financial year 2023, to the extent that it relates to parts of the 
management report that are not subject to a ”reasonable assurance” audit. Going beyond 
the formal review required by law, the Audit Committee also engaged PwC to audit the con-
tents of the Remuneration Report for the financial year 2023. 
The Quarterly Statements were presented to us for discussion by the Audit Committee prior 
to their publication by the Board of Management. Representatives of the external auditors 
were also present when the Half-Year Financial Report was discussed in early August 
2023. 
The Board of Management informed the Audit Committee regarding the implementation of 
the first share buyback programme (which the Audit Committee had already approved in 
2022), the redemption of the shares on 18 July 2023 and related reduction in share capital, 
as well as the second share buyback programme resolved by the Board of Management in 
May 2023. 
At its meeting in July 2023, the Audit Committee considered the effectiveness and appropri-
ateness of the BMW Group’s internal control system (including the Corporate Audit func-
tion), the compliance management system and the risk management system. In the half-
yearly risk reports, we addressed the principal risks facing the BMW Group and their classifi-
cation. We focused particularly on geopolitical risks and the resulting risk scenarios, espe-
cially for supply chains and sales markets, as well as measures to mitigate these risks. 
We also addressed the topic of climate-related risks. We regularly monitor the further devel-
opment of the internal control system for non-financial reporting with regard to the Group’s 
sustainability-related targets. 
The head of Corporate Audit presented us with the key audit findings and plans for further 
internal audits. The Chief Compliance Officer of the BMW Group reported on the structural 
development of the compliance management system, the implementation of operational 
measures and further planning. The report also addressed the implementation of the Ger-
man Supply Chain Due Diligence Act. In addition, we received a report on the BMW Group’s 
tax and customs control system from the responsible head of department. 
In its report on the audit of over-the-counter derivatives entered into by BMW AG during the 
financial year 2022, the external auditor confirmed to the Audit Committee the effectiveness 
of the system in place at BMW AG in complying with the regulatory requirements of the Eu-
ropean Market Infrastructure Regulation.  
The Audit Committee received regular reports on the state and development of significant 
legal proceedings and internal investigations and, in individual cases, discussed product- 
and emissions-related proceedings with external legal advisors brought in for that purpose.  
In its role as a preparatory body, in the course of 2023 the Personnel Committee convened 
four times to deliberate on the remuneration of, and succession planning for, the Board of 
Management. The review of the appropriateness of the Board of Management’s remunera-
tion for the financial years 2022 and 2023 and the determination of the factors for the 
Board of Management’s variable remuneration for those years were the subjects of thor-
ough preparation within the Personnel Committee. The determination of financial and ESG 
targets for the Board of Management’s remuneration for the financial year 2024 was also 
discussed in great detail. In addition, the Personnel Committee prepared for the change of 
remuneration consultant in the financial year 2023. The renewal of the anticipatory resolu-
tion on the approval of loans and transactions by BMW Bank GmbH was also on the 
agenda.  
The Nomination Committee held one meeting in the financial year 2023 in which it dis-
cussed the composition of shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board. Taking 
into account the composition requirements resolved by the Supervisory Board and the rec-
ommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code, the Nomination Committee is-
sued recommendations for the Supervisory Board’s election proposals to the Annual Gen-
eral Meeting to be held in 2024. 
The Mediation Committee, which is prescribed by law, did not need to convene during the 
financial year under report.

Composition of the Board of Management 
The Supervisory Board resolved to extend the term of office of one member and appointed 
two new members to the Board of Management in the financial year 2023.  
The Supervisory Board extended the mandate of Oliver Zipse, the Chairman of the Board of 
Management.  
Dr Nicolas Peter left the Board of Management on 11 May 2023 by mutual agreement as 
part of a succession arrangement following three decades of successful work at the BMW 
Group. As the Board of Management member responsible for Finance, he played a key role 
in shaping the development of the BMW Group with his profound expertise, entrepreneurial 
flair and vision. His work served to further cement the Group’s excellent reputation, both on 
the capital market and in the public eye. We are greatly indebted to Nicolas Peter for his out-
standing contribution.  
On 12 May 2023, Walter Mertl was appointed as member of the Board of Management re-
sponsible for Finance. He joined the BMW Group in 1998 and was most recently responsi-
ble for corporate controlling. Mr Mertl has embodied the Group’s commitment to sustainable 
profitability during the transformation for many years.  
On 31 October 2023, Pieter Nota left the Board of Management by mutual agreement, also 
in line with the BMW Group’s succession plans. After becoming the member of the Board of 
Management responsible for Customer, Brands and Sales in 2018, Mr Nota was a key fig-
ure in driving forward the sale of all-electric models and the digitalisation of the customer 
interface. He was also responsible for introducing a pioneering agency model for direct 
sales in selected markets. We wish to thank Pieter Nota for his excellent work and valuable 
inspiration.  
On 1 November 2023, Jochen Goller was appointed as member of the Board of Manage-
ment responsible for Customer, Brands and Sales. Mr Goller has been at the BMW Group 
since 1999 and has headed up activities in the China region since 2018. In Jochen Goller, 
we have appointed an internationally experienced sales manager with particular expertise in 
the Chinese market to the Board of Management. 
Composition of the Supervisory Board, the Presiding Board and the Supervisory 
Board’s committees  
There were no changes to the composition of the Supervisory Board during the past year on 
the shareholder representative side. The Annual General Meeting elected Dr Kurt Bock to 
the Supervisory Board for a further term of office of approximately four years. He was sub-
sequently appointed as Deputy Chairman of the Supervisory Board, member of the Presid-
ing Board and of the Personnel Committee as well as member and Chairman of the Audit 
Committee. 
With regard to the employee representatives, in January 2023 Dr Martin Kimmich was ap-
pointed to succeed the departing long-serving First Deputy Chairman of the Supervisory 
Board, Manfred Schoch, for his remaining term of office. Dr Kimmich has been Chairman of 
the Munich Works Council and the BMW AG Works Council since 2022. 
Disclosure of attendance at meetings by individual members 
The attendance rate at Supervisory Board meetings was 99%, and 100% for the meetings 
held by the various committees and the Presiding Board. The meetings were held in person, 
with individual members participating virtually only in justified exceptional cases. Three meet-
ings of the Audit Committee that dealt with the quarterly reports were held as hybrid meet-
ings, with individual members connected by either telephone or video call as planned. Indi-

 Report of the Supervisory Board  
Review of financial statements and the profit distribution proposal 
PwC was appointed external auditor for the financial year 2023. PwC initially conducted a 
review of the condensed Interim Group Financial Statements and the Interim Group Man-
agement Report for the first half of 2023 and presented its findings to the Audit Committee. 
No issues were identified that might indicate that the condensed Interim Group Financial 
Statements and Interim Group Management Report had not been prepared in accordance 
with the applicable provisions in all material respects. 
The Company Financial Statements and the Group Financial Statements of BMW AG for the 
financial year ended 31 December 2023, including the Combined Management Report, on 
which PwC has issued unqualified audit opinions, were authorised by the Board of Manage-
ment on 12 March 2024. These audit opinions were signed for the fifth consecutive finan-
cial year by independent auditor Petra Justenhoven (Wirtschaftsprüferin) and, for the second 
time, by Michael Popp (Wirtschaftsprüfer) as the auditor responsible for the performance of 
the engagement.  
At its meeting held on 29 February 2024, the Audit Committee initially gave in-depth con-
sideration to the preliminary version of the Company and Group Financial Statements and 
the Combined Management Report (including the combined Non-financial (Group) State-
ment and the information on the EU taxonomy) as well as the draft version of the auditor’s 
long-form reports.  
Immediately after authorising their issue, the Board of Management submitted the Com-
pany and Group Financial Statements for the financial year 2023 and the Combined Man-
agement Report (including the Combined Non-financial (Group) Statement) to the Supervi-
sory Board. The auditor’s long-form audit reports were also submitted to the Supervisory 
Board in a prompt manner. In order to facilitate preparations, drafts of these documents had 
already been made available to the Supervisory Board in advance. 
At its meeting held on 13 March 2024, the Audit Committee diligently examined and delib-
erated on these documents before they were considered in detail at the plenary session of 
the Supervisory Board on 14 March 2024.  
At the two respective meetings, the Board of Management provided a detailed explanation 
of the reporting documents submitted to the Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board. 
The representatives of the external auditor reported on the main findings of their audit and 
answered questions put to them by members of the Audit Committee and the Supervisory 
Board, partially without the presence of the members of the Board of Management. Both 
the Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board gave meticulous consideration to the key 
audit matters and the related audit procedures. 
The representatives of the external auditors confirmed that the risk management system 
established by the Board of Management is capable of identifying at an early stage any de-
velopments that might threaten the Company’s going-concern status. They also confirmed 
that no material weaknesses in the internal control system and risk management system 
were identified with regard to the financial reporting process. 
In the course of their audit work, they did not identify any facts inconsistent with the con-
tents of the Declaration of Compliance pursuant to § 161 of the German Stock Corporation 
Act (AktG) jointly issued by the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board. 
Based on a thorough examination conducted by the Audit Committee and the Supervisory 
Board, we concurred with the results of the external audit. In accordance with the final result 
of this examination, no objections were raised. At our meeting held on 14 March 2024, we 
accordingly approved the Group and Company Financial Statements of BMW AG for the fi-
nancial year 2023. The Company Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 
2023 have therefore been adopted. 
Furthermore, in both the Audit Committee and the full Supervisory Board, we examined the 
Board of Management’s proposal to use the unappropriated profit to pay a dividend of 
€ 6.00 for each share of common stock entitled to receive a dividend and € 6.02 for each 
share of preferred stock entitled to receive a dividend and to transfer the remaining amount 
to other revenue reserves. We consider the proposal appropriate and have therefore ap-
proved it. 
Based on the preparatory work of the Audit Committee, the Supervisory Board and the 
Board of Management jointly prepared the Remuneration Report for the financial year 2023 
in accordance with § 162 AktG. At the request of the Audit Committee, PwC reviewed the 
contents of the Remuneration Report, reported to both the Audit Committee and the Super-
visory Board on the results of the review, and confirmed that the Remuneration Report com-
plies with the financial reporting provisions contained in § 162 AktG in all material respects.  
The Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board also carefully examined the combined 
Non-financial (Group) Statement for the year ended 31 December 2023. Following an in-
depth explanation of the statement by the Board of Management, representatives of PwC 
presented the key findings of their audit and answered additional questions posed by the 
members of the Supervisory Board. Based on the “limited assurance” audit performed by 
PwC on those parts of the Management Report and certain sustainability disclosures in the 
integrated BMW Group Report 2023 that were not subject to a reasonable assurance en-
gagement, PWC issued an unqualified opinion, signed for the second time by Michael Popp 
(Wirtschaftsprüfer) and for the first time by Annette Fink.

Group Chairman’s statement
The past year brought unprecedented challenges, but our 
people responded exceptionally well and our performance  
has been resilient.
helped ensure our customers received the 
support they needed – all the while managing 
their own, at times extremely difficult, 
situations at home. On behalf of the Board, I 
would like to express my deepest thanks to 
them all for the exceptional way they are 
responding to these most challenging 
circumstances. 
Against this backdrop, HSBC demonstrated a 
resilient performance. Reported profit before 
tax was $8.8bn, a fall of 34%, and adjusted 
profit before tax was $12.1bn, down 45%. 
Within this, Global Banking and Markets 
performed particularly well, while Asia was 
once again by far the most profitable region. 
Deposits also increased significantly across 
the Group, reinforcing the strength of our 
funding and liquidity positions.
In response to a request from the UK’s 
Prudential Regulation Authority, we cancelled 
the fourth interim dividend for 2019. We also 
announced that, until the end of 2020, we 
would make no quarterly or interim dividend 
payments or accruals in respect of ordinary 
shares. This was a difficult decision and we 
deeply regret the impact it has had on our 
shareholders. We are therefore pleased to 
restart dividend payments at the earliest 
opportunity. The Board has announced an 
interim dividend of $0.15 for 2020, and 
adopted a policy designed to provide 
sustainable dividends in the future.
Board of Directors
The confirmation of Noel Quinn as permanent 
Group Chief Executive underlined the Board’s 
belief that he is the best person to lead  
the delivery of the strategic plan. We look  
forward to working closely with Noel and  
the management team as they focus on 
executing our strategic priorities in 2021.
Jamie Forese, Steve Guggenheimer and  
Eileen Murray joined the Board as independent 
non-executive Directors in 2020. All three  
have already demonstrated the valuable skills, 
expertise and experience they bring across  
a wide range of areas, including technology. 
We have also announced that Dame Carolyn 
Fairbairn will join the Board as an independent 
non-executive Director. Carolyn will bring  
a wealth of relevant experience, and her 
appointment will be effective from  
1 September 2021.

In 2020, we experienced economic and 
social upheaval on a scale unseen in 
living memory. Even before the year 
began, the external environment was 
being reshaped by a range of factors 
– including the impact of trade tensions 
between the US and China, Brexit, low 
interest rates and rapid technological 
development. The spread of the Covid-19 
virus made that environment all the more 
complex and challenging.
The Covid-19 pandemic has severely impacted 
our customers, our colleagues, our 
shareholders and the communities we serve. 
The first priority was, and remains, dealing 
with the public health crisis, but the economic 
crisis that unfolded simultaneously has also 
been unprecedented in recent times. The 
financial services industry has been at the 
forefront of helping businesses and individuals 
through the difficulties they have faced, 
working with governments and regulators 
towards expected recovery and future growth. 
I am enormously proud of the professionalism, 
dedication and energy that my colleagues 
around the world have demonstrated as they 

--- Page 9 ---
Group Chairman’s statement
“ There are many 
opportunities ahead  
for a bank with HSBC’s 
competitive strengths.”
As reported in the Annual Report and 
Accounts 2019, Sir Jonathan Symonds and 
Kathleen Casey retired from the Board last 
year. Today we also announced that Laura Cha 
will step down from the Board immediately 
after our 2021 Annual General Meeting 
(‘AGM’) in May. I would like to thank  
Jon, Kathy and Laura for the enormous 
contributions they made to HSBC during their 
years of service. We are now in the advanced 
stages of a search for suitable candidates  
to join and strengthen the Board, and I will 
update further on the outcome of this search 
in due course.
Like the rest of the Group, the Board had to 
adapt its ways of working in 2020. We met 
virtually for much of the year, which brought 
benefits including less travel and more 
frequent, shorter meetings. It will be important 
for us to consider how we retain what has 
worked well over the last year once restrictions 
are lifted and it becomes possible to travel 
once again.
The Board enjoys the constructive discussions 
that we have with shareholders at the AGM in 
the UK and the Informal Shareholders’ 
Meeting in Hong Kong, so it was a matter of 
regret that we did not meet in person in 2020. 
While we did maintain regular contact with 
shareholders throughout the year, we will 
resume our face-to-face engagement with 
shareholders in the UK, Hong Kong and more 
widely, as soon as is practicable.
External environment
After the significant deterioration in global 
economic conditions in the first half of the year 
due to the Covid-19 pandemic, there were 
signs of improvement in the second half, 
especially in Asia. The most impressive 
economic recovery has been in China – still 
the biggest driver of global growth – where 
international trade is rebounding most 
strongly. The signing of the Regional 
Comprehensive Economic Partnership should 
further boost intra-regional activity across 
Asia, while the recent political agreement 
between the EU and China on an investment 
deal should, once ratified, bolster the already 
significant two-way investment flows.
Covid-19 infection levels remain very high in 
Europe, the US and Latin America, and new 
variants of the virus have spread quickly. This 
has necessitated new lockdown measures  
in the UK and other countries. While the 
deployment of multiple vaccines means we 
are more optimistic about the future, there is 
clearly still some way to go before life can 
return to something like normality. Recovery 
will therefore take longer in these economies, 
with growth more likely later in 2021 in  
these economies.
The agreement of a trade deal between the  
UK and EU prior to the end of 2020 provides 
some certainty for cross-border trade. 
However, the reduced access for financial 
services under these new arrangements 
means that further work is needed to maintain 
the level playing field that has existed until 
now. Given the many benefits that the UK 
financial services industry brings to the UK 
and EU economies, equivalence must be a  
key priority for both parties.
The geopolitical environment remains 
challenging – in particular for a global bank  
like HSBC – and we continue to be mindful  
of the potential impact that it could have on 
our strategy. We continue to engage fully  
and frequently with all governments as we 
seek to do everything we possibly can to  
help our customers navigate an increasingly 
complex world.
Capturing future opportunities
Given the external environment, it is vital  
we stay focused on what we can control.  
The Board is confident there are many 
opportunities ahead for a bank with HSBC’s 
competitive strengths. This makes it all the 
more important that we position ourselves  
to capture them.
While we prioritised supporting our customers 
and our people during the pandemic, we 
made good progress against the three 
strategic priorities announced in February 
2020 – reallocating capital from 
underperforming parts of the business, 
reducing costs and simplifying the 
organisation. In particular, the Board worked 
closely with the management team over the 
course of the year on plans to accelerate 
progress and investment in key areas of 
growth, which include our Asian franchise,  
our wealth business and new technology 
across the Group. 
We are today unveiling the outcome of 
extensive consultation with our people and 
customers on the Group’s purpose and values. 
Being clear about who we are, what we stand 
for and how this connects to our strategy is an 
important part of how we align and energise 
the organisation to create long-term value for 
all those we work with and for – our investors, 
customers, employees, suppliers and the 
communities we serve. The Board fully 
endorses the outcome of this work.
Our commitment to create sustainable value is 
demonstrated by the new climate ambitions 
we announced in October 2020. The most 
significant contribution that HSBC can make 
to the fight against climate change is to bring 
our customers with us on the transition to a 
low-carbon future. Our goal of being net zero 
for our financed emissions by 2050 sends an 
important signal to our investors, our 
customers and our people – if our clients are 
prepared to change their business models and 
make that transition, we will help and support 
them to do so. HSBC was also delighted to be 
one of the founding signatories of the Terra 
Carta, which was launched last month by HRH 
The Prince of Wales’ Sustainable Markets 
Initiative. Further details about all of the steps 
we are taking towards a more sustainable 
future are set out in the ESG review, which for 
the first time is included within the Annual 
Report and Accounts 2020.
Finally, 2020 underlined once again that  
our people are the driving force behind  
our business. I would like to reiterate how 
enormously grateful I am to my colleagues for 
the great dedication and care they showed to 
our customers and to each other during such 
testing times. Further empowering and 
enabling them to do their jobs and execute  
our strategic priorities is the key to our  
future success.

Strategic report 
Group Chief Executive’s review
With a blueprint for the future and a renewed purpose to guide us, 
we are building a dynamic, efficient and agile global bank with a 
digital-first mindset, capable of providing a world-leading service 
to our customers and strong returns for our investors.
digital capabilities – both in 2020 and in 
previous years – enabled our customers to 
access more services remotely, and we 
worked closely with our regulators around the 
world to open new digital channels in a safe 
and secure way. In total, we provided more 
than $26bn of relief to our personal customers 
and more than $52bn to our wholesale 
customers, both through government 
schemes and our own relief initiatives. We also 
played a vital role in keeping capital flowing for 
our clients, arranging more than $1.9tn of loan, 
debt and equity financing for our wholesale 
customers during 2020.
Even in the middle of the pandemic, we 
continued to look to the future. In October, we 
announced our ambition to become a net zero 
bank by 2050, supporting customers through 
the transition to a low-carbon economy and 
helping to unlock next-generation climate 
solutions. If the Covid-19 pandemic provided a 
shock to the system, a climate crisis has the 
potential to be much more drastic in its 
consequences and longevity. We are therefore 
stepping up support for our clients in a material 
way, working together to build a thriving 
low-carbon economy and focusing our 
business on helping achieve that goal.
The actions we outlined in February 2020  
are largely on track or ahead of where  
we intended them to be, despite the 
complications of the pandemic. We renewed 
and re-energised the senior management 
team, with around three-quarters of the Group 
Executive Committee in post for just over a 
year or less. Our business is more streamlined 
than it was a year ago, with three global 
businesses instead of four and increased 
back-office consolidation. Costs are down 
materially, with over $1bn of gross operating 
costs removed during 2020. We are also 
already more than half-way towards our target 
to reduce at least $100bn of gross risk-
weighted assets by 2022. Unfortunately, the 
changed interest-rate environment means  
we are no longer able to achieve a return  
on tangible equity of 10% to 12% by 2022.  
We will now target a return on tangible equity 
of 10% or above over the medium term.
The world around us changed significantly  
in 2020. Central bank interest rates in many 
countries fell to record lows. Pandemic-related 
lockdowns led to a rapid acceleration in the 
shift from physical to digital banking. Like 
many businesses, we learned that our people 
could be just as productive working from

In 2020, HSBC had a very clear mandate 
– to provide stability in a highly unstable 
environment for our customers, 
communities and colleagues. I believe  
we achieved that in spite of the many 
challenges presented by the Covid-19 
pandemic and heightened geopolitical 
uncertainty.
Our people delivered an exceptional level  
of support for our customers in very tough 
circumstances, while our strong balance sheet 
and liquidity gave reassurance to those who 
rely on us. We achieved this while delivering  
a solid financial performance in the context  
of the pandemic – particularly in Asia – and 
laying firm foundations for our future growth.  
I am proud of everything our people achieved 
and grateful for the loyalty of our customers 
during a very turbulent year.
2020
Helping our customers emerge from the 
Covid-19 pandemic in a sustainable position 
was our most pressing priority. We did this by 
equipping our colleagues to work from home 
at the height of the pandemic, and keeping the 
vast majority of our branches and all of our 
contact centres open. Our investment in our

home as in the office. Also, as the world 
resolved to build back responsibly from the 
pandemic, governments, businesses and 
customers united to accelerate a low-carbon 
transition that works for all.
All of these things caused us to adjust and 
reinforce elements of our strategy to fit this 
new environment. The growth plans that we 
have developed are a natural progression of 
our February 2020 plans. They aim to play to 
our strengths, especially in Asia; to accelerate 
our technology investment plans to deliver 
better customer service and increased 
productivity; to energise our business for 
growth; and to invest further in our own 
low-carbon transition and that of our 
customers. They are also designed to  
deliver a 10% return on tangible equity over  
the medium term in the current low interest-
rate environment.
Our purpose
As we charted the next stage of HSBC’s 
journey, we also reflected on our purpose as a 
business. We consulted widely both internally 
and externally, speaking to thousands of 
colleagues and customers, and looked deeply 
into our history. The same themes came up 
again and again.
HSBC has always focused on helping 
customers pursue the opportunities around 
them, whether as individuals or businesses. 
Sometimes those opportunities are clear and 
visible, and sometimes they are far from 
obvious. Sometimes they arise in the next 
street, and sometimes on the next continent. 
Sometimes they exist in the status quo, and 
sometimes they are a product of great social 
or economic change. But always, they 
represent a chance for our customers to grow 
and to help those close to them – protecting, 
nurturing, building.
‘Opening up a world of opportunity’ both 
captures this aim and lays down a challenge 
for the future. Opportunity never stands still. It 
changes and evolves with the world around 
us. It is our job to keep making the most of it, 
and to find and capture it with a spirit of 
entrepreneurialism, innovation and 
internationalism that represents HSBC at its 
very best. This is the essence of what our 
plans intend to deliver, and what we intend to 
keep delivering for our customers, colleagues 
and communities as we navigate change and 
complexity together. 
Financial performance
The pandemic inevitably affected our 2020 
financial performance. The shutdown of much 
of the global economy in the first half of the 
year caused a large rise in expected credit 
losses, and cuts in central bank interest rates 
reduced revenue in rate-sensitive business 
lines. We responded by accelerating the 
transformation of the Group, further reducing 
our operating costs and moving our focus 
from interest-rate sensitive business lines 
towards fee-generating businesses. Our 
expected credit losses stabilised in the second 
half of the year in line with the changed 
economic outlook, but the revenue 
environment remained muted.
As a consequence, the Group delivered 
$8.8bn of reported profit before tax, down 
34% on 2019, and $12.1bn of adjusted profits, 
down 45%. Our Asia business was again the 
major contributor, delivering $13bn of adjusted 
profit before tax in 2020.
Adjusted revenue was 8% lower than in 2019. 
This was due mainly to the impact of interest 
rate cuts at the start of the year on our deposit 
franchises in all three global businesses. By 
contrast, our Global Markets business 
benefited from increased customer activity 
due to market volatility throughout the year, 
growing adjusted revenue by 27%.
We made strong progress in reducing our 
operating expenses. A combination of our 
cost-saving programmes, cuts in 
performance-related pay and lower 
discretionary spending due to the Covid-19 
pandemic helped to reduce our adjusted 
operating expenses by $1.1bn or 3%.

Strategic report | Group Chief Executive’s review
Response to Covid-19
Our operations have stayed highly 
resilient and we are participating in 
several Covid-19 relief measures.
Approximately 
85% 
of our employees are now equipped to work 
from home.
We provided over 
$26bn 
of relief to our personal customers.
Our investment plans remain essential to the 
future of the business. We continued to invest 
heavily in technology while managing costs 
down, spending $5.5bn during 2020.
Our funding, liquidity and capital remain 
strong. We grew deposits by $173bn on a 
constant currency basis, with increases across 
all three global businesses. Our common 
equity tier one ratio was 15.9% on 31 
December 2020.
Our shareholders
It was a difficult year for our shareholders.  
The Covid-19 pandemic and the impact of 
geopolitics weighed heavily on our share price 
throughout 2020. In March, we cancelled the 
payment of our fourth interim dividend for 2019 
at the request of our lead regulator, and also 
agreed not to make any quarterly or interim 
dividend payments until the end of 2020. This 
particularly affected shareholders who rely on 
our dividend for income. It was a priority for the 
management team to get back to being able to 
pay dividends by the end of the year, and we 
were pleased to be able to recommend the 
payment of an interim dividend for 2020.
10
Dividends are hugely important, but so is 
capacity for growth. To deliver both, we are 
adopting a new policy designed to provide 
sustainable dividends, offering good income 
while giving management the flexibility to 
reinvest capital to grow the firm over the 
medium term. We will consider share 
buy-backs, over time and not in the near term, 
where no immediate opportunity for capital 
redeployment exists. We will also no longer 
offer a scrip dividend option, and will pay 
dividends entirely in cash. 
The last 12 months were tough, but I am highly 
focused on turning our performance around in 
2021 and beyond. I strongly believe that the 
combination of our growth plans and our new 
dividend policy will unlock greater value for our 
shareholders in the years to come.
Opening up a world of opportunity
‘Opening up a world of opportunity’ is more 
than a purpose – it is a statement of intent. 
Everything that we plan to do over the next 
decade is designed to unlock opportunity  
for our stakeholders, whether customers, 
colleagues, shareholders or communities.  
We intend to do this by building a dynamic, 
efficient and agile global bank with a 
digital-first mindset, capable of providing  
a world-leading service to our customers and 
strong returns for our investors. We will also 
need to focus intently on the areas where  
we excel, and to foster a commercial and 
entrepreneurial culture with a conviction to get 
things done. We believe we can achieve this in 
four ways.
First, we plan to focus on and invest in the 
areas in which we are strongest. In Wealth 
and Personal Banking, we aim to become a 
market-leader for high net worth and ultra high 
net worth clients in Asia and the Asian 
diaspora, and to invest in our biggest retail 
markets where the opportunity is greatest. In 
Commercial Banking, we want to remain a 
global leader in cross-border trade, and to lead 
the world in serving mid-market corporates 
internationally. In Global Banking and Markets, 
we intend to invest to capture trade and capital 
flows into and across Asia, while connecting 
global clients to Asia and the Middle East 
through our international network.
everything that we want to achieve. It is how 
we intend to win new customers and retain 
them, to become more agile and efficient, to 
create richer, seamless customer journeys, 
and to build strong and innovative 
partnerships that deliver excellent benefits  
for our customers. We have an opportunity  
to meet the growing market need for 
sophisticated, robust and rapid payment 
solutions, and to lead our industry in applying 
digital solutions to analogue services, such as 
trade. We therefore intend to protect 
technology investment throughout the cycle, 
even as we reduce spending elsewhere.
Third, we want to energise HSBC for growth 
through a strong culture, simple ways of 
working, and by equipping our colleagues 
with the future skills they need. Giving life to 
our purpose will be critical to building the 
dynamic, entrepreneurial and inclusive culture 
that we want to create, as will removing the 
remaining structural barriers that sometimes 
stop our people from delivering for our 
customers. We need to change the way we 
hire to build skills and capabilities in areas that 
are different to what we have needed 
historically, including data, artificial 
intelligence, and sustainable business models. 
Our expanded HSBC University will also help 
to upskill and reskill our people, while fostering 
more of the softer skills that technology can 
never replace.
Fourth, we will seek to help our customers and 
communities to capture the opportunities 
presented by the transition to a low-carbon 
economy. Accelerating this transition is the 
right thing to do for the environment, but also 
the right thing commercially. We intend to 
build on our market-leading position in 
sustainable finance, supporting our clients 
with $750bn to $1tn of sustainable financing 
and investment over the next 10 years. We 
also intend to unlock new climate solutions by 
building one of the world’s leading climate 
managers – HSBC Pollination Climate Asset 
Management – and helping to transform 
sustainable infrastructure into a global asset 
class. These will help us achieve our ambition 
to align our portfolio of financed emissions to 
the Paris Agreement goal to achieve net zero 
by 2050.
Second, we intend to increase the pace at 
which we digitise HSBC through higher levels 
of technology investment. This underpins 
Championing inclusion
I believe passionately in building an inclusive 
organisation in which everyone has the 

--- Page 13 ---
Group Chief Executive’s review
” I believe passionately

organisation in which 
everyone has the 
opportunity to fulfil  
their potential”
opportunity to fulfil their potential. Failing to do 
so isn’t just wrong, it is totally self-defeating. It 
means you don’t get the best out of the talent 
you have, and sends the wrong signals to the 
people you want to recruit. An inclusive 
environment is the foundation of a truly 
diverse organisation, with all of the rewards 
that brings.
There is much still to do, but we are moving in 
the right direction. More than 30% of our 
senior leaders are female, in line with the goal 
we set to achieve by the end of 2020. I want 
that number to increase to at least 35% by 
2025, and we have a number of initiatives in 
place to help achieve it. In May, we launched a 
new global ethnicity inclusion programme to 
better enable careers and career progression 
for colleagues from ethnic minorities, and in 
July, we made a series of commitments to 
address feedback from Black colleagues in 
particular. These included a commitment to 
more than double our number of Black senior 
leaders by 2025.
I am particularly proud that during a difficult 
year, which included a large-scale redundancy 
programme, employee sentiment improved 
within HSBC. Around 71% of my colleagues 
said that they found HSBC to be a great place 
to work, up from 66% in 2019. However, the 
view varies across employees from different 
groups. We know, for example, that 
employees with disabilities or who identify as 
ethnic minorities do not feel as engaged as 
others. I take these gaps very seriously.  
Better demographic data globally will help us 
benchmark and measure our progress more 
effectively, and we are taking concerted steps 
to be able to capture that information  
where possible. 
2021 outlook
We have had a good start to 2021, and I am 
cautiously optimistic for the year ahead. While a 
spike in Covid-19 infection rates led to renewed 
lockdown measures in many places at the start 
of 2021, the development of multiple vaccines 
gives us hope that the world will return to some 
form of normality before long. Nonetheless, we 
remain reactive to the ebb and flow of the 
Covid-19 virus and prepared to take further 
steps to manage the economic impact  
where necessary.
The geopolitical uncertainty that prevailed 
during 2020 remains a prominent feature of 
our operating environment. We are hopeful 
that this will reduce over the course of 2021, 
but mindful of the potential impact on our 
business if levels remain elevated. We remain 
focused on serving the needs of our 
customers, colleagues and communities in all 
our markets.
Our people
I would like to pay tribute to my colleagues 
and all those who supported them throughout 
a difficult year. HSBC is a community of 
around 226,000 colleagues – but it relies just 
as much on the family, friends and support 
networks that help them be the best they can 
be. Our people did extraordinary things in 
2020, but it asked a lot of those around them. I 
am hugely grateful to everyone who helped 
HSBC – whether directly or indirectly – in 
supporting our customers, communities and 
each other over the last 12 months.

Strategic report
Our strategy
Our strategy
With continued delivery against our February 2020 commitments, we 
are now in the next stage of our strategic plan, which responds to the 
significant shifts during the year and aligns to our refreshed purpose, 
values and ambition. 
Progress on our 2020 commitments
In February 2020, we outlined our plan to 
upgrade our returns profile through recycling 
risk-weighted assets (‘RWAs’) out of low-
return franchises into higher-performing ones, 
reducing our cost base and streamlining  
our organisation.
we outlined. We delivered $1bn of cost 
programme saves. We also reduced gross 
RWAs by $52bn, including $24bn from our 
non-ring-fenced bank in Europe and the UK, 
and are currently on track to meet the greater 
than $100bn target outlined by 2022. 
During 2020, in spite of significant headwinds 
posed by the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak 
across our network, we made significant 
progress on delivering against the ambitions 
We took bold steps to simplify our 
organisation, including the merger of Retail 
Banking and Wealth Management and Global 
Private Banking to form Wealth and Personal 
Banking. We also reduced management layers 
in Global Banking and Markets and our 
non-ring-fenced bank in Europe and the UK. 
We have built a strong capital position, ending 
the year with a CET1 ratio of 15.9%. Our return 
on tangible equity (‘RoTE’) of 3.1% was 
negatively impacted by the Covid-19 outbreak 
and the challenging macroeconomic 
environment, including lower interest rates 
and higher expected credit losses. 
Responding to the new environment 
There was a set of fundamental shifts in 2020 that profoundly impacted our organisation as well as the wider financial services sector. We have 
adapted our strategy accordingly.
Low interest-rate environment
Interest rates are expected to remain lower for 
longer, resulting in a more difficult revenue 
environment for the financial services sector.
The new digital experience economy
Remote working and global lockdowns due to 
the Covid-19 outbreak have increased our 
customers’ propensity and preference to 
engage digitally.
Increased focus on sustainability 
The demand for sustainable solutions and 
green finance rose to new highs in 2020.

Our strategy
Shifting capital to areas with the highest returns and growth
We are responding to the changes in our 
operating environment, and building on our 
2020 commitments. Our strategy includes 
accelerating the shift of capital to areas, 
principally Asia and wealth, that have 
demonstrated the highest returns and where 
we have sustainable advantage through scale. 
Our international network remains a key 
competitive advantage and we will continue to 
support cross-border banking flows between 
major trade corridors. Supported by these 
shifts, we are aiming to reach mid-single-digit 
revenue growth in the medium to long term1, 
with a higher proportion of our revenue 
coming from fee and insurance income.

We have increased our 2022 cost reduction target by $1bn and we plan to keep costs stable from 2022. We also plan to reduce tangible equity in the 
US and in our non-ring-fenced-bank in Europe and the UK, and increase tangible equity in Asia and in Wealth and Personal Banking. Dividends could 
be supplemented by buy-backs or special dividends, over time and not in the near term4. We will also no longer offer a scrip dividend option, and will 
pay dividends entirely in cash. Given the significant changes in our operating environment during 2020, we no longer expect to reach our RoTE target 
of between 10% and 12% in 2022 as originally planned.

Strategic report | Our strategy
Our strategy
We have embedded our purpose, values and ambition into our strategy. Our purpose is ‘Opening up a world of opportunity’. Our values are: 
we value difference; we succeed together; we take responsibility; and we get it done. Our ambition is to be the preferred international financial 
partner for our clients. Our strategy centres around four key areas: focus on our areas of strengths; digitise at scale to adapt our operating 
model for the future; energise our organisation for growth; and support the transition to a net zero global economy.
Focus on our strengths
In our global businesses 
In each of our global businesses, we will focus on areas where we are strongest and have significant opportunities for growth. We aim to invest 
approximately $6bn in Asia1, where we intend to drive double-digit growth in profit before tax in the region in the medium to long term2.
Wealth and Personal Banking
Our goal is to lead in wealth, with a particular 
focus on Asia and the Middle East, while 
investing in our largest retail markets such as 
Hong Kong and the UK. Over the medium to 
long term, we intend to grow wealth revenue 
at more than 10% compound annual growth 
rate, and grow Asia wealth assets under 
management faster than the market. In 
support of these ambitions, we aim to: capture 
opportunities to serve high and ultra high net 
worth segments across Asia, especially in 
China, south-east Asia, Hong Kong and 
Singapore; deploy our manufacturing 
capabilities at scale in insurance and asset 
management; and build propositions that 
facilitate client origination from our wholesale 
businesses. 
Commercial Banking
Taking advantage of our international 
network, we aspire to lead in supporting 
cross-border trade and in serving mid-market 
corporates globally. We plan to accelerate 
international client acquisition and deepen our 
share of wallet in cross-border services. We 
aim to develop front-end ecosystems to drive 
international mid-market client acquisition at 
scale. We plan to improve SME propositions 
in key markets with digital sales and service 
journeys. We will also continue to invest in 
our front-end platforms for Global Liquidity 
and Cash Management, Global Trade and 
Receivables Finance and Foreign Exchange to 
drive more fee income and accelerate our 
asset distribution. 
Global Banking and Markets
We will continue to invest in Global Banking and 
Markets as a leading international bank in Asia 
and the Middle East, with a global network to 
support trade and capital flows. We aim to 
invest in areas such as: enhancing digital 
platforms for our Asia wealth propositions, 
including structured products and foreign 
exchange; market access and execution 
capabilities in Global Markets and Securities 
Services; and expansion of our investment 
banking coverage across Asia. The next five 
years should see Global Banking and Markets 
pivot to a less volatile and higher-returns model, 
relying less on our balance sheet, and focusing 
more on the growing capital markets 
opportunity in Asia and the Middle East.

Continued execution of our transformation programme
To help create capacity for growth, we are refocusing our US business, our non-ring-fenced bank in Europe and the UK, and our Global 
Banking and Markets business.
A focused international business in the US
We will continue to invest in our substantial 
corporate and institutional franchise in the US 
over the medium to long term, including taking 
actions to further increase international 
connectivity and revenue in other geographies 
where HSBC and our US client base have a 
strong presence around the world including 
Asia, the Middle East, the UK and continental 
Europe. We continue to explore strategic 
options with respect to our US retail franchise, 
looking to focus on our high net worth, Jade 
and Premier client base and wealth 
management products, while reviewing other 
options in respect of our retail banking 
presence. 
Our non-ring-fenced bank in Europe and 
the UK
Our non-ring-fenced bank will focus on a 
wholesale footprint that serves international 
customers both outbound and inbound within 
our network. We intend to continue investing in 
our transaction banking franchise that has 
strong linkage to Asia. We are continuing with 
the strategic review of our retail banking 
operations in France and are in negotiations in 
relation to a potential sale, although no decision 
has yet been taken. If any sale is implemented, 
given the underlying performance of the French 
retail business, a loss on sale is expected. We 
simplified our operating model, with shared 
services between our two hubs in London and 
Paris. We plan to continue reducing complexity 
in our RWA and cost consumption, and we aim 
to reduce costs5 by approximately 20% by 2022. 
Our Global Banking and Markets business
Our Global Banking and Markets business will 
refocus on Asia and the Middle East. We aim 
to be the pre-eminent corporate and 
investment bank in Asia, focusing on 
opportunities such as the regionalisation of 
trade and capital flows and the rise in wealth 
creation. We will focus on serving clients into 
and within Asia and the Middle East, and 
providing global institutions with access to 
developed and emerging markets. We are 
redeploying capital and moving centres of 
excellence in Global Markets and Global 
Banking closer to clients in Asia as we  
allocate investments to the region.

Our strategy
Digitise at scale
We plan to grow investments1 at a compound 
annual growth rate of approximately 7% to 
10% from 2019 to 2022. We will focus our 
investments in areas such as technology to 
improve our customers’ digital experiences 
while ensuring security and resilience. These 
investments will be funded in part by using 
technology to drive down costs, including a 
reduction in manual client processes and a 
reduction in our commercial real estate 
footprint.
Investing in technology
We aim to deliver excellent customer 
experience throughout our network,  
including through the use of straight-through 
processing for payments, and through 
partnerships with big technology firms and 
fintechs for innovation support. We also 
intend to build platforms for higher front-end 
productivity, including arming our front-line 
staff with data analytics and visualisation for 
key insights. We plan to automate our middle 
and back office by, for example, integrating 
machine-learning to improve analytics 
capabilities. We also plan to build solutions to 
Energise for growth 
We are moving to a leaner and simpler 
organisation that is energised and fit for  
the future. 
Inspire a dynamic culture 
We intend to re-energise our culture to 
succeed with purpose and bring our values  
to life. We also aim to adopt future ways of 
working. To support these objectives, we 
secured inputs from approximately 120,000 
colleagues and engaged with over 2,500 
customers to help shape our renewed purpose 
and values, which have been embedded into 
our strategy. Furthermore, we are launching 
new leadership expectations that help to: give 
life to our purpose; unleash our organisation’s 
potential; and see through our actions.  
Transition to net zero 
Our ambition is to support the transition to a 
net zero global economy. 
Becoming a net zero bank
We are making changes both in our own 
operations and for our customers through  
our financing portfolio. We aim to bring our 
operations and supply chain to net zero by 
2030 or sooner. We also plan to align our 
financed emissions – the carbon emissions  
of our portfolio of customers – to the Paris 
Agreement goal to achieve net zero by 2050  
or sooner.

(including build-out of front-line staff), and other 
strategic, regulatory, and technology investment 
(including amortisation).
Champion inclusion
We aim to increase diverse representation, 
particularly in the senior levels of our 
organisation. In 2020, we achieved more than 
30% of female senior leadership, and we 
intend to increase to more than 35% by 2025. 
We endeavour to close the gaps in employee 
engagement in under-represented groups. We 
are also focusing on the quality and reporting 
of ethnicity data and benchmarking our 
actions. Our progress to date includes race 
commitments to at least double the number of 
Black employees in senior leadership roles 
globally by 2025 and recognition within 
Stonewall’s 2020 Top Global Employers Index 
for LGBT+ staff. 
Develop future skills
To energise our colleagues, we are setting out 
initiatives to help develop their future skills and 
capabilities. We aim to deepen the prevalence 
of digital, professional and enabling skills 
across the organisation. Our accomplishments 
to date include expanding HSBC University 
courses on future skills, digitalisation and 
sustainability. Moreover, we are deploying 
third-party platforms such as Degreed, for 
educational technology, and Gloat, for career 
development.
Supporting our customers
Our aim is to provide between $750bn and 
$1tn of sustainable finance and investment by 
2030 to support our customers in their 
transition to lower carbon emissions.
We address the progress made on our 
commitments in a number of different sections 
of this Annual Report and Accounts 2020 and 
beyond. For more information on our climate 
strategy, please refer to the below.
Unlocking new climate solutions 
We are working with a range of partners to 
increase investment in natural resources, clean 
technology and sustainable infrastructure. We 
also plan to donate $100m to a programme 
that will support climate solutions to scale over 
the next five years.

about Toyota’s strategy for achieving carbon neutrality—
The Toyota bZ means going “beyond Zero.”
particularly our strategy for battery electric vehicles, 
which represent one of the most promising options.
I believe that achieving carbon neutrality means 
realizing a world in which all people living on this 
planet continue to live happily. We want to help realize 
such a world. This has been and will continue to be 
Freedom of movement and fun to drive for all. Our 
goal is not only to reduce CO2 emissions and other 
negative impacts to zero. Our goal goes beyond that.
For the bZ series, we developed a dedicated platform 
for battery EVs to meet the diverse needs of the 
global market.
And, this is the most compact SUV in the series—a 
small battery EV with a comfortable interior designed 
with Europe and Japan in mind.

What do you think? We will not only add battery EV 
options to existing vehicle models but will also offer 
a full lineup of reasonably priced mass-production

the next generation a beautiful Earth in which everyone can live more happily, we have accelerated 
investment in initiatives aimed at achieving carbon neutrality as well as those related to CASE 
technologies, including Woven City. The continuation of these endeavors is, we believe, only 
possible due to stakeholder support. We hereby extend our wholehearted gratitude to all 
our stakeholders.
Our total sales over the past 12 years reached 300 trillion yen. However, the automotive industry 
has a broad supply chain. About 70 percent of the parts we use are purchased from suppliers, 
meaning that about 70 percent of our sales income can be attributed to what we paid for such 
parts. The cumulative total of these payments to suppliers is about 230 trillion yen. Considering 
that the annual national budget of Japan is 100 trillion yen, I think we can say that a consider-
able amount of money was made outside of Toyota. In addition, the consolidated number of 
employees increased by 50,000 to 370,000.
I believe that I was able to continue as president because of various crises. One after another, 
we have dealt with “once-in-a-century” crises, such as our fall into the red due to the global 
financial crisis, followed by the recall crisis, the U.S. Congressional hearings, and the Great 
East Japan Earthquake. I believe that it is precisely due to these crises that Toyota—and me as 
its president—have endured to this day. It is due to these crises that more and more of my 
Toyota colleagues started to listen to my perspective and to try to change.
Over the past 12 years, my colleagues and I have tirelessly taken action and faced reality 
together with those in the genba (on the front lines), trying to find the way forward through an 
uncharted world, working toward our mission of determining how Toyota should be.

the best in town. Our goal is to be the most trusted, most loved company in the towns where 
we operate. The idea is to work to bring smiles to the faces of the people in the towns we serve.
Toyota’s Mission of “Producing Happiness for All”
With the CASE revolution, I believe that the cars of the future will be connected to communities 
and people’s lives through information, becoming part of our social systems.
Amid this changing landscape, we are striving to completely redesign ourselves as a mobility 
company and ambitiously working to create an “ever-better mobility society” in which people 
can live happily, with smiles on their faces.
As an automobile company, our history is one of manufacturing industrial products. Uniformity 
in our workforce was necessary for this work, because it is important to produce consistent 
quality regardless of the product or who is working on it. However, the needs of customers and 
society are becoming more diverse, and, going forward, mobility will need to offer attractive 
performance in terms of both hardware and software. Under such circumstances, I feel that 
human resources with diverse values and abilities are increasingly important. I also believe that 
such a diverse and talented workforce will be the driving force behind innovation.

bringing negative things forward to the future. Those working on future-oriented tasks are using 
the strength generated by the work on the present and the past to take on new challenges—
making mistakes along the way—to push forward into uncharted territory.
I have realized something about how Toyota has changed—Toyota, which used to be siloed by 
function, has now become united as one. What is the driving force behind this? I think it is 
our mission.
“Let’s make ever-better cars.”
“Let’s aim to be the best in town, not the best in the world.”
“Let’s achieve sustainable growth.”
“Let’s work for the sake of others.”

 colleagues around the world comes down to the importance of thinking through the  questions, 
“What is our purpose as a company?” and “How can we contribute to the world?”

Our Founding Spirit: For the Sake of Others 
Sakichi Toyoda Sought to Ease His 
Mother’s Burden
Sakichi Toyoda, the founder of the Toyota Group, 
was born the son of a carpenter in the village of 
Yamaguchi, now part of Kosai City, Shizuoka 
Prefecture, in 1867. Full of curiosity, Sakichi is said to 
have spent his early years reading a wide range of 
books, thinking about how he might make a contri-
bution to society. One day, Sakichi was thinking 
about his mother, and how every evening she toiled 
at her loom, weaving fabric late into the night. He 
wondered if there might be a way to make her work 
easier. At the time, weaving was a laborious process, 
requiring the use of both hands and legs to control 
the threads of warp and weft in sequence. At the 
age of 23, Sakichi invented his first loom, the Toyoda 
Wooden Hand Loom, which could be operated with 
only one hand and greatly increased efficiency. He 
patented the loom in May 1891. 
  Seeking to more dramatically increase capacity, 
Sakichi turned his attention to developing 
a  powered loom and invented Japan’s first, the 
Toyoda Power Loom, for which he received 
a  patent in August 1898. 
  Sakichi continued to invent and improve looms 
for more than two decades. This work came to 
head with the Non-Stop Shuttle Change Toyoda 
Automatic Loom, Type G, invented in 1924 in 
collaboration with his son, Kiichiro. 
  At the time, automatic looms had to be con-
stantly watched over by human operators so that 
they could intervene when unpredictable anoma-
lies, such as threads breaking, occurred. The Type 
G automatic loom used a mechanism to detect 
anomalies like running out of or breaks in the 
thread, stopping automatically in response. 
  Furthermore, the Type G automatically changed 
the loom’s shuttle when the thread was close to 
running out. When changing the shuttles holding 
the weft thread, operators previously had to use 
their mouths to suck the end of the thread through 
the eye of the shuttle, inhaling cotton dust, which 
caused problems in the lungs of many workers. 
Sakichi, Kiichiro, and the colleagues invented a way 
to pull the thread through using a simple manual 
action that took advantage of the thread’s tension. 
  The drive to serve others and make their work 
easier—like Sakichi’s desire to ease the burden of his 
mother and employees—was carried on by his son 
Kiichiro and remains a core value of Toyota today. 
  The Type G automatic loom was said to boast 
the best performance of any loom in the world, 
improving productivity more than twentyfold and 
dramatically increasing textile quality. The success 
of the Type G empowered Kiichiro Toyoda to take 
on the challenge of establishing a Japanese 
automotive industry, which many at the time, 
more than 80 years ago, considered beyond the 
capabilities of Japanese industry. This was the 
work to which he would dedicate the rest of his life. 
Making Domestic Cars and Establishing 
a Japanese Auto Industry 
Kiichiro Toyoda, the son of Sakichi, was born in 
1894. After graduating from college in 1921, he went 
to work at Toyoda Boshoku, his father’s company, 
and traveled to Europe and the United States for the 
first time. In the 1920s, the streets of the United 
States were teeming with Ford Model Ts. The 
automotive era was dawning. In Japan, the number 
of imported automobiles was gradually rising, but 
their use was confined to the very wealthy.

 Our Founding Spirit 
 The Toyoda Principles and Toyota Philosophy 
 Toyota Production System (TPS)
  Kiichiro was already determined to produce 
domestic cars and establish a Japanese auto 
industry. In 1926, Kiichiro was named managing 
director of the newly established Toyoda 
Automatic Loom Works, Ltd. and began studying 
automobiles in earnest. The company established 
an automotive department in September 1933 
and in 1934 officially entered the automotive 
business, completing its first engine prototype. 
In 1935, the first Toyoda Model A1 prototype 
passenger car was completed, and the Toyoda 
Model G1 Truck was announced. The very next 
year, in 1936, mass production of Model AA 
passenger cars commenced. Toyota Motor Co., 
Ltd. was established in 1937, with Kiichiro be-
coming its president in 1941. 
Management Crisis, Labor Disputes, and 
Commitment to Providing Employment 
In post-war 1949 Japan, measures to curb 
inflation rapidly stabilized prices, but the resulting 
reduction in the money supply plunged industry 
into serious funding shortages, triggering the 
so-called “Dodge Line Recession.” The prices of 
iron, steel, and other materials rose, but the 
officially fixed price of automobiles stood 
 unchanged, causing the profitability of the 
 automotive industry to decline significantly. 
In December of that year, Toyota Motor Co., 
Ltd. and its labor union signed a memorandum 
aimed at cooperating to overcome the crisis, 
stating that that the Company was at all costs to 
avoid job cuts as a means of overcoming the 
crisis. Kiichiro had faced employment issues at 
Toyoda Automatic Loom Works during the Showa 
Depression in 1930 and was determined to never 
again allow such a situation to arise. His entry into 
the automotive industry had been in part a strate-
gy to diversify and thereby avoid the recurrence of 
employment problems, so he was, of course, 
resolved to avoid job cuts at all costs in the face 
of the 1949 business crisis.
In January 1950, negotiations with the Bank of 
Japan began on the Toyota Motor Co., Ltd. 
reconstruction plan. In April of that year, Toyota 
Motor Sales Co., Ltd. was established to resolve 
the problem of delays in payments for vehicles, 
a major cause of the Company’s financial troubles. 
Far from improving, however, the situation 
 worsened further. As the Company’s business 
results showed no sign of improvement, 
 labor-management negotiations with the Toyota 
Motor Co., Ltd. labor union deteriorated into a 
protracted dispute. During collective bargaining 
that April, the Company made reconstruction 
proposals centered on job cuts that the labor 
union could not accept, and the dispute 
 continued for another month and a half until 
a memorandum was finally signed in June. 
  Accepting responsibility for the labor disputes, 
Kiichiro Toyoda resigned as president of the 
Company in May 1950. In March 1952, he agreed 
to make his much-awaited return to the position, 
but, before he could do so, he passed away at 
the age of 57. Nevertheless, his aspirations were 
kept alive by his colleagues, who persevered with 
purely home-grown technologies as other 
Japanese automakers were forming technology 
alliances with U.S. and European manufacturers. 
These efforts led to the 1955 launch of the 
Toyopet Crown, the first passenger car to be 
developed and built entirely in Japan, a long-held 
dream of Kiichiro Toyoda. 
The Spirit of Sakichi and Kiichiro Toyoda
Born into a poor family, Sakichi Toyoda was 
driven to make others’ work easier, teaching 
himself in order to invent automatic looms and 
going on to build Toyota’s foundations. Not 
content to simply follow the easy path set by his 
father, Kiicihro Toyoda took on the challenge of 
domestic car-making, which many at the time 
said was impossible, navigating tremendous 
social changes as he built the Company and the 
foundations of Japan’s automotive industry. The 
spirit they embodied—of striving to stay ahead of 
the times and endeavoring to be studious and 
creative for the betterment of lives and society—
lives on in Toyota today. It is the core of what 
makes us Toyota.

 Toyota Production System (TPS)
With an eye toward “Producing 
Happiness for All” - Selections 
from the Q&A session of Toyota’s 
1H/2Q financial results briefing
In 1935, five years after the passing of Sakichi Toyoda, the 
Company had grown to more than 10,000 employees as the 
automotive business ramped up. The Toyoda Principles were 
compiled at this time to convey Sakichi’s teachings to all employees 
and provide guidelines for all aspects of their work. 
  The top management of Toyota that took over from Kiichiro, 
Sakichi’s son, further codified the Toyota Philosophy, encompassing 
Toyota’s values, priorities, and strengths. This philosophy provided 
the answer to the fundamental question, “What is Toyota?” as 
a touchstone for the entire Group.
  The automotive industry is experiencing a once-in-a-century transfor-
mation. In the same way that Toyota transitioned from loom maker to 
automaker, we are now reinventing ourselves as a mobility company.
  To guide us as we push forward into the future amid an era of 
uncertainty, we have now created the Toyota Philosophy Cone, 
a graphic representation of the Toyota Philosophy presented in 
a shape that evokes both the spools of thread used in looms and 
the traffic cones used to guide cars.

The Toyoda Principles, or Five 
Main Principles of Toyoda, 
have since been handed 
down to every Toyota Group 
company and serve as 
guidelines for all employees.
Modern Interpretation
•  We unite as one team regardless of rank in order to contribute to our people, society, 
and communities.
•  We develop and learn from outstanding ideas and cutting-edge technologies across the world. 
We enhance our capabilities utilizing our own wisdom and create new value to continue to lead 
the change.
•  We focus on work that is value-adding, with integrity and practicality, by avoiding 
superficial matters. 
•  We build a sense of community and promote the personal growth of our people while valuing 
mutual trust and equal partnership with our stakeholders.
•  We show humility for the support of our business by our valued stakeholders and society while 
also respecting the diversity of the world.
Five Main Principles of Toyoda 
MISSION
Toyota’s mission since its foundation
Producing Happiness for All
Born into a family of poor farmers, Sakichi Toyoda built the bedrock of today’s Toyota by inventing the Toyoda Automatic Loom by 
himself. Abandoning the easy path left by his father, Kiicihro Toyoda took on the challenge of making cars. Many at the time said it 
was impossible.
  Their passion was carried on by those who worked with them, shaping the Toyota we know today. What they truly wanted to make 
was a sense of happiness for any customer who used their products, as well as happiness for every person involved in the work 
related to those products. The core of this aspiration was the idea of producing happiness for all. 
  However, during Toyota’s long history, there was a brief time when we turned our focus to numbers and gave less thought to people. 
Primarily due to our rapid expansion in the late 20th century, we faced many problems, including quality concerns and trade friction.
  Let us not forget that there are some things that machines cannot create. Only humans can invest the time and energy to bring life 
to such things. We strive to stay ahead of the times, endeavoring to be studious and creative for the betterment of lives and society. 
Using our technology, we work toward a future of convenience and happiness available to all. This is our mission, producing 
 happiness for all, and the core of what makes us Toyota

VISION
The future vision that Toyota aspires to 
Creating Mobility for All
Toyota strives to raise the quality and availability of mobility, so that individuals, 
businesses, municipalities, and communities can do more, while achieving a 
sustainable relationship with our planet. This is our new destination.
  Motorization has enabled freedom of movement and has brought people and 
society closer. As a result, more people than ever can now experience mobility, 
including the “fun to drive” experience.
  And yet, challenges related to mobility persist. There are still many potential 
opportunities to overcome inconveniences and break through the impossible 
with new possibilities. 
  “To move” can refer to physical motion, but also to the experience of being 
emotionally moved. It is our role to move people and bring mobility to life—to 
move hearts, minds, and bodies. To move society.
VALUE
Value that Toyota can promise to stakeholders
Toyota Way 
As we work to realize mobility for all, the road will be rough at times. 
In addition to our commitment to monozukuri (manufacturing), we 
must foster imagination regarding the possibilities of people and 
society. These tangible and intangible aspects together power 
Toyota: imagination fuels monozukuri, and monozukuri sparks new 
imagination. In advancing this cycle, it is essential to center the 
perspectives of our many stakeholders, imagining their points of view.
  We work with our stakeholders and partners, each elevating the 
other, uniting the strengths of all three to create new and unique 
value. This is the new Toyota Way.

 The Toyoda Principles and Toyota Philosophy 
 Toyota Production System (TPS)
Toyota Production System (TPS)
Participant A
I think they are “Just-in-Time” and “automation with 
a human touch,” or “Jidoka.”
Toyoda 
That’s it! That’s what I wanted to hear! (everyone laughs)
That’s why I volunteered to be the lecturer today to 
help kick off the TPS training program. Hopefully, 
I can help narrow the gap between my understanding 
of Jidoka and Just-in-Time and yours.
  First of all, let’s talk about Jidoka. It’ll be easier to 
explain the concept by first looking at the automatic 
loom invented by Sakichi Toyoda. Thinking about his 
mother, and how she toiled to weave fabrics every 
evening and late into the night, the young Sakichi 
wondered if there might be a way to ease her burden. 
When Sakichi developed his first automated loom, both 
hands were used to control the threads of warp and weft. 
His invention allowed his mother to operate a loom using 
only one hand. It also helped improve quality, increasing 
overall efficiency and dramatically improving productivity.
Often at Toyota, TPS is considered the process of 
making things efficient, and people talk about it as if 
changing work processes is TPS’s purpose. But, 
I think the purpose should always be to make 
someone’s work easier.
  2.  Improving Productivity was not the 
Main Purpose
The Type G automatic loom is the machine that helped 
drive a redesign of Toyota’s business. Automatic looms 
back then were always monitored by one operator, 
based on a mindset of “one person, one machine.” 
Each person was the “guard” of their machine.
This was because operators were unable to 
predict abnormalities.
With this automatic loom, Toyota was able to secure the 
capital required to shift its business model from an 
automatic loom manufacturer to a car manufacturer. This 
was because a world-leading automatic loom company 
in the United Kingdom asked Toyota to sell its automatic 
loom technology.
The most common abnormalities that occurred when 
weaving fabric with automatic looms were when 
thread ran out or broke. The Type G was able to 
detect such abnormalities at a time when there were 
no sensors. 
  When the thread ran out, it automatically changed 
to another wooden shuttle with a new thread. 
  The shuttle needs to have the thread end out on 
the surface. Before this machine was invented, 
workers had to suck it out themselves. The problem 
was that there was a lot of cotton dust in the air in 
textile factories, which could damage workers’ lungs 
when they inhaled deeply. Sakichi invented a new 
feature that automatically brought out the thread end. 
This invention was the result of Sakichi simply 
exploring a desire to do something for his team 
members on the manufacturing front lines who were 
suffering damage in their lungs.
  Thus, Sakichi determined what the abnormalities 
were and then came up with system to prevent or 
stop them. As a result, productivity improved—not 
the other way around. He did not do all this just to 
improve productivity.
  3.  How President Toyoda Sees Jidoka 
(Automation with a Human Touch)
In my view, Jidoka is about being centered on 
people. It’s about putting yourself in the shoes of 
someone working there. You can’t just issue orders 
to improve efficiency or reduce resources from the 
safety of your position far from the front lines. 
Toyota also has this idea about adjusting the work 
per person to match the full output of one unit of 
manpower (pursuing ichi-nin-ku in Japanese).
This concept of ichi-nin-ku means the amount of work 
that one worker can or should accomplish in a day. 
We all only have 24 hours in a day. This applies equally 
to everyone. And employees spend a lot of that time 
devoted to work for a company. Knowing this, 
supervisors must make the work being done by team 
members as meaningful as possible. That is what 
Toyota’s manufacturing front lines have been pursuing.
The focus is creating more free time for workers by 
eliminating waste in work processes to reduce overtime. 
Pursuing ichi-nin-ku means valuing each person’s time. 
  4.  How President Toyoda Sees 
Just-in-Time
A phrase that is commonly associated with the concept 
of Just-in-Time is “provide what is needed, when 
needed, in the amount needed.” The key to understand-
ing Just-in-Time is the idea of “lead time,” the amount of 
In May 2020, at Toyota’s financial results briefing, 
President Akio Toyoda reflected on the efforts the 
Company had made over the previous few years, saying:
“Over the past few years, we came to feverishly engage 
in both a fight to bring back what makes us Toyota 
and the complete redesign of Toyota for the future.”
Revisiting messages President Toyoda gave starting from 
a few years ago, two of the things he repeatedly has said 
that makes us Toyota are the Toyota Production System, 
or TPS, and cost reduction.
  Last year, at Toyota Motor Corporation in Japan, 
a new training program was started to nurture a select 
group of “TPS leaders” from various divisions across the 
Company. To emphasize the importance of the program 
and to share his own thoughts about TPS, President 
Toyoda joined the kick-off session.
  1.  Sakichi Toyoda Sought to Ease His 
Mother’s Burdens
This training program was created for Toyota’s manage-
ment leaders who don’t work at manufacturing front 
lines to gain a deeper understanding of TPS in order to 
help the Company accelerate its efforts to bring back the 
essence of what makes it Toyota as it looks to completely 
redesign Toyota for the future.
Toyoda 
I was a little concerned to hear today’s participants’ 
statement of determination to “change Toyota any 
way possible by utilizing what’s learned and obtained 
through this program.” 
  There are two key concepts deeply rooted in 
Toyota since its foundation, or even before then. 
Does anyone know what they are?
7
What is the Toyota Production System?
Akio Toyoda’s View
time required for products or services to be delivered 
after they are ordered.
Toyoda 
What comes to mind when you think about 
Just-in-Time?
  Taking a “what is needed when needed” approach, 
to respond quickly to customer needs, there would 
need to be a lot of inventory, right? One finished 
vehicle consists of about 30,000 parts. So, it would 
follow that for a production line to flexibly produce 
orders quickly, a tremendous amount of inventory 
would need to on hand, right?
Participant B
But if we know and can meet what customers want...
Toyoda 
Who do you mean by “customers”?
Participant B
Each downstream process... or our final end users.
Toyoda 
But we sell around 10 million new vehicles annually, 
and that means we have the same number of 
customers. How can we understand what is needed 
by each specific customer? We can’t, so instead, we 
have to have a lean operation in place to detect 
abnormalities right away and halt the pipeline so that 
we can make improvements quickly. And that’s why 
we need Just-in-Time.
In this way, I think the key concept that makes 
Just-in-Time easier to understand is “lead time.”
At Toyota, a common term for the next process in 
a workflow, whether it be in manufacturing or in an office, 
is “downstream process.” Those in the downstream are 
considered a “customer.” President Toyoda was trying to 
convince the participants to think of “Just-in-Time” in the 
context of the bigger picture, to consider not only the 
immediate downstream, but how things relate to the 
company as a whole to deliver Toyota’s vehicles to the 
end customers “just-in-time.”
  5.  Achieving the Lead Time of  
a Sushi Restaurant?
Take, for example, sushi. When you go to an authen-
tic sushi restaurant, are the finished orders just 
waiting in front of the chef? I don’t think so. Each 
piece is made to order. You can’t prepare every 
specification in advance for 10 million customers.
It’s important to understand what we can’t do. The 
key, then, is trying to shorten lead time.

Recently, President Akio Toyoda has often 
been adding “from a starting point in

 “ever-better car making.” He spoke about

engineers to prepare, I safely finished the

races. For each race, they continued to 
improve the car, making it stronger and faster. 
themselves. I think that they came to under-
stand Kiichiro’s words not just intellectually, 
but in a deeper, visceral way. 
In 1952, shortly 
before his death, 
the founder  
Kiichiro Toyoda 
wrote the following.
I think that these words provide the core 
principle of “ever-better car making from 
a starting point in motorsports.” There were 
two cars that led me to this core principle.
The other car is the GR Yaris.
We made this car for a specific purpose: to 
win the World Rally Championship.
Until now, Toyota has made its race cars by 
modifying its mass-production cars. That was 
the limit of what we could do. The GR Yaris is 
our attempt to flip this approach by designing 
a race car from the ground up. From the 
initial stages of development, we reached out 
to professional drivers to have them drive the 
car. When problems came to light during their 
drives, they were fixed, and then we had 
them drive the car again. Development 
progressed nimbly, and the car evolved into 
one that is fun to drive. As Morizo (my driver 
name), I partnered with this car on the 
Gamagori dirt course for training to hone my 
driving skills. 
Come to think of it, it has been 14 years 
since Hiromu Naruse and I drove used 
Altezzas in the 24 Hours of Nürburgring 
endurance race. Racing on the streets 
toughens people up and makes cars stron-
ger. I want to enable Toyota to make cars 
that way again. That may be what I have 
been working toward all along.
In 2009, when I became president, I implored 
our employees to make ever-better cars. 
Since then, I often get asked what kind of 
cars are ever-better cars.
I have a certain idea of what makes a better 
car. It’s not necessarily the same as someone 
else’s idea of a better car. What makes a 
better car depends on the driver. It is for this 
reason that cars can only be made in the 
streets and not at a desk.
However, back in 2009, not many people 
understood what I meant by this. It’s not 
enough to simply tell someone that the

“The Japanese automobile production industry 
must master the art of manufacturing passenger 
vehicles. In order to test the durability and perfor-
mance of their cars, companies ought to participate 
in auto races, demonstrate the full performance of 
their vehicles, and compete for superiority. This will 
both lead to progress in their vehicles and spark 
the enthusiasm of automobile fans. Such races 
must not be regarded as a simple matter of curiosity, 
for they are indispensable to the development of 
Japan’s automobile manufacturing industry.”

Interest rates remained at historical lows. Growth in many markets 
was anemic. Policy gridlock and political risk drove uncertainty. 
And the assets of many pension funds — and the nest eggs of 
many individuals — continued to fall short of the increasing 
financial demands created by people living longer. The result is a 
growing retirement gap in many societies.

•   We earned a record $2.4 billion on an adjusted basis, or $13.68 
per share, up 15% from 2011, and generated a 3% increase 
in revenues to $9.3 billion, with a 5% increase in adjusted 
operating earnings. 
•   Our scale and financial flexibility enabled us to produce a 
40.4% adjusted operating margin, delivering on our 40% target 
and improving our margin by 70 basis points from the prior year. 
•   Our significant operating cash flow, of approximately $3 billion 
as adjusted, allowed us to continue extending our product

selective tactical acquisitions to help drive future growth.

We also maintained our commitment to sound capital 
management by returning cash to shareholders through cash 
dividends and share repurchases. Our dividend of $6.00 per 
share in 2012 increased by 9% over 2011 and represented a 
43% dividend payout ratio. In January 2013, we announced an 
additional 12% increase in our annual dividend to $6.72 per share. 
In addition, during 2012, we repurchased nearly 9.1 million shares, 
resulting in an overall payout ratio of 104%. This included support 
of a successful secondary offering of more than 26 million shares, 
representing Barclays Bank PLC’s overall investment in the firm, 
and involved our repurchase of $1.0 billion in shares.
In total, including the repurchase of 13.6 million shares from Bank 
of America in June 2011, BlackRock has reduced its share count 
by approximately 11% since March 2011, helping to drive our 
15% growth in earnings per share in 2012. Equally important, our 
shareholder base has been transformed in just over two years, 
as our public ownership has increased from roughly 20% to 80%, 
with a market capitalization of over $43 billion at the end of  
March 2013.
trends shaPing the new world of investing  
— and Blackrock
Market direction and investor behavior were further impacted by 
several megatrends that are reshaping the landscape for investors 
across the globe.
The first of these megatrends is the aging of populations around 
the world. Not only are the numbers of people retiring every year 
growing as the boomer generation “comes of age,” individuals

continued to affect the investment environment.
Macroeconomic and political risk persisted across the globe 
and roiled financial markets — including the fiscal challenges 
facing Europe and the United States, slower growth and political 
succession in China and turmoil in the Middle East. While US 
equity markets delivered strong returns, the picture in other 
markets was mixed. Memories of the 2008 financial crisis weighed 
on attitudes to risk. These barriers to confidence led businesses, 
institutions and individual investors to keep billions of dollars on 
the sidelines.
Investors also felt little relief from global regulatory uncertainty. 
The wave of post-crisis regulation in areas including proprietary 
trading, derivatives and the taxation of financial transactions is 
starting to have a cumulative effect that is reducing liquidity and 
increasing costs for investors to a degree that may indeed slow 
economic recovery. BlackRock has continued to make sure the 
voice of the investor is heard as policy makers consider reforms 
related to US money markets and financial benchmarks, and 
pursue complex initiatives in Europe that may significantly alter 
how markets operate.

preparation. Both corporate and public pension plans, as well as 
far too many individuals, face significant shortfalls in meeting 
future needs for retirement income. This funding crisis is also 
being compounded by the shift from employer-funded defined 
benefit (DB) plans to defined contribution (DC) plans that 
transfer the risk to individuals. In this era of historically low bond 
yields, this shift will leave many people woefully unprepared 
for retirement since individuals have made significantly higher 
allocations to bonds than institutional investors.

platform positions us well to help clients rethink and diversify 
their portfolios.
meeting clients’ goals in an  
outcome-oriented world
In this dynamic environment, investors are seeking new 
approaches to investing as their goals and interests change. 
BlackRock continues to evolve to meet these new demands and 
build value for the long term.
Indeed, against this backdrop, investors are redefining the very 
notion of performance: from tracking benchmarks to achieving 
desired outcomes — whether a target income level or lifecycle 
asset allocation. Valuing consistency of returns over absolute 
returns, investors now also increasingly seek higher-yielding 
opportunities and greater diversification, through strategies 
such as barbelling to maximize returns with an appropriate risk/
reward balance. We believe that BlackRock is unique among asset 
managers in our ability to meet this need with our full breadth of 
tools and risk management services.
We’ve also seen more and more clients — from the largest 
institutions to individual investors — look to combine superior 
investment products with the broader risk management, asset 
allocation and asset/liability solutions that we offer through our 
BlackRock Solutions® advisory services and the analytical power 
of our Aladdin technology platform.
In anticipation of changing investor objectives, we invested last 
year in five strategic areas. These areas represented 75% of our 
net new flows for 2012 and — with the addition of Emerging 
Markets — remain priorities in 2013:
•	 iShares ETFs — Demand for efficient and targeted market 
exposures — along with the October 2012 launch of the iShares 
Core Series of 10 US ETFs designed for buy-and-hold retail 
investors — drove 14% organic AUM growth in iShares last year. 
Our diverse platform positions us  
well to help clients rethink and diversify 
their portfolios
The second megatrend is the secular shift to passive investing in 
ETFs and indexing. ETF inflows hit new record highs industry-wide 
in 2012, both in North America and globally. In our view, this shift is 
more than just a short-term market phenomenon; it is a systemic 
behavioral change. This has significant implications for the asset 
management industry, and BlackRock stands to benefit from this 
trend given our iShares ETF platform.

solutions and to capitalize on growth potential in Retail, which 
represents 12% of our long-term assets but contributes more 
than 30% of our long-term base fees, we aligned Retail with 
iShares last year. We also integrated our US BlackRock and 
iShares retail sales teams to better deliver the breadth of our 
capabilities to our distribution partners, who look more and 
more to BlackRock to help them address their business model 
challenges in the face of regulatory complexities. As financial 
advisers increasingly serve as portfolio managers and asset 
allocators for their clients, BlackRock is actively working to 
support their success with outcome-oriented model portfolios 
and retail-focused multi-asset solutions. 
Finally, the BlackRock Investment Institute again harnessed 
insights to promote dialogue among investors across the firm and 
to create high-value research for our clients on topics including 
the US housing market, China’s evolving economic role and the 
impact of the sovereign debt crisis in Europe, among others. 
investing in future growth
Over the past year, we made tactical acquisitions to grow 
individual businesses and our geographic footprint. Our 
acquisition of Claymore Investments in March expanded our  
offering of ETFs in the Canadian market. In September, we  
purchased Swiss Re Ltd.’s European private equity and 
infrastructure fund of funds unit, bolstering our strong 
alternatives business. We will continue to look for opportunities to 
enhance inorganic growth where it makes sense to do so. 
We continued to invest in talent, both by developing and elevating 
internal leaders and attracting new leaders from outside the firm. 
Philipp Hildebrand, former Chairman of the Swiss National Bank, 
joined BlackRock as Vice Chairman and oversees our largest 
institutional client relationships in EMEA and Asia Pacific. More 
recently, Gary Shedlin, a long-time strategic and financial advisor 
to BlackRock, joined the firm from Morgan Stanley to become 
our new Chief Financial Officer. We also enhanced our presence 
in Asia, where Hsueh-ming Wang joined the firm as Chairman of 
BlackRock China.
BlackRock’s first global brand initiative — our “Investing for a 
New World” campaign — drove awareness of our capabilities 
and expertise among existing and potential clients. The growing 
strength of our brand was reflected this spring when Fortune 
magazine named BlackRock the “World’s Most Admired Company” 
in our industry.

Message from  
the Chairman
Peter Coates
Dear Shareholder,
The sustained low oil price environment continues to impact oil 
and gas companies around the globe. Sharp cuts have been made 
to exploration and production programs, supply continues to 
outpace demand and the outlook for stronger global economic 
growth remains at risk. 
Despite the challenging backdrop, our confidence in the long-term 
demand for energy remains strong. Natural gas, in particular, is  
well positioned to benefit from not only a rapidly growing and 
increasingly urbanised global population but also the move toward 
cleaner burning fuels.
Whilst we are confident in the long term demand for energy, the 
volatility exhibited by external markets is beyond our control. Our 
commitment, therefore, is to ensure the company is self-sustaining 
in a low oil price environment, now and into the future. We have 
already implemented significant initiatives to drive costs out, 
improve productivity and ultimately, produce more for less, but 
there is still much to be done. The Board, senior management and 
all employees are committed and engaged to improve efficiencies 
and restore shareholder value. 
Despite the successful delivery of first LNG in September 2015  
from our GLNG project, I accept, that when key LNG investment 
decisions were made, like most in the sector, we did not fully 
anticipate the timing, speed and depth of the down cycle for oil 
prices. Santos, however, is running a long-term business. Over the 
past five years, our multi-billion dollar investments in PNG LNG 
and GLNG were made with this in mind. While they have required 
us to increase our debt level in the short-term, they are by  
no means short-term projects. Any final judgement on the  
success of our LNG strategy should be measured through the  
oil price cycle and not based on the spot price today. 
Looking to the future, one of our key advantages is that our LNG 
assets have low operating costs. They can operate effectively in a 
low oil price environment and will materially benefit shareholders  
as and when market conditions improve. These strategic assets 
are underpinned by world class resources, high quality partners 
and binding long-term offtake agreements that will generate cash 
for decades to come.
The growing demand for energy coupled with the significant cuts 
to investment by oil and gas companies globally is expected to lead 
to a recalibration of oil prices to higher levels. Santos, with its key 
infrastructure position, abundant resources and LNG exposure, is 
well-placed to benefit.
STRENGTHENING THE BALANCE SHEET
In November 2014, the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting 
Countries (OPEC) announced its intention to maintain high levels 
of oil output to protect their market-share against the rise of 
non-OPEC production, particularly shale oil out of the USA. 
Following this announcement, Santos reacted quickly and sought 
to reposition the company for a lower oil price environment.
In December 2014, we announced a 25% reduction to the 2015 
capital expenditure budget and negotiated a $1 billion bilateral bank 
facility to further strengthen our balance sheet. In February 2015  
a recruitment freeze was announced, approximately 500 positions 
were removed from the company, and a 10% reduction in unit 
production costs was targeted over the remainder of the year.
Despite these early initiatives, as the year progressed, it became 
increasingly evident that oil prices were to remain under significant 
pressure for longer than we, and the market, had anticipated. 
OPEC reaffirmed their commitment to maintain high crude output, 
US shale production proved to be unexpectedly resilient, and 
market sentiment continued to be negatively impacted by the 
expectation of higher oil exports from Iran and the risk of lower 
economic growth out of China. 
Santos Annual Report 2015 / 1

--- Page 4 ---
With our major LNG investment 
program behind us, we are now 
firmly focused on becoming a low 
cost producer.
Against this deteriorating external backdrop, on 9 November  
2015, the company announced $3.5 billion of capital initiatives  
to strengthen the balance sheet and reduce net debt.
The first initiative was the sale of Santos’ 35% interest in the 
Kipper gas field, offshore Victoria, for $520 million. Further asset 
sales were considered at this time but the Board determined that 
it was not in the best interests of shareholders to sell tier one 
assets at prices that did not adequately reflect their long-term 
value. 
The second initiative was the $500 million private placement to 
Hony Capital. This was done at a substantial premium to the then 
share price. This share placement to Hony at $6.80 per share 
reflected a clear vote of confidence in Santos’ long-term value 
proposition.
Finally, the decision to raise equity was not taken lightly but 
ultimately, given an external environment characterised by  
extreme uncertainty, it was determined that it was in the best 
interest of shareholders. With strong shareholder support, we 
raised $2.5 billion via a 1 for 1.7 accelerated pro-rata renounceable 
entitlement offer.
As a result of these initiatives, our balance sheet today is much 
stronger. We have retained our investment grade credit rating and 
have a very strong liquidity position with $4.8 billion in cash and 
undrawn debt facilities as at 31 December 2015. The initiatives 
undertaken in 2015 were firmly focused on strengthening the 
company’s balance sheet and we now have a capital buffer to 
reinforce the company through a lower oil price environment.
NEW DIVIDEND POLICY
A revised dividend framework was also announced at this time  
to better reflect the company’s exposure to oil-linked LNG pricing 
and the cyclical characteristics of global oil markets. 
Dividends will now be set as a payout ratio of earnings. Subject to 
business conditions, this is expected to be a minimum of 40% of 
underlying net profit after tax. For the 2015 final dividend, a fully 
franked 5 cents per share dividend was declared.
MANAGEMENT RENEWAL
As a business, we have also started to change the way we  
do things. With our major LNG investment program behind us,  
we are now firmly focused on becoming a low cost producer.  
With this in mind, the Board was pleased to appoint Mr Kevin 
Gallagher as the new Managing Director and CEO. 
Mr Gallagher was previously Chief Executive Officer of the 
engineering services group, Clough Limited and has 25 years’ 
experience managing oil and gas operations in Australia, the  
USA and North and West Africa. He is widely recognised for  
his achievements in driving strong financial performance and  
is ideally suited to lead the company as the focus moves from 
major strategic developments to delivering strong operational 
results in a low oil price environment. Indeed, he has a clear 
mandate from the Board to continue to lower the cost base  
of the company’s operations and ensure Santos is sustainable  
and self-funding at low oil prices.
Mr Gallagher started at Santos on 1 February 2016.

CONFIDENCE FOR THE FUTURE
Finally, in what has been an extremely challenging year, I would  
like to thank you, our shareholders, for your continued support.  
The company has gone through a significant investment phase and 
the focus now is to consolidate the business and drive efficiencies 
to ensure Santos is self-sustaining in a lower oil price environment.  
We have made material and sustainable cost reductions but there  
is a lot more to be done.
In 2016, we are scaling back our short-term investment plans  
on a number of projects as we work through funding priorities  
in response to the lower oil price. Our growth options are 
incremental, low risk and will be prioritised to ensure the best 
return for shareholders. We will continue to refine our strategy  
and update the market in due course.
We can be confident in the strong and growing demand for energy 
and our portfolio of high-quality assets is well placed to benefit. 
We are determined to restore and maximise shareholder value.

Introducing
Kevin Gallagher,  
Managing Director  
and Chief Executive Officer
Kevin joined Santos as Managing Director and Chief 
Executive Officer on 1 February 2016. 
Kevin is a senior executive with more than 25 years’ 
experience in managing oil and gas operations in Australia, 
the USA and North and West Africa.
A qualified mechanical engineer, Kevin commenced his 
career as a drilling engineer with Mobil North Sea Ltd, 
before joining Woodside Petroleum Ltd in 1998. During a  
13 year tenure with Woodside, he led the drilling organisation 
through rapid growth, delivering several Australian and 
international development projects and exploration 
campaigns. In his last role he was accountable for profit 
and loss on Australia’s largest resource project, the North 
West Shelf, where he held the positions of Executive Vice 
President, North West Shelf Business Unit and CEO of  
the North West Shelf Venture.
Appointed Managing Director and CEO of Clough Ltd in 
2011, Kevin implemented strategies that transformed the 
business. He established a strong leadership team, improved 
cost and operational performance and delivered record 
financial results. He oversaw the development of innovative 
programs to improve safety and drive productivity and 
executed an M&A and international expansion strategy 
which saw Clough enter five new regions including the  
US, UK, Canada, Africa and Asia.
In 2013 Kevin was recognised by Australia’s CEO Magazine 
as the CEO of the Year, and the Energy and Resources 
Executive of the Year.
4 / Santos Annual Report 2015
Dear Shareholder,
Since joining Santos two months ago I have focused my efforts on 
getting up to speed to understand the issues and the opportunities 
across our portfolio of assets. I am working hard to develop a clear 
strategy for the future and am determined to build an organisation 
with a reputation for delivering what we promise.
There is no question that lower oil prices present significant 
challenges to the oil and gas industry, to Santos and to you, our 
shareholders. The dynamics of supply and demand have brought 
into stark reality the need to ensure that our assets are operated  
in a disciplined and efficient manner.
If we look at the 2015 production and safety results, operationally 
we have a lot to work with. What cannot be ignored, however, is 
the steep decline in the oil price and the impact this is having on 
our business. It is clear that we must do better. 
Production of 57.7 million barrels of oil equivalent in 2015 was the 
company’s highest in seven years, underpinned by a full-year of 
production from PNG LNG, the start-up of GLNG in the third 
quarter and record annual production from Darwin LNG. 
The first cargo departed GLNG in October and marked a significant 
milestone in a project that is set to run for decades to come. Train 1 
production has regularly exceeded 10% above nameplate capacity 
and as at the end of February 2016 the project had produced 
approximately 1.2 million tonnes of LNG and shipped 18 cargoes.
The PNG LNG project shipped 101 cargoes in 2015 as strong 
upstream deliverability and reliable plant performance resulted  
in the plant operating 7% above its nameplate capacity at an 
annualised rate of 7.4 million tonnes per annum.
We recorded some exploration success in 2015, announcing  
a significant oil discovery in March 2015 from the Bestari-1 
exploration well located offshore Malaysia. Further, in the Cooper 
Basin, the first stand-alone Permian Source Rock play producer, 
the Tirrawarra South-1 well, was successfully brought online in  
May and is flowing liquids-rich gas in line with forecasts.

--- Page 7 ---
I am working hard to develop 
a clear strategy for the future 
and am determined to build an 
organisation with a reputation  
for delivering what we promise.
Despite this operational performance, a net loss of $2.7 billion  
was reported, reflecting after tax impairments of $2.8 billion.  
The impairment charges are primarily a result of the current  
lower oil price environment. The impairment charge is an 
accounting adjustment that relates to the historical book  
value of the company’s assets.
The impairment charge was attributed predominantly to the 
company’s Cooper Basin, GLNG and Gunnedah Basin assets. 
Although the lower oil price has resulted in a reduction of  
capital expenditure and the deferral of field development plans,  
we remain committed to meeting our contractual obligations  
from the Cooper Basin and the GLNG project, and will continue  
to progress the evaluation and approvals processes for the 
Narrabri Gas opportunity.
EBITDAX1 of $1.9 billion was down 17% on the previous year 
despite the oil price declining by almost 50%. Underlying net  
profit after tax was $50 million, 91% lower than the prior year,  
a result again impacted by the weak oil price. Operating cash  
flow was strong at $1.1 billion, due in part to the defensive  
nature of our domestic gas assets.
Over the course of 2015 we reduced capex by 54%, cut 825 
employee positions across the company and secured $230 million  
in savings across the supply chain. Unit production costs were down 
10% to $14.40 per barrel of oil equivalent. We remain committed  
to further driving costs out of the business and working closely 
with our joint venture partners to improve efficiencies. 
These savings can only be achieved through the hard work  
of all of our teams, and are reflective of a new mind-set where 
producing more for less is expected. We have made a significant 
start, but we are certainly not done and we must continue to 
improve our performance.
It is vital that we continue to take costs out of our business.  
My first priority and absolute focus is to look closely at our 
operations. I am scrutinising our portfolio of assets and the 
structure and processes that we have in place to manage them.  
I am working hard to develop the right management team, the 
right strategy and the right culture to make Santos self-sustaining 
in a low oil price environment and well positioned to take full 
advantage of rising commodity prices in the future.
We must continue to adapt to changing market conditions. 
Change is required if we are to stay competitive and I will be 
working quickly to identify further actions that are essential  
to effectively manage the business.
In a period of significant operational and cultural change, it  
was pleasing to see in 2015 the company record its best safety 
performance on record with a Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate 
(LTIFR) of 0.1 per million hours worked. We must, however, remain 
vigilant across all of our operations to ensure everyone goes home 
without injury. In addition, we were recognised for our sustainable 
operations and placed in the top 10% of the leading 2,500 
companies globally by the Dow Jones Sustainability Index. 
Companies are selected for inclusion in the index based on a 
comprehensive assessment of long-term economic, environmental 
and social criteria. For further information I would encourage you 
to read our 2015 Sustainability Report, available on our website at 
www.santos.com/sustainability
I look forward to the challenges ahead and will update you on the 
progress we make in due course. 
This is a great company with a great history. It’s an incredible 
honour for me to lead and serve this company and I have high 
expectations that Santos will emerge from this period a stronger 
and more sustainable business.

A.G. Lafley
Chairman of the Board,  
President and  
Chief Executive Officer
Dear Shareholders,
P&G is focused on winning with those who matter most: consumers, 
customers and shareholders. P&G’s performance in fiscal 2013 was a step in this 
direction. Our results were in line with objectives the Company set at the beginning  
of the fiscal year:
• Organic sales growth was 3%. 
• Core earnings per share increased 5%, despite the 
operating impact of the Venezuelan currency devaluation 
and significant strengthening of the dollar. 
• Our progress on working capital and capital spending 
productivity enabled us to deliver 98% adjusted free cash 
flow productivity. 
• We returned $12.5 billion in cash to shareholders —  
110% of net earnings — through a combination of 
$6.5 billion in dividends and $6 billion in share 
repurchase. In April, we raised the dividend by 7%. 
We’re beginning to restore growth in the core U.S. market that represents over a third

--- Page 4 ---
2  The Procter & Gamble Company
We are moving in the right direction. Company performance  
is improving in several key measures. We are building on  
this momentum. Business plans are more focused. The core 
strengths and assets of our Company remain important sources 
of competitive advantage and are the primary source of my 
confidence in P&G’s future. 
We are focusing on core businesses, which include the leading, 
most profitable categories and countries. Delivering strong results 
in our core businesses is the largest contributor to shareholder 
value creation. Core businesses are an important contributor to 
growth, and an enabler of investments in developing markets 
and innovation.
But there is more work to do. More business units have to 
perform better more consistently. We are making the changes 
necessary to improve performance significantly.
We’ve established value creation for consumers  
and shareholders as our clear priority.
P&G’s Priority Is Value Creation
First, we’ve established value creation — for consumers and 
shareholders — as our clear priority. This starts with winning the 
value equation with the consumer, who is always the boss.  
We have to win at the first moment of truth, when the consumer 
chooses our product at the store shelf, and the second moment 
of truth, when the consumer uses the product at home and 
decides whether to buy it again. We also have to win at the 
“zero moment of truth,” when the consumer discovers information 
about our brands and products before they shop. When P&G 
products win the consumer value equation versus competitors, 
consumers reward us — and our shareholders — with their hard-
earned money.
We’ll measure our business performance through operating  
total shareholder return. This goal is important because it’s an 
integrated measure of value creation at the business unit level. 
Strong operating TSR requires sales growth, progress on  
gross and operating margins, and strong cash flow productivity. 
Business units will be guided by disciplined strategies and 
operating plans that focus on the most important choices for 
creating value.

P&G Is Driving Value Creation through 
Productivity and Innovation
Second, we are significantly strengthening productivity and cost 
savings efforts. Innovation and productivity are the two biggest 
drivers of value creation. Innovation remains our primary driver 
of growth, and we have a strong innovation pipeline, but we 
need to increase our focus on productivity. Productivity provides 
financial resources to invest in growth, and productivity frees 
P&G people to fully utilize their capabilities and make bigger 
contributions to the business. 
With nearly $500 million in sales in 
North America this fiscal year, Tide PODS  
is now expanding globally — starting  
with Latin America, Western  
and Central Europe, and Africa.
Crest and Oral-B 3D White toothpaste 
have grown value share in the U.S. for  
13 consecutive quarters — every quarter since 
3D White first launched — and are now sold 
in more than 40 markets globally.
Fusion ProGlide launched in the U.S.  
three years ago. It is now in more than 
45 markets, most recently expanding  
to Brazil, Mexico and China. Fusion  
has grown global value share for 
30 straight quarters — ever since the 
first Fusion product launched.

--- Page 5 ---
We’re making significant progress. By the end of fiscal 2013,  
we reduced non-manufacturing enrollment by 7,000 roles,  
which is 1,300 role reductions ahead of our initial target.  
We delivered over $1.2 billion in cost-of-goods-sold savings  
and we improved manufacturing productivity by 7%, both  
ahead of target. Still, we have significant opportunities to 
continue improving productivity in all facets of the business.
We will deliver the productivity improvements we promised  
on or ahead of schedule — but that is not an endpoint for 
productivity improvement at P&G. It’s a milestone. We know  
we can do more. We are making productivity systemic, 
not episodic.
We are significantly 
strengthening  
productivity and  
cost savings efforts. 
We’re already mobilized to address the next round of 
productivity initiatives, which we are working in parallel, not 
sequentially. They cover a full range of cost and cash 
opportunities. The projects are being led by business unit  
and function leaders. Some are yielding savings already and 
others will take a few years to fully implement.
The Procter & Gamble Company  3
We’re making  
strategic investments  
in innovation  
and go-to-market  
capabilities. 
In developing markets, we have opportunities to locate supply 
chains closer to the customers and consumers we serve.  
This will enable us to reduce costs and serve customers faster.  
In developed markets, we are studying options that would 
reduce the number of facilities, build scale across categories,  
and reduce costs and inventory — all while improving customer 
service. This will require investment, but should generate very 
attractive returns.
We’ll improve marketing return on investment, driven by a better 
mix of media, greater message clarity, and greater efficiency in 
non-advertising marketing spending. 
Productivity will become one of P&G’s core strengths — like brand 
building and innovation, for example — to deliver value creation 
and growth.
P&G Is Improving Execution
Our third focus area is to step-change operating discipline.  
We simply have to execute better, more consistently and more 
reliably than our competitors. We know this is necessary to  
win with consumers and customers day in and day out —  
which is a requirement for delivering leadership returns in our 
Pantene Expert Collection Age Defy

industry. Quality execution has long been a hallmark of  
P&G’s success. We are committed to return to the standards  
of excellence necessary to win.
We’re committed  
to do what it takes to  
get P&G back to  
balanced, consistent,  
reliable, and sustainable  
value creation. 
P&G Is Investing in Capabilities 
for Growth
Our final focus area is to make strategic, focused investments in 
innovation and go-to-market capabilities. These are two of our 
core strengths as a Company and two important sources of 
competitive advantage and growth. They are critical to winning 
the first and second moments of truth.
P&G Is Committed to Winning
We will build on the past year, but we’ll be more focused. We’ll 
commercialize brand and product innovations with excellence. 
We’ll implement productivity initiatives to significantly simplify how 
we work and realize savings. We’ll focus on best-in-class execution, 
and we’ll continue to invest selectively where needed to win.
I’m as confident as ever that P&G has what’s needed to win —  
with consumers, customers and shareholders. We have a strong 
brand portfolio: 25 billion-dollar brands and roughly 15 more 
between half-a-billion and a billion dollars in annual sales. 
We have a well-balanced geographic portfolio. We are the 
leading non-food consumer products business in the U.S. — the 
largest and fastest-growing developed market — and the leading 
household and personal care business in developing markets. 
Both present significant value creation opportunities. We have 
an innovation portfolio and pipeline that will only get stronger. 
We have a broad portfolio of productivity initiatives.
Most fundamentally, we have an exceptional organization.  
P&G people are passionate about consumers and P&G’s 
businesses. They bring tremendous experience and expertise  
to every part of our business. They are committed to win.  
They are our most important asset, the critical source of  
strength and competitive advantage for P&G.
We’ve taken a hard look at what we need to do and how we 
need to change to perform better. We’re committed to do  
what it takes to get P&G back to balanced, consistent, reliable, 
and sustainable value creation for consumers, customers, 
shareholders and employees. We are focused on the future.  
We are determined to win.

Dear Fellow Shareholders,
2010 was a turning point for Citigroup. We achieved our 
primary goal of returning to profitability, posting positive net 
income in each quarter, a full-year profit of $10.6 billion and a 
$14.9 billion profit in the core businesses that will determine 
our company’s future. The U.S. government sold its shares of 
common stock in our company — in the process earning the 
taxpayers a more than $12 billion profit on their investment.  
We made more progress in reducing assets in Citi Holdings than 
anyone expected and ended the year with Holdings constituting 
less than 20% of our balance sheet. We attracted top talent, 
including new executives to run our U.S. Consumer Bank and 
Cards businesses. And, most important, we put in place a 
structure and a strategy that we believe will enable us not only 
to grow but to regain our company’s place as the world’s 
premier international bank.
Several large trends are reshaping the financial services 
industry. As America’s only truly global bank, Citigroup is the 
best-positioned bank in the world to harness those trends and 
deliver value to our clients and shareholders. We inherited a 
great foundation. Thanks to the foresight of those who were 
running this bank since before many of us were born, our 
company maintains an unparalleled physical presence in more 
than 100 of the world’s countries and jurisdictions, with 
business operations in some 60 more. That foundation gives us 
a strong head start. And we are working to build on it in ways 
that aspiring competitors simply cannot — because they lack 
our history, our unique assets and our global presence.
2010 Results
Before I go into more detail about our strategy and execution 
priorities, let me briefly review our full-year results. One year 
ago, no one would have predicted that Citi would earn a profit 
in every quarter of 2010 and post double-digit net income for 
the full year. But that’s exactly what we did.
2
Vikram S. Pandit 
Chief Executive Officer
Citi earned a profit of $10.6 billion in 2010, or $0.35 per share. 
Both of these figures are up sharply from a net loss of $1.6 
billion, or $0.80 per share, in 2009. Revenues on a comparable 
basis were down slightly — to $86.6 billion in 2010 from $91.1 
billion in 2009. Most of that decline is attributable to the 
continued shrinking of Citi Holdings both in dollar terms and as 
a share of our balance sheet.
Our core businesses in Citicorp earned profits on a comparable 
basis of $14.9 billion on revenues of $65.6 billion — down 
slightly, reflecting the especially strong Securities and Banking 
results from the prior year. Regional Consumer Banking and 
Global Transaction Services (GTS) both posted solid revenue 
gains. In particular, our businesses in Asia Pacific and Latin 
America continue to grow, with our  international  consumer 
banks leading the way with revenue gains of 9% and a doubling 
of net income to $4.2 billion. Overall, Citicorp generated 59% 
of its revenues from its international operations — a powerful 
testament to the strength of our global brand.
Our strong focus on Citicorp was matched by an equally strong 
determination to continue winding down Citi Holdings in an 
economically rational manner. Through a number of important 
sales and other actions — including the divestiture of

driving strong return on assets. Having achieved sustained

profitability, we now are looking to create sustained and

by more than half, from $8.9 billion in 2009 to $4.2 billion  
last year.
Current Trends
Provisions for credit losses and for benefits and claims also 
declined on a comparable basis — by $25.7 billion, or 50%,  
Our core goal for the near term is to continue aligning our  
bank around what we believe are the major trends reshaping

down $447 million, or 1%, from 2009 — even as we continue  
to make ongoing investments in talent, technology, new 
products, customer acquisition and expanded distribution, 
among others — ensuring that we have the people and the 
platform to meet clients’ and customers’ expectations well  
into this century.

1) The rise of an emerging-market consumer and trading bloc: 
Growth in emerging markets is hardly a new story, but the 
traditional narrative is perhaps a bit behind current reality.  
The basic facts are well-known. Emerging markets are growing 
consistently faster than developed economies, in some cases 
by many multiples.
Yet two deeper factors are driving this broader trend. The first 
is the rise of the emerging-market consumer and that new

Our capital strength continues to be among the best in the 
business. Our Tier 1 Common ratio increased from 9.6% to 
10.8% over the course of the year. And our loan loss reserves 
stand at $40.7 billion, or 6.3% of our loan balances.
The numbers, in other words, are strong. I know that return on 
equity is of particular importance to shareholders. We will have 
more to say about return on equity as the impact of all the new 
China and India alone, middle class households are expected to 
grow by more than 300 million over the next decade. Last year, 
70 million people living in emerging markets entered the 
middle class. According to one estimate, by 2020, three- 
quarters of incremental consumer spending will come from 
emerging markets. If that estimate is correct, then by that 
same year, consumer spending in Asia will overtake North 
America to become the world’s largest consumer bloc.
The other major factor is the vast increase in trade and capital 
flows within emerging markets. The share of global trade from 
emerging markets rose from 21% in 1995 to 35% in 2009, and 
that share is rising slightly faster than their share of the global 
economy. While intra-emerging market flows represent less 
than 15% of global trade today, these flows are increasing 
rapidly — rising from 6% of world trade to 13% between 1995 
and 2009. By contrast, the advanced economies’ share of 
global trade is now 65%, down from 79% in 1995.

  as of January 1, 2010.
Sovereign wealth funds represent a $4 trillion capital pool that 
will only grow larger as global current account imbalances, 
driven by trade surpluses in several Asian and Middle Eastern 
countries, continue to swell. These funds have large and 
fast-growing needs for solid investments in which to put their 
money. As a result, they are likely to play an important role in 
making up for capital investment shortfalls that may arise as 
3) Changes in consumer preferences: A new generation of 
globally minded and tech-savvy people is coming of age and 
entering the financial system. Globalization has harmonized,  
to some extent, these consumers’ tastes, spending habits  
and expectations in ways that make people who live in the 
world’s largest and most sophisticated urban centers more  
like one another than ever before. These consumers also have 
 different — and higher — expectations from businesses than 
their parents. The demands on businesses that rely on 
 information technology will be especially high: consumers  
have come to expect instant, fast, reliable, always-on access  
to a plethora of data. In addition, consumers in differing 
 circumstances and markets increasingly demand products  
and services tailored to their specific needs.
Keeping up with — and staying ahead of — those expectations 
will require changes to the global retail banking business model 
that are every bit as significant as the changes being wrought 
by new regulation. Social networking and technology pose 
perhaps the greatest challenge. More than 750 million people 
around the world now use social networking sites, which are 
radically changing the way consumers communicate — with 
each other and with businesses. What used to be simple 
messages are now interactive and ongoing dialogues. 
 Industries and businesses that succeed in the new environment 
are  harnessing social network technology to offer highly 
 personalized service and virtual, online communities.

5) Large global unbanked population: While the expansion of 
the global middle class will drive economic growth and demand 
for banking services, there currently are some 2.5 billion 
unbanked consumers — people who lack access to basic 
financial services — in the world today. While much of this 
population lives in emerging markets, there is a need for 
greater financial inclusion in developed economies as well. For 
example, in the U.S., about 8% of households do not have bank 
accounts — a figure that may rise with the implementation of

Policymakers have tried to address the problem but have yet to 
develop a workable — and scalable — model to promote financial 
inclusion and reach the poorest and most remote communities. 
One promising avenue is the use of mobile phone technologies 
to facilitate payments and deliver other banking services to the 
unbanked population.
How Our Company Aligns with These Trends
Our “globality,” brand and product breadth make us unique in 
the industry and provide us the opportunity to attract the best 
talent from all over the world. The best people know that a 
career with us offers more opportunities for their own growth 
and development.
And our nearly 200-year-old brand is one of the world’s 
strongest. It has weathered the financial crisis remarkably well 
and remains dominant in many of the emerging markets poised 
Citi is, overall, the world’s best-positioned bank to harness 
for the fastest growth in the coming years.
current trends.
Citi’s extensive global presence and network are unmatched 
among financial institutions. We’ve developed deep and 
long-standing relationships in every market where we operate. 
We can fund projects and lend money using local deposits and 
investments. And our long-term presence has allowed us to 
accumulate a wealth of local knowledge and insights.
Moreover, we link the world not only through knowledge and 
relationships but also through our global payments network to 
create efficiency and accessibility for our clients. These 
services allow us to play a major role in global trade and 
commerce and to develop broad and deep relationships with 
corporations, governments and institutional investors 
 throughout the world. Citi banks no less than 85% of the 
world’s Fortune 1,000 companies.
Citi’s broad product set is aligned with our core strategy of 
being the world’s global bank for consumers and institutions. 
Looking at these trends from the perspective of our three core 
businesses — Securities and Banking, Global Transaction 
 Services and Regional Consumer Banking — our advantages 
come into sharper focus.
In Securities and Banking, our approach is to leverage our 
global network to build deep, enduring relationships with some 
5,000 global priority clients across the corporate, public and 
financial sectors. We believe that these clients represent the 
most concentrated current and future opportunities. We put 
our capital to work for these clients and earn significant 
revenue streams from trading, foreign exchange, advisory and 
other services. And we are working to develop the risk 
 management and operations and technology functions into 
sources of competitive advantage.
In Global Transaction Services (GTS), we are leveraging our 
global network, technology platforms and industry expertise to

most attractive businesses in our industry.
In Regional Consumer Banking, we are pursuing a strategy of 
appealing to affluent consumers in the top 150 international 
cities. Nearly half of our 2010 consumer banking revenues were 
generated in emerging markets, where margins are higher and 
growth prospects brighter. We will continue to invest in more 
and better branches in our priority urban markets, even as we 
create “perceptual scale” through innovative distribution 
channels and products and digital banking platforms that make 
our service both more effective and more ubiquitous. We are 
the bank of choice for globally minded consumers and are 
working to become the same for trade-oriented small and 
mid-size companies looking to fulfill their international needs.
These three business segments overlap in a variety of ways  
to create synergies that significantly improve client service  
and our results. Our goal — and expectation — is to derive  
half of our revenues from emerging markets and half from 
 developed economies, with a balanced mix across these three 
key businesses.

3) Enhance our U.S. consumer business and provide an

new strategy to revitalize our U.S. retail banking business. 
We’re making major investments in people, in technology and in 
our branch network to ensure that our customer experience is 
Key Execution Priorities
second to none.
We have identified eight key execution priorities for 2011  
and beyond:
1) Increase our share of emerging-market flows, including 
capital trade and flows. In 2010, we sharpened our focus on 
capturing a larger share of capital trade and flows from, into 
and especially within emerging markets. Plans for the future 
4) Become the industry’s #1 source of ideas and content. 
Meaningful value is delivered through ideas. We want to be the 
best at conveying insights and analysis to clients. We plan to 
leverage our global presence and expertise, including our vast 
information advantage, to generate the freshest thinking and 
create the best content in our industry. No financial institution 
include improving client coverage models, adding and moving 
key talent to and within key markets, investing in infrastructure, 
knows more about more global markets than we do. Our 
challenge is to harness that knowledge and make it work  
creating content that provides unique insights into emerging 
for clients.
markets and making more capital available to clients in  
priority markets.
2) Become the world’s digital bank. Consumers appreciate the 
way technology simplifies and enhances so many aspects of 
their lives; they are increasingly demanding the same from 
5) Provide best-in-class corporate and investment banking 
capabilities. Our goal is to rise to a position such that no major 
corporation, government or institution in the world will make a 
major financial decision without consulting Citi. This requires 
the best talent, the best ideas and the harnessing of all that our 
financial services. We believe that our global footprint and our 
global franchise has to offer.
innovative culture position us to win in the digital space. Digital 
trends also will significantly impact our institutional businesses, 
whether through improvements in business efficiencies, more 
dynamic trading approaches or better ways to deliver services 
to our clients. In addition, we will continue to drive our 
 operations and technology agenda — which includes improving 
6) Connect with our customers. Citi’s global brand is a 
tremendous advantage. We are continually investing in our 
brand and finding the right and best ways to connect with 
customers. We’ve implemented a rigorous net promoter 
methodology around the world to measure customer 
 satisfaction and detail specific client characteristics and needs.

We are growing in digital and social media — channels that drive 
expenses as we work to comply with regulatory changes. Some 
meaningful client connections and help us learn what they want 
of these expenditures will be funded through re-engineering 
from their bank.
7) Attract, develop and retain the best talent. Here we have 
another built-in advantage. Citi’s global presence, long history, 
iconic brand, and breadth and depth of relationships and 
products offer employees — actual and potential — an 
 unequaled chance to hone their skills, learn new markets and 
projects, cost savings and other efficiencies. But the goal for 
every dollar we spend is to maintain our momentum and 
competitive edge, capture more market share and grow 
organically in priority markets. We are working hard and smart 
to position our company for the future.
work in a variety of businesses. The best talent in the industry 
Conclusion
knows this and is attracted to come and work for us. We will 
build on that advantage with world-class learning and 
 development offerings that support employees in their current 
jobs and prepare them for future roles. We also are focusing on 
our on-campus recruiting efforts to share the best of what Citi 
can offer and engage the interest and commitment of the most 
capable students around the world. And we are developing 
future leaders, building our pipeline of leadership talent to 
execute our strategy and fuel our growth in the future. The 
foundation we are laying today will help us retain our edge 
years down the road.
8) Promote financial inclusion. Part of the mission of any 
financial institution should be to promote financial inclusion —
and it is for us. The Citi Foundation partners with and supports 
a variety of non-profit organizations that work to bring  financial 
services within reach of the world’s 2.5 billion unbanked. We 
also work through our business lines to promote financial 
inclusion through various for-profit initiatives. We will allocate 
greater time and resources to mapping our strategy and 
execution plans to become the leading financial institution in 
promoting financial inclusion.
We are in the process of making carefully planned, long-term 
investments to support these priorities — and to attract new 
customers, provide exceptional service, deepen client 
 relationships, and create new and innovative products and 
services. These investments include adding new branches, 
ATMs and personal bankers in our priority cities around the 
world. We are upgrading our technology platforms in both our 
consumer and institutional businesses to improve the customer 
experience and create new efficiencies. We are hiring 
 corporate, investment and private bankers to help our clients 
We had a good year. Our task for the future is to ensure that  
we have even better years to come — by serving clients,  
building value for all our stakeholders and practicing 
 Responsible Finance.
I know we can do it because of what I already have seen our 
people accomplish. Their tireless work helped us get through 
the crisis. Moving Citi into the next phase will not be any easier. 
The best players in any business always expect the competition 
to be fierce and the challenges to be daunting. But our people 
are up to the task, and I thank them for their hard work 
throughout last year and all the effort that I know is to come.  
I also want to thank our Directors for their support and trust 
and for their continuing guidance.
I want, once again, to thank the American taxpayers for their 
steadfast support during and after the financial crisis. 
 Accepting their assistance was not something we ever 
 envisioned having to do, and it certainly was not something we 
wanted to do. But it enabled us to continue to provide our 
millions of retail, corporate and public sector clients with 
 uninterrupted service and helped to stabilize the financial 
system. I’m proud that Citi was able to provide the taxpayers 
with a substantial return on their investment. We paid the 
money back, but our debt of gratitude remains.
Finally, I want to thank you — my fellow shareholders — for your 
support as well. We know full well that you can choose where to

7   REPORT OF THE SUPERVISORY BOARD
Dear Shareholders,
Despite the volatile conditions prevailing on various markets, the BMW Group finished the financial year 
2015 with another outstanding earnings performance, reaffirming its position as market leader in the 
premium segment.
The BMW Group is now headed by Harald Krüger, who became the new Chairman of the Board of 
Management on 13 May 2015. With this carefully planned generational change at the top of the Board of 
Management, the Supervisory Board has not only ensured personnel continuity, it has also made an 
impor tant contribution to shaping the future strategy of the BMW Group.
Main emphases of the Supervisory Board’s monitoring and advisory activities  The Supervisory Board 
performed the duties charged to it in accordance with the law and the Articles of Incorporation with the 
utmost care. Throughout the financial year 2015, the Supervisory Board closely monitored the BMW Group’s 
business performance and macroeconomic developments on important markets, diligently supervised the 
governance of the Board of Management and advised it on significant projects and plans.
In a total of five meetings, the Supervisory Board deliberated at great length on the current business and 
financial situation of the Group. Further topics of particular focus and consultation at Supervisory Board 
meetings were corporate strategy (including a whole range of key topics involving the future shape of 
business), corporate forecasts and the strategy and management of the Financial Services segment. In addi-
tion, decisions were taken regarding personnel changes on the Board of Management and with respect to 
corporate governance.
Furthermore, the Supervisory Board attentively monitored the BMW Group’s business performance, 
both at scheduled meetings and at other times, as the need arose. In particular, the Board of Management 
provided regular reports on current sales and workforce figures. The Chairman of the Board of Management 
kept the Chairman of the Supervisory Board well informed, both promptly and directly, on the progress 
of important business projects and plans of strategic significance. In addition to scheduled meetings, 
Dr Friedrich Eichiner, member of the Board of Management responsible for Finance, and Dr Karl-Ludwig Kley, 
the Chairman of the Supervisory Board’s Audit Committee, consulted with each other directly at other times.
In its regular reports on the financial condition of the Group, the Board of Management provided infor-
mation on sales volume developments, market competition issues relevant for the Automotive and Motorcycles 
segments, and changes in the size of the workforce. The Board of Management also dealt with questions re-
garding economic developments and the prospects of the world’s key regions. On the Financial Services side 
of the business, the Board of Management provided regular updates on new business with retail customers 
and changes in the portfolio of contracts with dealerships and retail customers as well as the total volume of 
business. In its regular reports on the financial condition of the Group, the Board of Management also 
 reported to the Supervisory Board on any variances from budget.
Major transactions and projects were highlighted in the Board of Management’s reports on business 
developments, and deliberated on in subsequent discussions. For example, the Supervisory Board was kept 
informed of the status of acquisition projects, such as the joint acquisition of the navigation data provider 
HERE in conjunction with other partners as well as the purchase of a leasing company in China. Furthermore, 
the Board of Management reported on the BMW Group’s compliance with emissions limits and confirmed 
that no distinction is made between “dyno mode” and on-road testing when measuring the exhaust emissions 
of BMW Group vehicles. Over the course of the year under report, the two boards discussed at length eco-
nomic developments and business performance in China. Other subjects of discussion were progress in the 
field of electric mobility, product quality and customer satisfaction.
Furthermore, the Board of Management provided detailed information on both the ongoing status and 
its plans for expanding capacities at various BMW Group production sites.

At the first Supervisory Board meeting of the year, the Board of Management presented the new and 
updated models scheduled for market launch in the course of 2015.
One of the Supervisory Board meetings was held at the Landshut (Germany) site, at which the focus was 
placed on purchasing strategy and the significance of BMW component-producing plants in terms of pur-
chasing and production. The Board of Management also elaborated on the requirements that result from the 
distribution of sales volume and production sites across the world for the Group’s purchasing team and 
discussed with the Supervisory Board the measures necessary to establish a capable supplier base in growth 
markets. During its visit to the plant, the Supervisory Board inspected the foundry as well as the production 
facilities for electric motors and CFRP components.
The main topics discussed at a two-day meeting of the Supervisory Board held during the second half of 
the year were business and product strategy as well as long-term corporate planning.
During the first part of the meeting, the Board of Management reported on the results of the annual 
Number ONE corporate strategy review. The Board of Management also provided information on the planned 
further development of the Group’s vehicle portfolio and its intention to continue its collaboration with 
Toyota. In view of the increasing regulation of toxic emissions on key markets, the two boards discussed the 
challenges facing the Group in the field of alternative drive technologies going forward and the strategic 
importance of electric mobility. The Board of Management also reported in depth on topics relating to the 
changing market environment and potential business opportunities emerging in connection with digitalisation 
and vehicle connectivity, and provided an overview of its plans and activities in this field. The Supervisory 
Board also gathered facts and figures on the BMW lightweight construction strategy.
As part of a series of vehicle presentations, members of the Supervisory Board took the opportunity to 
drive selected BMW and MINI models on a test track, including the latest BMW 7 Series. Furthermore, the 
current state of progress of selected vehicle development projects was presented and explained to the 
Super visory Board.
In the second part of the meeting, the Supervisory Board deliberated at length on the long-term corporate 
forecast presented by the Board of Management for the years 2016 to 2021. The Board of Management also 
described various crisis scenarios to the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board lauded the management 
team’s efforts to keep a tight control over fixed costs. After thorough examination and lengthy discussion, 
the Supervisory Board gave the plans its formal approval.
The performance and strategic direction of the Financial Services segment as well as risk management 
in this area were also reported on. The consequences of stricter regulation of financial services were also 
discussed.
The Supervisory Board deliberated on the annual budget presented by the Board of Management for the 
financial year 2016, including the main external influencing factors identified.
Again in 2015, the Personnel Committee and the full Supervisory Board examined both the structure and 
the amount of compensation that Board of Management members receive. In addition to reviewing trends 
in business performance and board compensation on a multi-year basis, consideration was also given to the 
development of the remuneration of senior management and employees of BMW AG within Germany over the 
course of time. An external compensation consultant, independent of both the Board of Management and 
BMW AG, was called upon to provide expert advice and assist the Supervisory Board in the evaluation of DAX 
compensation studies. After a careful review, the Supervisory Board concluded that the level of compen-
sation of board members, including pension entitlements, is appropriate and that the compensation system 
has proved its worth. The Supervisory Board therefore resolved not to propose any changes to the system of 
Board of Management compensation in 2015.

9   REPORT OF THE SUPERVISORY BOARD
Further information on the compensation of Board of Management members is provided in the Compen-
sation Report (see section “Statement on Corporate Governance”).
In 2015, the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board again conducted an in-depth review of the 
corporate governance standards currently in place in the BMW Group as well as the rules set out in the German 
Corporate Governance Code. In the most recent Declaration of Compliance issued in December 2015, both 
boards decided that the BMW Group should comply with all of the recommendations issued by the German 
Government Corporate Governance Code Commission on 12 June 2015, except for the disclosure of Board of 
Management members’ compensation in prescribed model tables, as the Supervisory Board is of the opinion 
that these tables do not improve the clarity and comprehensibility of the Compensation Report. The wording 
of the Declaration of Compliance is contained in the Corporate Governance Report.
Both the Personnel Committee and the Supervisory Board again asked the Board of Management to 
describe the state of progress in implementing the BMW Group’s diversity concept. This programme not only 
relates to gender diversity, it also promotes both cultural diversity and a balanced mixture of age groups 
among staff. The Board of Management also reported on the percentage of and development of female execu-
tives at various management levels within the Group and the targets determined by the Board of Management 
for the two executive levels immediately below it. In addition, the Board of Management reported to the 
Supervisory Board on measures to develop young talent for future strategic fields of expertise.
The Supervisory Board also consulted on the consequences of legislation relating to the equal participation 
of women and men in management positions in Germany for the BMW Group’s two boards. As its target for 
the proportion of women on the Board of Management by 31 December 2016, the Supervisory Board 
has stipulated that the Board of Management should continue to have at least one female member. Assuming 
the Board of Management continues to comprise eight members, this would correspond to a ratio of at least 
12.5 %. The fact that the Supervisory Board considers it desirable to increase the proportion of women on the 
board further supports the Board of Management’s current raft of measures, which is also aimed at increasing 
the proportion of women at the highest executive management levels of the BMW Group.
The legal minimum of 30 per cent of female and male members in the Supervisory Board that came into 
force on 1 January 2016 is already being complied with, both in terms of the Supervisory Board in its entirety 
and also for both shareholder and employee representatives.
The Supervisory Board decided upon specific appointment objectives for its own composition based on 
a detailed composition profile, a description of which is provided in the Corporate Governance Report. In 
line with a new recommendation contained in the German Corporate Governance Code, the appointment 
objectives have been supplemented to include a maximum length of office on the Supervisory Board. Based 
on a self-assessment, the Supervisory Board determined that its composition at 31 December 2015 complied 
with its appointment objectives.
In the financial year 2015, the Personnel Committee took the decision to disburse any costs to current and 
former members of the Board of Management that could arise in connection with a civil action brought by a 
former supplier in the USA. As a former member of the Board of Management, I did not personally vote on 
this resolution, which was taken as a precautionary measure.
Apart from this matter, there were no indications of possible conflicts of interest on the part of Supervisory 
Board members in the financial year 2015. Significant transactions with Supervisory Board members and 
other related parties as defined by IAS 24, including close relatives and intermediate entities, are monitored 
in the form of quarterly requests for relevant information.
The Supervisory Board endeavours to assess and continuously improve the efficiency of its work, including 
that of its committees. Once a year, the efficiency examination is dealt with as a separate agenda point, at 

--- Page 10 ---
10
which the members of the Board of Management are not present. Preparations for the examination are 
 facilitated by means of a questionnaire. As a result of the efficiency examination, suggestions for additional 
topics of report were made during the year under report.
Each of the five Supervisory Board meetings in 2015 was attended on average by 95 per cent of its members, 
a fact that can be corroborated by the analysis of attendance fees for individual members, as disclosed in the 
Compensation Report. None of the members of the Supervisory Board took part in only half or less than half 
of the meetings of the Supervisory Board, the Presiding Board or the committees to which the members 
belong during their terms of office in the period under report.
Description of Presiding Board activities and committee work  In order to work more efficiently and 
prepare complex issues and decisions with greater thoroughness, the Supervisory Board has established a 
Presiding Board and several committees. A description of the duties, composition and working procedures 
of these committees is provided in the Corporate Governance Report.
The relevant chairmen reported at length on the status of Presiding Board and committee work at the 
subsequent Supervisory Board meeting.
In a total of four meetings, the Presiding Board focused mainly on preparing topics for the meetings of 
the full Supervisory Board, unless these fell under the remit of one of the committees. The treatment of more 
extensive issues, such as the Long-term Business Forecast and the Annual Strategic Review, was prepared by 
the Presiding Board on the basis of written and oral reports provided by Board of Management members and 
senior department heads. The Presiding Board selected further topics of discussion for Supervisory Board 
meetings and made suggestions to the Board of Management regarding items to be included in its reports to 
the full Supervisory Board.
The Audit Committee held four meetings and three telephone conference calls during 2015. In those 
telephone conference calls, the Audit Committee deliberated with the Board of Management on each of the 
BMW Group’s Quarterly Reports, prior to their publication. Representatives of the external auditors were 
present during the telephone conference call held to present the Interim Financial Report for the six-month 
period ended 30 June 2015. The report had been subjected to review by the external auditors.
The Audit Committee meeting held in spring 2015 was primarily dedicated to preparing the Supervisory 
Board meeting at which the financial statements were examined. Prior to proposing KPMG AG Wirtschafts-
prüfungs gesellschaft for election as Company and Group auditor at the Annual General Meeting 2015, the 
Audit Committee obtained a Declaration of Independence from the proposed auditor. The Audit Committee 
also considered the scope and composition of non-audit services, including tax advisory services provided by 
KPMG entities to the BMW Group. There were no indications of conflicts of interest, grounds for exclusion 
or lack of independence on the part of the auditor.
The fee proposals for the audit of the year-end Company and Group Financial Statements 2015 and the 
review of the six-month Interim Financial Report were deemed appropriate by the Audit Committee. Sub-
sequent to the Annual General Meeting 2015, the Audit Committee therefore appointed KPMG AG for the 
relevant engagements and specified audit focus areas.
The Head of Group Controlling reported to the Audit Committee on the current risk profile and on risk 
management processes and developments within the BMW Group.
The Head of Group Financial Reporting provided a description of various aspects of the internal control 
system (ICS) underlying financial reporting and explained measures being taken to further improve the system. 
Testing performed during the year under report did not highlight any material ICS weaknesses that could 
jeopardise the system’s effectiveness.

11   REPORT OF THE SUPERVISORY BOARD
The Chairman of the BMW Group Compliance Committee reported to the Audit Committee on the 
current compliance situation, which, as in the previous year, was deemed satisfactory overall. None of the 
information received relating to potential non-compliance or actual incidences of non-compliance identified 
in specific cases give any indication of serious or systematic non-compliance with applicable requirements. 
Moreover, the Audit Committee requested and received information regarding the further expansion of the 
BMW Group Compliance Organisation.
The Head of Group Internal Audit reported to the Audit Committee on significant findings of audits con-
ducted by Group Internal Audit on the industrial and financial services sides of the business. In addition, 
he provided information on the main topics of planned audits in both areas.
The Audit Committee has already obtained detailed information regarding audit reforms within the EU, 
particularly with respect to preparing the selection of the auditor.
The Audit Committee and Supervisory Board obtained an auditor’s assurance report regarding compliance 
with regulatory requirements for off-market transactions made by BMW AG involving derivatives. The effec-
tiveness of the system that BMW AG currently employs to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements 
was confirmed. With an addition to its procedural rules, the Supervisory Board transferred tasks related to 
examinations of this type to the Audit Committee.
The Audit Committee concurred with the decision of the Board of Management to raise the Company’s 
share capital in accordance with § 4 (5) of the Articles of Incorporation (Authorised Capital 2014) by € 309,860 
and to issue a corresponding number of new non-voting bearer shares of preferred stock, each with a par value 
of € 1, at favourable conditions to employees.
The Personnel Committee convened four times during the financial year 2015. One of its tasks is to prepare 
decisions relating to the composition of the Board of Management. In one case, the Personnel Committee 
gave its approval for a member of the Board of Management to accept a mandate for membership of the 
supervisory board of a non-BMW Group entity.
The Nomination Committee convened twice in 2015 to deliberate on successor planning for mandates of 
the shareholders’ representatives and adopt recommendations for proposals for election at the 2015 and 
2016 Annual General Meetings, taking the composition objectives stipulated by the Supervisory Board into 
due account.
The statutory Mediation Committee was not required to convene during the financial year 2015.
Composition and organisation of the Board of Management  After the Annual General Meeting held 
on 13 May 2015, I resigned from the Board of Management as previously announced and Harald Krüger took 
over as Chairman of the Board of Management. The Supervisory Board had previously appointed Oliver Zipse 
as member of the Board of Management for the first time with effect from the end of the Annual General 
Meeting. Mr Zipse has worked for the BMW Group since 1991, most recently as head of Group Planning and 
Product Strategy. He took over responsibility for Production from Harald Krüger. In the financial year 2015, 
the Supervisory Board resolved to extend the mandate of one Board of Management member.
Composition of the Supervisory Board, the Presiding Board and Supervisory Board Committees  In 
order to facilitate the generational change at the top of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board, 
which he both planned and personally supported, Professor Joachim Milberg resigned from the Supervisory 
Board immediately after the 2015 Annual General Meeting. As previously announced, he will be playing a 
leading role in the worldwide social engagement and philanthropic work of BMW AG, in particular as Chair-
man of the Board of Trustees of the BMW Foundation Herbert Quandt. Professor Milberg has faithfully served 
and had a major influence on the BMW Group over a period of many years, beginning in 1993, first as 

--- Page 12 ---
12
member and then as Chairman of the Board of Management from 1999. As from 2002 he served firstly as 
member and finally, from 2005, as Chairman of the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board wishes to 
take this opportunity to express its great respect for, and appreciation of, Professor Milberg’s achievements.
Wolfgang Mayrhuber also resigned from the Supervisory Board at his own request at the end of the 2015 
Annual General Meeting. The Supervisory Board wishes to thank Mr Mayrhuber for his more than ten years 
of valuable, trusted cooperation.
Simone Menne was elected to the Supervisory Board as new shareholder representative. Professor Dr 
Henning Kagermann was re-elected as member of the Supervisory Board at the Annual General Meeting in 
2015.
After my election to the Supervisory Board by the Annual General Meeting in 2015, the Supervisory Board 
members elected me as their new Chairman. In this capacity, and in accordance with the relevant terms of 
reference, I remained Chairman of the Personnel and Nomination Committees. I was also elected member of 
the Audit Committee. The Corporate Governance Report contains a summary of the composition of the 
Supervisory Board and its committees.
Examination of financial statements and the profit distribution proposal  KPMG AG Wirtschaftsprüfungs-
gesellschaft conducted a review of the abridged Interim Group Financial Statements and Interim Group 
Management Report for the six-month period ended 30 June 2015. The results of the review were presented 
to the Audit Committee by representatives of KPMG AG Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft. No issues were iden-
tified that might indicate that the abridged Interim Group Financial Statements and Interim Group Manage-
ment Report had not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the applicable provisions.
The Group and Company Financial Statements of Bayerische Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft for the 
year ended 31 December 2015 and the Combined Management Report – as authorised for issue by the 
Board of Management on 18 February 2016 – were audited by KPMG AG Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft 
and given an unqualified audit opinion.
The Financial Statements and the Combined Management Report, the long-form audit reports of the 
external auditors and the Board of Management’s profit distribution proposal were made available to all 
members of the Supervisory Board in a timely manner.
In a first step, the Audit Committee dutifully examined and discussed these documents at a meeting held 
on 25 February 2016. The Supervisory Board subsequently examined the relevant drafts of the Board of 
Management at its meeting on 9 March 2016, after hearing the committee chairman’s report on the meeting of 
the Audit Committee. In both meetings, the Board of Management gave a detailed explanation of the fi-
nancial reports it had prepared. Representatives of the external auditors attended both meetings, reported 
on significant findings and answered any additional questions raised by the members of the Supervisory 
Board. They also confirmed that the risk management system established by the Board of Management is 
capable of identifying any events or developments that might impair the going-concern status of the Company 
and that no material weaknesses in the internal control system and risk management system were found 
with regard to the financial reporting process. Similarly, they confirmed that they had not identified any facts 
in the course of their audit work that were inconsistent with the contents of the Declaration of Compliance 
issued jointly by the two boards.
Based on thorough examinations at both Audit Committee and full Supervisory Board level, the Super-
visory Board concurred with the results of the external audit. In accordance with the conclusion reached after 
the examination by the Audit Committee and Supervisory Board, no objections were raised. The Group and 
Company Financial Statements of Bayerische Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft for the financial year 2015 
prepared by the Board of Management were approved at the Supervisory Meeting held on 9 March 2016. The 
separate financial statements have therefore been adopted.

--- Page 13 ---
13   REPORT OF THE SUPERVISORY BOARD
The Supervisory Board also examined the proposal of the Board of Management to use the unappropriated 
profit to pay an increased dividend of € 3.20 per share of common stock and € 3.22 per share of non-voting 
preferred stock. The Supervisory Board considers the proposal appropriate and therefore concurs with it.
Expression of appreciation by the Supervisory Board  The financial year 2015 has again been a record 
year for the BMW Group. The Supervisory Board wishes to thank the members of the Board of Management 
and the entire staff of the BMW Group worldwide for their outstanding work and concerted performance.

15   STATEMENT OF THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT
Dear Shareholders,
The 7 March 2016 marked an historic milestone in the history of our company. 100 years of Bayerische 
 Motoren Werke is the achievement of all the company’s associates since its founding in 1916 right up until 
today. Our experiences and strengths establish the foundation for our future. However, we also know that 
it is not past accomplishments but profitable growth, strength in innovation and competitiveness that deter-
mine the success of a company. This is why we are using the occasion of our centenary as a springboard for 
“The Next 100 Years”. This makes it clear that the company’s strategy is and remains geared towards the 
long term.
Successful development continued in the financial year 2015  The financial year 2015 was a successful 
year for the BMW Group. We achieved new all-time highs for performance indicators such as sales, Group 
revenues, Group profit before tax and net profit.
The strength of our premium brands is the backbone of our success  Our three premium brands fascinate 
people all around the world. In 2015, more than 2.2 million customers chose a BMW, MINI or Rolls-Royce, 
more than in any other year. This was a solid increase of 6.1 per cent over the previous year. For the first time 
in our corporate history, the BMW brand sold more than 1.9 million vehicles. With almost 137,000 motor-
cycles and scooters, BMW Motorrad also achieved a new record in sales. The MINI brand also reported the 
best year ever, with over 338,400 vehicles sold. Rolls-Royce Motor Cars delivered 3,785 vehicles to customers, 
making 2015 the second-best year in its 112-year history.
We continue to strive for a globally balanced distribution of value creation  We continue to pursue a balanced 
distribution of sales between the world’s three major regions, Europe, Asia and America. In view of the 
heterogeneous and volatile development of the markets, our distribution strategy allows us to respond more 
swiftly to fluctuations and to avoid overdependence on any single region. Europe is still our largest sales region. 
Last year we surpassed the mark of one million vehicles sold there for the very first time. Overall, close to 
45 per cent of our cars were delivered to customers in Europe. Asia accounted for approximately 30 per cent 
of sales, the Americas for 22 per cent.
We are strategically expanding our global production network of currently 30 sites in 14 countries. Our 
second engine plant in Shenyang opened in January 2016. In Mexico, preparations for the construction of our 
new plant in San Luis Potosí are proceeding according to schedule. On top of that, we are currently expanding 
the company’s largest production site in Spartanburg, USA in order to be able to meet the high demand 
for our premium sports activity vehicles.
Positive sales development reflected in key financials  Our successful development in sales is reflected in 
our key financials: with over 92 billion euros in sales revenues, the BMW Group posted a significant growth 
of 14.6 per cent over the previous year. As forecasted, the Group profit before tax achieved solid growth of 
5.9 per cent to a new high of 9.2 billion euros. The annual net profit increased by 10 per cent to around 6.4 billion 
euros. The EBIT margin in the Automotive segment stands at 9.2 per cent and therefore remains within our 
strategic target range.
With over 1.65 million new contracts with customers and a profit before tax of 1.98 billion euros, the 
 Financial Services segment once again made a significant contribution to the Group result. The EBT in the 
segment grew significantly to 14.6 per cent and stands well above the previous year’s level.
The Motorcycle segment is profitable due to its successful growth strategy. Based on an operating result 
of 182 million euros in 2015, the segment reported an EBIT margin of 9.1 per cent.
Therefore, we achieved the goals we set for the 2015 financial year and we managed to do so in an environ-
ment characterised by intense competition as well as economic and political volatility.

We continue to fascinate our customers with new models and technologies  In 2015, we launched a total 
of 15 new models and model revisions in the market, among them the new BMW 2 Series Gran Tourer, the 
new BMW X1 and the new MINI Clubman. At Rolls-Royce, the new Drophead Coupe called Dawn celebrated 
its world premiere at the International Motor Show in Frankfurt. The model is scheduled to be introduced 
in 2016. Most importantly, the model year 2015 was marked by the launch of the sixth generation of the new 
BMW 7 Series. With its high-end innovations, our flagship has set new benchmarks in driving dynamics, 
efficiency as well as driver assistance systems.
BMW i attracts new customer groups to the BMW brand  With Efficient Dynamics technology and especially 
with the BMW i models, the BMW Group has irreversibly charted the course towards sustainable mobility. 
At the end of 2015, average emissions for our new car fleet stood at 127 grams of CO2 per kilometre. Last 
year, we sold close to 30,000 BMW i vehicles – up around 66 per cent year-on-year. The fully electric BMW i3 is 
already available in 50 countries; it is also the only vehicle with a certified carbon balance for the supply chain, 
production, use and recycling. It has attracted new customers to the BMW brand – 80 per cent of i3 buyers 
have never driven a BMW before. We have repeatedly stressed that electromobility is not a sprint but a mara-
thon. In order to enable access to e-mobility to many people, the BMW i3 has been included in our DriveNow 
car-sharing fleet. Furthermore, the BMW Group and its partners support the establishment of a comprehensive 
charging infrastructure in Europe, China and the USA.
Consistent technology transfer from BMW i to the BMW core brand  The technologies developed for BMW i 
are now also being incorporated in the models of our BMW core brand. This includes battery cells, the elec-
tronic control unit and electric drives from the i3 and i8 as well as our expertise in lightweight construction. 
A good example of this technology transfer is the Carbon Core of the new BMW 7 Series, a mixed-material 
design for the car body structure made of carbon fibre reinforced plastics (CFRP), aluminum and steel. This 
Carbon Core received the EuroCarBody Award 2015, the world’s most prestigious recognition for innova-
tions in car body construction.
A broad range of innovative, efficient drivetrains plays a crucial role in adhering to the increasingly strin-
gent requirements for the reduction of emissions. BMW’s first plug-in hybrid series model has already been 
released: the X5 xDrive40e. As of July 2016, all BMW plug-in hybrid models will be offered under the label of 
“iPerformance” – from the BMW 2 Series Active Tourer to the BMW 7 Series. Furthermore, our iPerformance 
customers will benefit from a 360° Electric offer, including a wall-mounted charging box and more.
Realignment of the company with Strategy NUMBER ONE > NEXT  Our Strategy Number ONE has been 
the guideline for our actions since autumn 2007. Since the global economic and financial crisis, the company 
has developed successfully. At the same time, our environment has changed at a rapid pace. Digitalisation, 
in particular, has brought about new technological opportunities for the automobile industry, ranging from 
automated driving to connectivity in production.
Long-term growth targets up to 2020  In the light of these developments, we have revised and updated our 
strategy for the future. We are operating from a solid basis: the BMW Group successfully combines financial 
strength, innovation and profitability with further growth, and we intend to pursue this path further with 
Strategy NUMBER ONE > NEXT.
Our business model will continue to focus on individual mobility in the premium segment – combined 
with attractive mobility services. The customer is at the heart of everything we do. We are setting out long-
term targets that will guide us up to 2020 and are gradually implementing the related action plan.
Highly automated driving is becoming a part of the intelligent car of the future  With BMW ConnectedDrive, 
the BMW Group has been in a leading position when it comes to driver assistance systems for the past two 
decades. These systems improve safety and comfort for our customers.
At the 2015 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas we presented our self-driving BMW i3, which is 
able to avoid obstacles and park itself. At the CES 2016, we showcased the BMW i8 Vision Future Interaction,

Letter From Your CEO
For 2014, Intel reported record revenue of $55.9 billion, up 6% from 2013. Net income rose 22% to $11.7 
billion, and earnings per share were $2.31. Our operating income of $15.3 billion was up 25% over 
2013. We achieved record annual unit shipments for PCs, servers, tablets, phones, and the Internet of Things.
Our strategy for growth is playing out well. We are driving our core businesses in personal computing  
and the enterprise, building on those assets to move into new areas such as the Internet of Things and 
wearables, strengthening Intel’s position in mobile, and continuing our relentless pursuit of Moore’s Law.  
The diversity and scale of Intel products today put us in a unique position to compete across the breadth  
of devices that compute and connect. 
Growing our core businesses
In PC clients, revenue of $34.7 billion was up 4% over 2013. Operating income of $14.6 billion was up 25%. We introduced  
the Intel® Core™ M processor family, designed to enable superior compute and graphics performance and long battery life in 
razor-thin, fanless mobile devices. In Chromebooks*, Intel now leads in market segment share. In data center products, revenue 
was $14.4 billion, up 18% over 2013, and operating income increased 31% as we capitalized on the growth of cloud computing 
and big data. We introduced next-generation Intel® Xeon® processors that enhance performance, efficiency, and security for 
compute, storage, and network workloads in cloud environments. 
Our core businesses are also providing valuable intellectual property to help us compete in diverse computing markets. For example, 
certain models of the ultra-thin Dell Venue* 8 tablet ship with Intel® RealSense™ technology, a 3-D camera capability we originally 
created for PCs. Likewise, Intel® Atom™ processors, developed first as an extension of our PC products family, are found in 
smartphones and tablets, as well as storage, networking, and computing devices in the data center and Internet of Things.  
Progress in mobile
We exceeded our goal to ship 40 million units for tablets during 2014, and became one of the largest silicon providers for tablets. 
The first U.S. smartphone powered by Intel® processors was introduced. We are ramping crucial LTE communications products 
and began shipping our second-generation 7260 LTE baseband modem. Landmark agreements with Rockchip and Spreadtrum  
in China give us new sources of innovation and partners with whom to scale Intel® architecture products. In 2015 we look to 
improve mobile profitability by further reducing costs through efficiencies and products such as our SoFIA System-on-Chip 
targeted for the mobile market segment.  
Leading in emerging sectors
We have made investments and established positions in emerging growth sectors such as the Internet of Things and wearables 
before these segments become mainstream. Our Internet of Things revenue grew 19% in 2014, to more than $2 billion. We 
announced our Basis Peak™ fitness and sleep tracker and Intel® Curie™ module, a button-sized computer designed for wearables, 
and have established a growing portfolio of wearable technology collaborations with several world-class fashion and fitness brands. 
Moore’s Law: going strong at 50
In 1965, Intel co-founder Gordon Moore made his visionary observations about how integrated electronics would change our 
world through ever-shrinking, ever-cheaper silicon circuits. Fifty years later, “Moore’s Law” remains Intel’s heritage and is still 
our driving force. In 2014, we launched chips based on the world’s first 14-nanometer (nm) manufacturing process, and our 
10nm process is under development. As we further advance Moore’s Law, our silicon technology leadership will remain a valuable 
competitive advantage. 
Role model for corporate responsibility
Intel continues to be a leader in environmental sustainability, education, and community involvement. In 2014, we extended 
efforts to ensure ethical sourcing of minerals for our products, including “conflict minerals” from the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo (DRC) and adjoining countries. After accomplishing our goal to manufacture microprocessors that are DRC conflict-free  
for tantalum, tin, tungsten, and gold, we have set a new goal that all products on our roadmap for 2016 and beyond will be DRC 
conflict-free for these minerals. In January 2015, we also announced a broad Diversity in Technology initiative that includes our 
commitment to invest $300 million to support hiring and retaining of women and under-represented minorities at Intel and 
throughout the technology and gaming industries.  
It’s best with Intel
We solidified our strategy and executed it well in 2014, resulting in a very strong year for Intel. We sharpened our focus,  
accelerated our pace of innovation, and delivered stockholder return. As we move forward, we will continue our work to  
ensure that if it’s smart and connected, it is best with Intel.

Letter From Your Chairman
Financial Results
2014 was a year of significant and tangible  
progress for Intel.  
The financial achievements described in the CEO’s letter 
reflect the energies of a company that is changing. There  
is a renewed focus on discipline and results, and we are 
executing on our strategy to deliver value to stockholders. 
We have strengthened our resolve to be successful in the 
market and to take informed, appropriate business risks. 
We are determined to heed the lessons of history, adapt  
to changes in our environment, and lead with innovation.
Your Board of Directors has been listening to investor concerns and has taken  
a fresh look at its own responsibilities to stockholders. Our priorities in 2014 
included strategic clarity, cash policy, and Board composition.
The Board has actively engaged in discussions about the strategy behind Intel’s 
investments, to help make sure possible risks and returns for stockholders are 
clearly understood. We have seen progress in unprofitable businesses and are 
encouraged by new investments to capture strategic opportunities. 
In reviewing cash policy, the Board looks first at the needs of the business.  
Most of Intel’s investments focus on advanced technologies critical to business 
success. In 2014, Intel made capital investments of $10.1 billion, the largest 
portion of which was used to build and equip leading-edge manufacturing 
capacity. The company also spent $11.5 billion on research and development. 
About 70% of this was for technical capabilities and intellectual property, the 
costs and benefits of which are shared across Intel’s business segments. This 
broad and deep foundation allows us to integrate functions into the platform 
products that customers increasingly require.
After reviewing plans for the business, the Board considers the dividend and 
then stock repurchases. In 2014, the Board announced the first increase in the 
dividend since 2012, from $0.90 to $0.96 per share. It also authorized an 
acceleration of stock repurchases to return more cash to investors. Intel 
repurchased $10.8 billion worth of Intel stock in 2014, five times the level of 
2013. Through dividends and repurchases, Intel returned cash to stockholders  
in 2014 of $15.2 billion, more than two times the amount in 2013.  
These actions extend Intel’s commitment to deliver long-term value to owners.  
In the last five years, Intel returned $54.2 billion to stockholders through 
dividends and stock repurchases. Since 2009, the dividend has risen from  
$0.56 to $0.96 per share, and average shares outstanding have decreased  
from 5.6 to 5.1 billion shares.
With an eye to Intel’s future, the Board reviewed its composition to make sure  
it has the appropriate skills and experience for stewardship. We added a new 
Board member who brings more than 20 years of experience in enterprise 
software innovation and cloud computing, areas that are key to Intel’s business.
While pointing with pride to accomplishments, we understand there is more to 
do. Many of us are disciples of former Intel CEO and Chairman Andy Grove. In his 
world, there are no victory laps. Every day brings a new challenge, and we must 
never become complacent.
At the same time, the optimism about the future shared by all of Intel’s founders 
remains strong in Intel’s culture. Fifty years after Gordon Moore made his famous 
predictions for the future of integrated electronics, we believe the potential for 
innovation continues to be enormous.
Change is essential for innovation. We must continue to embrace change and 
innovate. Our goal is to continue the foundational technology investments and 
drive Intel’s profitability.

LETTER TO  
SHAREHOLDERS
Dear Fellow Shareholders:
2016 was an eventful year for our 
company, our country and the world. 
As the year progressed from a first 
half defined by economic anxiety and 
volatility to a second half impacted 
by a series of political upsets and 
surprises, we demonstrated the power 
and resilience of Citi’s unique global 
franchise by helping our millions of 
customers and clients around the world 
navigate an environment far more 
challenging than anticipated. 
The nearly $15 billion in net income 
we earned in 2016 is a reflection 
of the momentum we built across 
many of our core businesses while 
continuing to make the investments 
necessary for future growth. Among 
the many milestones we marked on 
the road to achieving our ultimate 
goal of being an indisputably strong 
and stable institution, I’d like to 
highlight the following:
In our Global Consumer Bank, we 
continued to focus our footprint with 
the announcement of plans to divest 
our retail banking and credit card 
businesses in Argentina, Brazil and 
Colombia, strategic decisions that 
enable us to consolidate our finite 
resources on our three major consumer 
markets: the U.S., Mexico and Asia. 
In the U.S., we converted 11 million 
Costco customers to our platform over 
a weekend in June while adding an 
additional 1 million new cardholders 
in the next six months. We also 
extended our nearly three-decade-long 
relationship with American Airlines and 
renewed an important partnership with 
The Home Depot.
In Mexico, where we enjoy scale and a 
strong market position, we rebranded 
our franchise Citibanamex and 
embarked on a multi-year $1 billion 
investment program that includes 
the modernization of our branches 
and upgrades to our technology. This 
investment reaffirms our long-standing 
commitment to our North American 
neighbor, and our continued confidence 
in its growth prospects.
We also made progress meeting the 
evolving needs of our customers by 
massively accelerating our mobile-first 
digital strategy. Our newly formed Citi 
FinTech unit spearheaded the first 
mobile app that combines banking, 
wealth management and money 
movement for our Citigold clients. 
And in Asia, we entered into promising 
partnerships with ride-hailing platform 
Grab, hospitality pioneer Airbnb 
and Lazada Group, a leading online 
shopping and selling site.
revenue and margin growth for the 12th 
consecutive quarter. Our #1 ranking in 
the influential Greenwich Associates’ 
Annual Survey for Global Fixed Income 
Market Share further confirmed that 
Citi has gained more market share 
in FICC than any of our competitors 
worldwide, and that our market shares 
in fixed-income and equities have risen 
to their highest point since the crisis.
We distinguished ourselves by advising 
on 10 transactions worth $140 billion 
in market value in a single week. These 
included advising Time Warner on its 
$108 billion transaction with AT&T, 
B/E Aerospace on its $8 billion sale 
to Rockwell Collins, TD Ameritrade on 
its $4 billion acquisition of Scottrade 
Financial Services and seven significant 
others. Over the course of the year, 
our bankers also served as advisors on 
other landmark transactions including 
to Dell and Silver Lake Partners on the 
$67 billion acquisition of EMC and to 
Baxalta on its $32 billion acquisition by 
Shire. Being named Bank of the Year  
for 2016 by International Financing 
Review recognized our position as an 
industry leader.
We also continued to make progress 
in our journey toward being a simpler, 
smaller, safer and stronger institution.
In our Institutional Clients Group, 
revenues rose 10 percent for the year 
in Fixed Income and Equities, while our 
industry-leading Treasury and Trade 
Solutions (TTS) business, the largest 
proprietary closed-loop mover of money 
in the world, generated year-over-year 
With the non-core assets in Citi 
Holdings down to just 3 percent of 
Citigroup’s balance sheet, we no longer 
will report Holdings results separately. 
At its peak, Holdings had more than

of producing multi-billion dollar losses

the year. And with a Supplementary 
Leverage Ratio of 7.2 percent, both ratios 
exceed regulatory requirements and 
show we have capacity to continue to 
increase the amount of capital we return.
All these milestones and achievements 
underscore what might easily constitute 
our boldest headline of the year: Our 
restructuring is over. Today, Citi has 
returned to its roots with two core 
businesses appropriately scaled to serve 
customers and clients who benefit from 
our global network and footprint. 
With a revenue base balanced across 
products and regions — firmly supported 
by a business model that would be 
difficult, if not impossible, to replicate 
in today’s environment — our unique 
and resilient global franchise is not only 
well-suited to meeting the needs of 
our customers and clients around the 
world but is also, importantly, beginning 
to produce the capital returns our 
investors expect and deserve.
Despite these accomplishments and 
our ongoing success, however, we 
recognize that with respect to the 
goals and targets we set for ourselves, 
our performance last year fell short. 
Specifically, our core Citicorp net 
income dropped from $16.3 billion 
in 2015 to $14.3 billion last year; our 
Citigroup Efficiency Ratio rose to  
59 percent in 2016 from 57 percent in 
2015; our Return on Assets decreased 
from 95 basis points in 2015 to 82 
basis points last year; and our Return 
on Tangible Common Equity (ROTCE) 
dropped from 9.3 percent in 2015 to  
7.6 percent last year.

in a single quarter. In contrast, its last 
quarter of results was its 10th straight 
with a profit, and we remain committed 
to keeping the portfolio at a break-
even level or better. Significantly, we 
were the only one of eight U.S. banks 
found by the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation and the Federal Reserve to 
have no deficiencies in our Resolution 
and Recovery Plan. 
And we meaningfully increased the 
amount of capital we return to our 
shareholders. In 2016, we returned 
nearly $11 billion in capital to you, and 
— combined with the announcement of 
an incremental increase of $1.8 billion 
we made in November — we raised

our total capital return for the 2016 
Comprehensive Capital Analysis and 
Review cycle to $12.2 billion. To put that 
figure in context, that’s nearly 10 times 
the $1.3 billion in capital we returned 
just two years ago. 
We returned this capital through a 
larger dividend and buybacks, which 
reduced the number of common shares 
outstanding by 181 million, or 6 percent, 
and increased our Tangible Book Value 
per share by 7 percent to $64.57.
Even after returning that capital, we 
ended the year with a Common Equity 
Tier 1 Ratio of 12.6 percent, 50 basis 
points higher than when we started

LETTER TO  
SHAREHOLDERS
Why? First, early last year, despite the 
volatility in the markets, we decided to 
push ahead with our plans to invest in 
Cards, Equities, Mexico, TTS, Citigold, 
and much-needed infrastructure and 
technology across the franchise. We 
also saw expected smaller gains on 
asset sales in Citi Holdings, which 
further reduced our top-line results. 
All that aside, we do have a clear path 
to producing those better returns 
you have every reason to expect and 
deserve. That path primarily relies on 
drivers that are within our control:
First, our raw earnings power, which 
consists of continuing to drive client 
engagement, continuing to grow 
wallet share, continuing to monetize 
the investments we’ve made in our 
franchise, and continuing to improve 
our efficiency through simplification, 
digitization and expense discipline. 
Second, our capital base optimization, 
which consists of continuing to wind 
down our non-core assets, continuing 
to utilize our Deferred Tax Assets (DTA) 
while reducing the amount of capital 
we need to support them, and seeking 
to return as much regulatory capital 
to shareholders as we possibly can 
above the amount needed to prudently 
operate and invest in our businesses. 
Third, our operating environment, 
including the expected upward 
trajectory of the Federal Funds Rate. 
We believe that strong execution 
against all three drivers will place our 
updated financial targets firmly within 
reach, including: a 10 percent ROTCE 
excluding our disallowed Deferred Tax 
Assets in 2018; and a 10 percent ROTCE 
including our DTA in 2019. Longer term, 
we believe Citi is capable of generating 
a 14% ROTCE.
While expectations for growth have 
gained conviction since the election 
of Donald J. Trump as U.S. president, 
some have questioned whether our 
globality is a vulnerability in the current 
political environment. To the contrary, 
we see it as an advantage. Trade policy 
and agreements may take different 
forms and reflect different priorities, 
but trade isn’t going away. And our 
network is uniquely situated to helping 
our clients — many of whom are U.S. 
and non-U.S. multinationals we serve 
in dozens of countries — navigate these 
changes, whether through supply chain 
optimization, our advisory capabilities 
or trade finance.

customers and clients, and the right 
people in the right places to meet our 
updated targets.
It’s also clear that to fulfill our promise

Statement of the 
Chairman  
of the Board of 
Management
Eighth consecutive sales record
Because customers around the world value our cars and motorcycles so much, the BMW Group 
was able to post record sales for the eighth consecutive year. The BMW Group has been number 
one in the global premium segment for the past 15 years. Our brands BMW, Rolls-Royce and 
BMW Motorrad achieved new all-time highs, while MINI reported its second-highest sales 
result ever. 
For the first time, BMW M GmbH broke through the 100,000 unit sales mark with its M and 
M Performance models.
Despite tough headwinds, second-best result in our history
Group earnings before tax and annual net profit were both the second-highest in our history. As 
previously announced, earnings before tax were moderately lower than last year’s record figure. 
With an EBIT margin of 7.2 percent in the Automotive segment, we exceeded our adjusted target. 
This figure only partially includes our China business, as is usual. The Group EBT margin of 
10.1 percent was above our 10 percent target for the eighth consecutive year. Once again, our 
financial services business made a significant contribution to the Group result.
Dear Shareholders, your company is on a very solid footing and possesses considerable financial 
strength. This means we can continue to invest in new technologies, services and our locations 
as our springboard to the future.
Systematic electrification for emissions-free driving
The future belongs to electric mobility – there is no doubt in my mind about that. But it’s certainly 
not a sprint, it’s a marathon. By late 2019, we aim to have half a million electrified BMW Group 
vehicles on the roads. 
The trend is clear: in Europe, no other manufacturer sells more electrified vehicles than the 
BMW Group. Between 2015 and 2018, sales of our electric models and plug-in hybrids increased 
more than fourfold. 
We are also number one worldwide in registrations of plug-in hybrid vehicles. This technology 
not only gives our customers access to electric driving, it is also a quick and pragmatic way to 
improve air quality in cities. Studies show that plug-in hybrids with an electric range of at least 
60 km are driven in electric mode just as often as pure-electric models.
And there’s more coming on the electric side: 2019 will bring plug-in hybrid variants of the 
new BMW 3 Series, X5 and 7 Series. The X3 will also be available for the first time with a hybrid 
drive train. These will be joined by the first fully electric MINI and, in 2020, by the first fully 
electric BMW – the iX3. 
By the end of 2020, we will have more than ten new and revised models with an electrified 
drive train. Thanks to flexible vehicle architectures, our plants will be able to build different 
drive types. 
The heart of an electric vehicle is the electric motor and the battery. We produce both the 
electric drive and the high-voltage battery in-house. In the summer, we will open the new 
BMW Group Battery Cell Competence Centre in Munich, where we will develop so-called 
build-to-print prototypes. For production of base cells, we will be working with the world’s 
largest manufacturer of automotive battery cells, CATL, from China, and with Northvolt in 
a European consortium.
",Harald Krüger,Chairman of the Board of Management,"BMW Group's China business is mentioned as a usual and partially included component of their Automotive segment's EBIT margin. For their electrification strategy, BMW announced a partnership with CATL, the 'world’s largest manufacturer of automotive battery cells,' from China, for the production of base cells.","Strategic engagement and reliance. BMW acknowledges China as an integral part of its automotive business and is forming crucial partnerships with Chinese companies (CATL) for critical components in its future electrification strategy, indicating a deep and strategic reliance on China's manufacturing capabilities.",Shareholder Letter

The Goldman Sachs Business Principles
We constantly strive to anticipate 
the rapidly changing needs of our 
clients and to develop new services 
to meet those needs.
We know that the world of fi nance will 
not stand still and that complacency 
can lead to extinction.
We regularly receive confi dential 
information as part of our normal 
client relationships.
To breach a confi dence or to use 
confi dential information improperly or 
carelessly would be unthinkable.
Our business is highly competitive, 
and we aggressively seek to expand 
our client relationships.
However, we must always be fair 
competitors and must never denigrate 
other fi rms.
Integrity and honesty are 
at the heart of our business.
We expect our people to maintain high 
ethical standards in everything they do, 
both in their work for the fi rm and in 
their personal lives.
Our clients’ interests 
always come fi rst.
Our experience shows that if we 
serve our clients well, our own 
success will follow.
Our assets are our people, 
capital and reputation.
If any of these is ever diminished, the 
last is the most diffi cult to restore. We 
are dedicated to complying fully with 
the letter and spirit of the laws, rules 
and ethical principles that govern us. 
Our continued success depends upon 
unswerving adherence to this standard.
Our goal is to provide superior 
returns to our shareholders.
Profi tability is critical to achieving 
superior returns, building our capital, 
and attracting and keeping our best 
people. Signifi cant employee stock 
ownership aligns the interests of our 
employees and our shareholders.
We take great pride in the 
professional quality of our work.
We have an uncompromising 
determination to achieve excellence 
in everything we undertake. Though 
we may be involved in a wide variety 
and heavy volume of activity, we 
would, if it came to a choice, rather 
be best than biggest.
We stress creativity and 
imagination in everything we do.
While recognizing that the old way may 
still be the best way, we constantly 
strive to fi nd a better solution to a 
client’s problems. We pride ourselves 
on having pioneered many of the 
practices and techniques that have 
become standard in the industry.
We make an unusual effort to 
identify and recruit the very best 
person for every job.
Although our activities are measured in 
billions of dollars, we select our people 
one by one. In a service business, 
we know that without the best people, 
we cannot be the best fi rm.
We offer our people the opportunity 
to move ahead more rapidly than is 
possible at most other places.
Advancement depends on merit and 
we have yet to fi nd the limits to the 
responsibility our best people are able 
to assume. For us to be successful, 
our men and women must refl ect the 
diversity of the communities and cultures 
in which we operate. That means 
we must attract, retain and motivate 
people from many backgrounds and 
perspectives. Being diverse is 
not optional; it is what we must be.
We stress teamwork 
in everything we do.
While individual creativity is always 
encouraged, we have found that team 
effort often produces the best results. 
We have no room for those who put their 
personal interests ahead of the interests 
of the fi rm and its clients.
The dedication of our people to 
the fi rm and the intense effort 
they give their jobs are greater 
than one fi nds in most other 
organizations.
We think that this is an important 
part of our success.
We consider our size an asset 
that we try hard to preserve.
We want to be big enough to undertake 
the largest project that any of our clients 
could contemplate, yet small enough to 
maintain the loyalty, the intimacy and the 
esprit de corps that we all treasure and 
that contribute greatly to our success.

Fellow Shareholders:
A s many of you know first hand, 2015 was a tale of two 
halves: the first half of the year featured a strong operating 
environment, but headwinds emerged, particularly during the 
second half, and these headwinds persisted into early 2016.
The first two quarters of 2015 were marked by heightened demand from our 
corporate clients for strategic advice and financings, strong client activity across 
our Equities franchise and growing demand from our Investment Management 
clients for our products and services. These factors culminated in record first-half 
results in Investment Banking and Investment Management, as well as the best 
first-half performance for Equities in six years.
As the year progressed, increasing concerns about China, 
the first rate hike from the U.S. Federal Reserve in nearly 
a decade, slowing global growth and falling commodity 
prices — especially in oil — began to emerge. We faced 
these headwinds, and lower client activity across many  
of our businesses suggested that our clients and peers  
also faced their share of challenges.
In addition to the impact of the operating environment, 
our 2015 financial performance was negatively affected 
by the resolution of our most significant outstanding legal 
exposure relating to our securitization, underwriting and 
sale of residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) 
from 2005 to 2007. In January 2016, we announced an 
agreement in principle with the RMBS Working Group,* 
under which we will pay a $2.39 billion civil monetary 
penalty, make $875 million in cash payments and provide 
$1.80 billion in consumer relief.
Despite these factors, our strong and diversified client 
franchise allowed us to produce relatively stable net 
revenues in 2015. The firm generated net revenues of 
$33.82 billion, marking our fourth consecutive year of 
roughly $34 billion in net revenues. Net earnings were 
$6.08 billion and diluted earnings per common share 
were $12.14. Return on average common shareholders’ 
equity (ROE) was 7.4 percent for 2015, which would 
have been 3.8 percentage points higher excluding the 
provisions we recorded during the year related to the 
RMBS Working Group settlement.
*  On January 14, 2016, the firm announced an agreement in principle, subject to the negotiation of definitive documentation, to resolve the ongoing investigation of the Residential Mortgage-Backed 
Securities Working Group of the U.S. Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force (RMBS Working Group). The agreement in principle will resolve actual and potential civil claims by the U.S. Department of 
Justice, the New York and Illinois Attorneys General, the National Credit Union Administration (as conservator for several failed credit unions) and the Federal Home Loan Banks of Chicago and Seattle, 
relating to the firm’s securitization, underwriting and sale of residential mortgage-backed securities from 2005 to 2007. For additional information, see the firm’s Form 8-K filed with the U.S. Securities 
and Exchange Commission on January 14, 2016.

Chief Operating Officer

In this year’s letter to our shareholders, we cover a  
wide array of topics, including an overview of our 
financial profile, a review of our strong and diverse  
client franchise, as well as our thoughts on the forward 
outlook, particularly how we are thinking about 
navigating these uncertain times.
Financial Profile
As we manage our financial profile, our strategy is 
predicated on carefully delineating between structural 
and cyclical factors affecting our businesses. Accordingly, 
in 2015, we continued to adjust our franchise to address 
structural changes in the regulatory environment, and  
we will continue to do so as needed. From a cyclical 
perspective, it certainly feels like the cycle has been 
prolonged, particularly as interest rates in many parts  
of the world remain at — or even below — zero, and 
growth and deflation concerns, among other worries, 
have persisted.
It is important to remember that cycles do turn, even if 
the timing of such inflections may be difficult to predict. 
As we look to deliver value to our shareholders over the 
long term, our focus continues to be on managing to 
both the structural and cyclical forces we see at play, 
while remaining flexible enough to capture future 
growth opportunities.
Our efforts in this regard have yielded solid results. Over 
the past four years, we have diversified our franchise 
while holding net revenues steady. We have increased our 
capital and liquidity, decreased our risk, and have stayed 
focused on efficiently and prudently managing our 
resources — all while helping our clients to execute their 
long-term goals and strategic objectives. Over the same 
four-year period, we returned approximately $25 billion 
in capital to our shareholders, increased dividends per 
common share by 44 percent and reduced our basic  
share count by 14 percent.
In response to structural changes resulting from new 
regulations, since the end of 2007, we have reduced  
our balance sheet by approximately one-quarter, while 
nearly doubling common shareholders’ equity — cutting 
gross leverage by more than 60 percent — and tripling 
our liquidity position to almost $200 billion. These 
measures have strengthened our long-term financial 
safety and soundness.
2 
Goldman Sachs 2015 Annual Report

--- Page 5 ---
Also as a result of structural changes, we have embraced 
opportunities to sell businesses and investments that were 
not core to our client franchise and were no longer the 
best use of shareholder capital relative to the returns.  
The loss in net revenues due to these sales has been offset 
by growth in our Investment Banking and Investment 
Management businesses. Last year, these two businesses 
accounted for 39 percent of our net revenues, compared 
to only 30 percent in 2012. Investment Banking was 
approximately one-half the size of Fixed Income, 
Currency and Commodities Client Execution (FICC) four 
years ago; today, our business mix is more balanced.
This does not mean we are moving away from FICC. 
Rather, we remain committed to meeting the needs of  
our clients, while managing to structural and cyclical 
headwinds. For example, we have reduced risk-weighted 
assets within FICC significantly over the past four years, 
largely in response to structural changes resulting from 
new regulations.
On the cost side, we have continued to find ways to 
improve our operating efficiency. Headcount across  
the firm is up 11 percent over the last four years, largely 
to meet regulatory compliance needs. However, through 
a combination of shifting to a greater percentage of 
junior employees and relocating some of our footprint  
to lower-cost locations, we have managed our  
expenses well.
More specifically, we have increased the number of 
analysts, associates and vice presidents at the firm by  
17 percent since the beginning of 2012, while our partner 
and managing director populations have decreased by 
two percent. Approximately 25 percent of our total staff 
is now in lower-cost locations such as Salt Lake City, 
Dallas, Irving, Warsaw, Singapore and Bengaluru. As  
a result, while total staff levels are up over the four-year 
period, overall compensation and benefits expenses  
have declined by approximately $270 million.
Looking ahead, we will continue to pursue ways to be 
more cost effective by assessing our expense structure 
while ensuring we meet the needs of our clients. Whether 
we are adjusting to structural or cyclical dynamics, we 
will carefully balance our expense management efforts 
against our ability to capture future market share and 
growth opportunities.
Investment Banking
Our leading Investment Banking franchise allowed us to 
capture significant market share in 2015. The business 
achieved its second-highest net revenues in 2015, driven 
by a strong environment for mergers and acquisitions 
(M&A). Industry-wide volumes for announced M&A 
transactions increased by more than 45 percent in 2015, 
while the firm’s volumes increased by approximately  
80 percent. We ended the year ranked first in global 
announced and completed M&A, with completed  
M&A volumes that were more than $350 billion higher 
than our next-closest competitor — a record gap since 
the firm went public.
By most measures, 2015 was a robust year for  
M&A. However, volumes as a percentage of market 
capitalization are still below prior-cycle peak levels.  
We see this as a sign that there is still some room to run 
for M&A activity, particularly when equity markets 
show signs of sustained stabilization. We also see 
consolidation opportunities in sectors such as industrials, 
energy, mining, food, media and telecommunications.
While total underwriting revenues declined in 2015,  
we performed relatively well in the context of softer 
equity and debt markets in the second half of the year. 
We finished 2015 ranked first in global equity and 
equity-related and common stock offerings. Similar to  
the dynamics we see in the M&A market, we believe 
there may be pent-up demand among our corporate 
clients to tap into public equity markets when conditions 
improve, particularly given that private financing 
conditions have generally tightened. A decline in debt 
underwriting net revenues in 2015 was largely due to  
a drop in leveraged finance activity.

Institutional Client Services
Investing & Lending
In the wake of balance sheet restructurings in the  
U.S. and elsewhere, we remain one of the few financial 
institutions with leading global franchises in both FICC 
and Equities. We view this as critical to the long-term 
success of our Institutional Client Services business.  
We expect our ability to offer our clients a broad suite  
of services to be a key competitive advantage in the 
years ahead.
Over the course of 2015, within FICC, lower levels  
of client activity in credit and mortgage products were 
partly offset by stronger client activity and a more 
favorable backdrop for macro products, particularly  
in interest rates and currencies.
Equities benefitted from a better market environment, 
posting solid results for the year. Clients continued to 
place significant value on the integration of our various 
services across Equities — electronic, cash, derivatives 
and prime brokerage — as well as our global footprint, 
all of which was reflected in our performance in 
these areas.
Moving forward, addressing structural changes in our 
Institutional Client Services businesses, such as risk- 
based capital rules, will remain a central focus for our 
management team. At the same time, we will look for 
ways to advance our franchise in the evolving landscape. 
Competitor retrenchments in the wake of structural 
developments should provide an opportunity for us to 
capture market share over the longer term.
As it pertains to cyclical trends in Institutional Client 
Services, we continue to carefully scale our business 
relative to the environment, but have also chosen to 
remain targeted in our efforts. Our business is highly 
correlated to economic growth, and when a better 
opportunity set eventually presents itself — and it  
will — our strong, deep and broad client franchise  
should position us well to respond.
Our Investing & Lending business enhances and expands 
our client relationships. It creates synergies for our 
broader client franchise because it enables us to extend 
credit or to invest alongside our clients. From a broader 
perspective, by participating in Investing & Lending in  
a disciplined manner, we engage in the capital allocation 
process, which allows corporates and individuals to put 
capital to work to generate broader economic growth.
Over the past several years, the composition of Investing 
& Lending has changed significantly. Since the beginning 
of 2012, we have seen lending increase threefold, 
primarily to private wealth management and corporate 
clients. Our corporate loan portfolio is well diversified, 
with no one sector representing more than one-quarter  
of the portfolio. Our private equity portfolio similarly 
reflects the diversity of our global client franchise, 
comprising more than 800 different investments globally 
across a broad spectrum of industries. In some cases, we 
invest in private companies alongside our clients. In other 
cases, we invest in public equity or in real estate, or we 
deploy capital to seed new funds.
While the nature of our investing may change over time 
due to regulatory changes, and net revenues can fluctuate 
from quarter to quarter based on price movements, we 
evaluate the performance of our Investing & Lending 
portfolio over many years. On that basis, these activities 
have been strong contributors to returns over the last 
four years.
Investment Management
Our Investment Management business is one of only  
a few such franchises globally that can meet the needs  
of a broad spectrum of clients across many products and 
regions. We serve investors of all types, including retirees 
in need of mutual funds, entrepreneurs who have sold 
their companies and pension fund managers who need 
help with asset allocation. With this in mind, we built 
4 
Goldman Sachs 2015 Annual Report

--- Page 7 ---
our business to be global, broad and deep, and to focus 
on delivering consistent returns over time. We believe 
that our emphasis on providing the best possible advice, 
products and services will help us outperform the 
industry over time.
Executing on this strategy, we have experienced 
significant growth in our business over the past several 
years. We ended 2015 with a record $1.25 trillion in 
assets under supervision, up from $895 billion at the 
start of 2012. This growth has been the direct result  
of robust net inflows, driven in part from market share 
gains, as clients place increasing value on asset managers 
like us that offer a broad array of products and services. 
In 2015, our $53 billion in organic, long-term net inflows 
outperformed our largest active management peers. 
In some areas of asset management, we are still small 
relative to the market leader. As we look ahead, this 
means we see opportunity to grow substantially — both 
by continuing to gain market share in our incumbent 
businesses and by expanding into new ones.
Our growth in assets under supervision has also come 
from new products and several strategic acquisitions.  
We have launched a handful of new products that  
have added more than $50 billion to our assets under 
supervision over the past four years. Our Active Beta, 
Unconstrained Fixed Income and Income Oriented 
Strategies funds, for example, offer our clients compelling 
new opportunities.
What’s more, eight acquisitions since the beginning  
of 2012 have driven more than $70 billion in inflows.  
These acquisitions have added important new capabilities, 
filled gaps in our asset management offering and added 
scale to our current business. For example, in 2015,  
we acquired Imprint Capital Advisors, a dedicated 
environmental, social and governance investment 
advisor, strengthening our ability to help our clients 
address these considerations in their portfolios.  
Looking to build upon these efforts, we will continue  
to evaluate targeted strategic acquisition opportunities  
as they arise.
Impact Investing
Our firm is committed to fostering meaningful change  
in the global economy, and in the communities in which 
we live and work, both through our core businesses, and 
by engaging in other activities that leverage our expertise 
to promote economic progress. This means, among other 
things, helping new enterprises succeed and grow by 
investing in entrepreneurs, and helping to finance 
different types of projects across the globe, such as those 
that can improve living standards within traditionally 
underserved communities. It also means being mindful  
of the environment’s importance, not only to society as  
a whole, but also to economic growth, and driving that 
core belief through our work with our clients and within 
the management of our own operations.
Urban Investment Group
We have a long history of innovative impact investing 
through our Urban Investment Group (UIG). Since  
2001, UIG has committed more than $4.9 billion to 
underserved U.S. communities, facilitating the creation 
and preservation of over 20,000 housing units — the 
majority of which are affordable for low- to middle- 
income families — as well as more than 1.9 million 
square feet of community space and over 6 million 
square feet of commercial, retail and industrial facilities. 
We work with local stakeholders from the nonprofit, 
for-profit and public sectors, focusing on community  
and economic development. We have also been a pioneer 
in the creation of “social impact bonds,” which are 
financial instruments that leverage private investments  
to support high-impact social programs. In fact, we  
were involved in four of the eight social impact bond 
financings that have been launched in the U.S.

Environmental Impact
We were among the first global financial institutions  
to acknowledge the scale and urgency of the challenges 
posed by climate change when we established our 
Environmental Policy Framework in 2005. A decade 
later, we have continued to build on our commitment  
to environmental stewardship, making it a part of our 
core mission to deploy financial solutions and drive 
market opportunities that help to address climate change. 
Specifically, to facilitate the transition to a low-carbon 
economy, last year we updated our Environmental Policy 
Framework to include an increased target of $150 billion 
in clean energy financings and investments by 2025, up 
from an earlier target of $40 billion. Finally, we continue 
to be mindful of our own operational impact on the 
environment, pledging to be carbon neutral from  
2015 onwards and to target 100 percent renewable 
power to meet our global electricity needs by 2020.
10,000 Women
Since its launch, this initiative has provided more  
than 10,000 women from across 56 countries — 
including Afghanistan, Egypt, Rwanda, Brazil, India  
and China — with business and management education, 
mentoring and networking, and access to capital. After 
completing the program, nearly 70 percent of surveyed 
graduates have increased their revenue, 60 percent have 
added new jobs and most have doubled the size of their 
workforces. What’s also encouraging is the “multiplier 
effect”: 90 percent of our graduates have “paid it 
forward” by mentoring and teaching business skills  
to other women in their communities.
In 2014, The Goldman Sachs Foundation and 
International Finance Corporation, a member of the 
World Bank Group, launched the first-ever global finance 
facility dedicated exclusively to women-owned small-  
and medium-sized enterprises. To date, the facility has 
made more than $400 million in commitments to banks 
in 14 countries, enabling women from Kenya to China  
to Laos to access capital and grow their businesses. In 
2015, President Obama announced a $100 million 
commitment by the Overseas Private Investment 
Corporation, demonstrating how the facility is catalyzing 
new investments from both the public and private sectors  
in women-owned enterprises globally.
10,000 Small Businesses
Designed to help small businesses grow and create jobs 
by providing entrepreneurs with a practical business 
education and access to capital, 10,000 Small Businesses 
has served more than 6,000 small business owners at  
30 sites across the U.S. and the U.K. This includes our 
commitment of more than $180 million to 28 capital 
partners that have lent over $120 million to date, 
resulting in more than 750 loans to small businesses.  
The program has maintained a 99 percent graduation 
rate, with more than 75 percent of surveyed participants 
increasing their revenues, and nearly 60 percent 
generating new jobs within 18 months of graduation.
Focus on Technology
Technology underpins everything we do. In fact, 
approximately one quarter of our total staff works in 
technology, which demonstrates just how critical it has 
become to our strategy in several ways.
First and foremost, technology enhances the overall 
experience and quality of service we are able to  
provide to our clients. It allows us to execute transactions 
more quickly and seamlessly, to provide better market 
analytics, data and other information, and to 
communicate faster and more efficiently.
Second, technology helps us to operate more efficiently  
as a firm. For example, relying more on open source and 
cloud strategies has helped us reduce vendor expenses  
for our workplace application infrastructure products 
and market data sources.
Third, technology helps us meet new regulatory 
requirements, such as Dodd-Frank implementation and 
Basel III provisions. We have hired more technology  
6 
Goldman Sachs 2015 Annual Report

--- Page 9 ---
staff to build and adapt software and to automate such 
processes, which would have otherwise been highly 
manual and substantially more time intensive. Once  
we have fully embedded technology solutions for our 
regulatory needs, we should be able to reduce or redirect 
resources to support other areas of our firm.
Finally, the technology we create or develop inside of 
Goldman Sachs can be a stand-alone product. We have  
a successful track record in this regard, with Tradeweb, 
DirectEdge and Markit as examples of platforms we 
developed or participated in creating, and then monetized. 
Today, new platforms such as Symphony and Marquee 
are helping our clients communicate, manage risk and 
better analyze their investments. Symphony is an 
independent company built around core technology 
developed and contributed by Goldman Sachs. For 
Marquee, we built a common application development 
platform, allowing our businesses to create sophisticated 
tools that deliver cutting-edge capabilities to our 
institutional investing clients.
Our People
In a rapidly evolving and highly competitive industry  
like ours, technology is clearly a critical differentiator.  
Yet the quality of our talent remains a vital competitive 
advantage for us — if not the vital competitive advantage 
we maintain.
Ours is a business of relationships. This is the case  
not only in our work with clients, but also here within 
the firm. To that end, Goldman Sachs goes to great 
lengths to employ the best people with a wide range  
of experience and backgrounds. In 2015, we extended  
offers to 4 percent of applicants for open positions,  
and more than 80 percent of those offered roles chose  
to join the firm.
As we compete for talent not only with other financial 
firms, but also across other industries, particularly in 
technology, we strive to remain a place where top talent 
aspires to work. We believe our time-tested culture of 
client service, teamwork and excellence sets us  
apart in this regard, and we find that people come  
to Goldman Sachs because the nature of our work is 
fundamentally consequential to the world around them. 
By helping to allocate capital, manage risk and provide 
products, services and advice to a broad array of clients, 
Goldman Sachs plays a vital role in the economy  
across industries and regions, something that is 
inherently appealing to people who want to affect 
positive outcomes.
With this in mind, we are proud that we were once  
again recognized as an employer of choice across  
a wide variety of metrics on Fortune magazine’s  
“100 Best Companies to Work For” and “Most  
Admired Companies.” We were also pleased to again  
be named as one of Working Mother magazine’s  
“100 Best Companies” and “Best Companies for 
Multicultural Women.”
Attracting and retaining the highest-caliber talent also 
means that we must invest in our people early on in  
their careers — the best of whom will become the next 
generation of leadership at the firm. Building off the 
learnings of our biennial People Survey, last year we 
unveiled a set of new initiatives designed to support 
junior employees, giving them more flexibility and 
greater exposure to our client franchise. In 2015, we  
also selected our newest class of managing directors.  
In addition to hailing from more than 40 countries,  
40 percent of the class of 2015 started at the firm as 
analysts, a testament to our emphasis on talent 
development and retention for the long haul.
Looking Ahead
As we look ahead, the question that is top of mind not 
only to our clients, but also to Goldman Sachs, is: how 
do we think about navigating these uncertain times?
Since the second half of 2015, concerns about global 
economic growth, investor sentiment, and regulatory  
and monetary policy — in tandem with other 
Goldman Sachs 2015 Annual Report 
7 
 

--- Page 10 ---
see room for continued fiscal policy expansion in  
some economies, and options for monetary policy if 
meaningful growth proves elusive.
We can’t forecast every outcome, and we expect the 
near-term environment to prove challenging. This is  
why we focus on issues such as tight cost controls, and 
consistently assess our own strategic areas of focus.  
Yet we find ourselves generally optimistic about the 
longer term. By staying true to our strategic focus, while 
adapting quickly to structural and cyclical factors, and 
maintaining our focus on meeting the needs of new and 
existing clients, we strive to continue to deliver on our 
long history of providing our shareholders with best- 
in-class returns.

macroeconomic and geopolitical dynamics — have  
made for pervasive uncertainty. Slowing growth in China, 
a presidential election in the U.S., a referendum in the 
U.K. about its future in the European Union, volatility  
in the markets and regions consumed by conflict, to name  
a few, are examples of issues that are naturally generating 
unease. Other fundamental questions being raised — 
from whether technology is permanently displacing jobs 
to whether monetary policy has reached its limits in 
affecting economic outcomes — have gone from esoteric 
to mainstream.
At Goldman Sachs, we grapple with these questions day 
in and day out. As managers of risk, we do our best to 
understand them, and to prepare our clients and our  
firm for even low-probability but highly consequential 
scenarios. This is why we worry about deflationary 
pressures, or liquidity problems in financial markets as  
a result of new regulations, or how China will manage  
its transition from an infrastructure-driven to a 
consumer-driven economy. It’s why we keep a close eye 
on emerging markets, particularly those that lack 
diversification and are heavily exposed to commodity 
exports, where a prolonged supply overhang could  
negatively affect prices for some time to come.
When our clients confront these or other challenges,  
we use our institutional resources to help them navigate 
the choppy waters, and we regularly consider how these 
scenarios and other tail-risk events could directly affect 
our firm.
While we must consistently try to “see around corners” 
to anticipate problems, we also see plenty of reasons  
for optimism. We see the U.S. nearing full employment,  
signs of modest inflation and some stabilization in equity  
and commodity markets. We don’t see how a world  
of zero or negative interest rates could possibly be the  
“new normal.” Moreover, we view China’s slower rate  
of economic growth as still substantial, particularly given 
that it is now the world’s second-largest economy. We

Letter to our Shareholders 
Growth that enhances value for years to come: that is the Volkswagen Group's objective. For our investors, for our 
customers, for our employees and for society as a whole.  
Amidst  a  demanding  environment,  we  delivered  robust  results  in  fiscal  year  2023.  We  increased  deliveries  to 
customers by 12% to 9.24 million vehicles, with all regions contributing to this growth. In China, the Group’s largest 
single  market,  we  expanded  by  1.6%  despite  a  very  challenging  market  environment.  At  the  same  time,  the 
Volkswagen Group successfully continued its transformation, delivering 771,100 all-electric vehicles, up 34.7% 
compared with the previous year. In Europe, we further consolidated our strong market position in this segment.  
Our  robust  financial  performance  reflects  our  customers'  satisfaction  in  our  products.  With  sales  revenue  of 
€322.3 billion,  an  operating  result  of  €22.6  billion  and  a  resulting  operating  return  on  sales  of  7%,  we  have 
demonstrated the resilience of our business model. These results were achieved despite substantial headwinds 
from the measurement of commodity derivatives, which had had a beneficial effect on the operating result in the 
previous year. Another successful outcome of our endeavors was that we generated convincing net cash flow in 
the  Automotive  Division  on  the  back  of  earnings  of  €10.7  billion.  What’s  more,  the  Automotive  Division’s  net 
liquidity of €40.3 billion at the end of 2023 puts us in a very solid position.    
The Volkswagen Group delivers. Again and again. And it does so reliably, even in a market environment charac-
terized by uncertainty. We are proud of our strong performance, and it is important to us that our shareholders also 
participate in this result. The Board of Management and Supervisory Board therefore propose a dividend of €9.00 
per ordinary share and €9.06 per preferred share.  
Our focus is on electrification. At the same time, we are seeing that the ramp-up of e-mobility in some regions, 
such as North America and Europe, is progressing at a slower rate than previously assumed. Other countries, such 
as China, continue to impress with the speed of their transformation. This is why the Volkswagen Group is pursuing 
powertrain  flexibility  and  financial  robustness.  Our  unique  portfolio  provides the  right  products  for  customers. 
While we are investing extensively in the ramp-up of e-mobility, we continue to offer highly competitive, efficient 
and attractive combustion-engine models. By including both these models and our hybrid and electric vehicles in 
our portfolio, we ensure maximum flexibility without losing sight of our goal – the transition to e-mobility is our 
priority.

To our Shareholders 
Letter to our Shareholders
The Top 10 program again guided the success of our operational and strategic actions in the past year. We set 
priorities,  and  in  doing  so  follow  a  clear  and  transparent  logic:  specific  milestones,  clear  responsibilities  and 
regular progress reviews. One of the key points of the program is to align our company with the capital market. 
The development of virtual equity stories for all Volkswagen Group brands was an important element in this pursuit. 
To  us,  investors  are  more than  an  important  source  of  impetus:  as  shareholders, they  are  part  of  our  company. 
Generating  added value  for them, together  with  all  other  stakeholders,  is  a  key  component  of  how  we  see  our 
corporate governance role. This was one of the motivations for the Group Board of Management to seek intensive 
dialog with the capital market; as part of personal discussions at investor conferences in the world’s most impor-
tant financial centers or at our Capital Markets Day held at the Hockenheimring in June 2023.  
2023 was a year of realignment and restructuring for the Volkswagen Group. In many areas, we made faster prog-
ress than originally planned and expected. A lot of streamlining has been completed, and we are forging ahead 
with other tasks. We are transforming ourselves. The ground has been prepared: we are turning from renovator to 
architect and builder all in one. We have a plan and a clear view of the strengths and potential of the Volkswagen 
Group. We know where we are heading. We know the way. Our focus is on implementation. We are moving ahead, 
step by step and day by day, making visible, measurable progress.  
The Group’s strength lies in the strength of its brands. No other company offers such a compelling, strong and 
unique product portfolio. We cater to our customers' wishes in all segments and across all vehicle categories. We 
set high standards for the quality and design of our vehicles. In the past, we did not always meet these standards 
– our own and those of our customers – to the fullest extent. Last year, we established ambitious quality and design 
programs across all brands, drawing on synergies and lessons learned from all players in the Volkswagen Group
team. Initial results have shown that we are on the right track. 2024 will be a record year for new models. The
launch of our first vehicles on the all-electric premium PPE platform, the Audi Q6 e-tron and the Porsche Macan,
is an important milestone. They mark the establishment of a new generation of powerful, attractive models.
We have lived up to our responsibility in the interest of generations, for generations. Our brands and our products 
must be viable for the future. To achieve this, we have to make a strong investment in the future. We have to be in 
a position to finance this goal, which is why we have agreed clear targets with all brands and launched effective 
performance programs. These programs are not just to make cost savings: they are a unique opportunity to shape 
things.  We  want  to  prepare  the  brands  for  future  success,  which  includes  new  sources  of  revenue.  It’s  about 
sustainably increasing our profitability.  
Living up to our responsibility also means that we think of sustainability holistically, mindful of the natural environ-
ment, people, society and value-creating entrepreneurship. We have launched ambitious, structured programs in 
the Volkswagen Group and in all the brands. Meeting the targets set in these programs is the personal respon-
sibility of the managers. An important element of our sustainability strategy is our commitment to decarbonization. 
Production is one of the key levers in this regard: by 2030, we aim to cut production-related CO2 emissions from 
passenger cars and light commercial vehicles by 50% compared with the base year 2018. The prestigious Science 
Based Targets initiative (SBTi) has confirmed that, by setting this target for the production phase (Scope 1 and 
Scope 2), our company will meet the requirements for contributing to limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. 
The target to reduce CO2 emissions during the use phase (Scope 3) by 30% has been confirmed by the SBTi as 
compliant with limiting global warming to 2 degrees Celsius. These confirmations are an incentive for us.

To our Shareholders 
Letter to our Shareholders
The Volkswagen Group team stands for a new leadership mindset. Together, we have committed ourselves to a 
clear stance: one of entrepreneurship and individual responsibility, a winning stance. Volkswagen – our joint enter-
prise. Those are our tasks. And it is for us to solve them.  
In 2023, we homed in on one of our key skills, technology leadership, which is an integral part of Volkswagen’s 
DNA. The customers of our strong and captivating brands benefit from an intelligent platform strategy. This is also 
the key to creating greater efficiency, using synergies and building economic resilience in challenging and fiercely 
competitive times. In this process, we think from the customer’s perspective and are able to offer attractive vehi-
cles with attractive solutions at an attractive price. With the realignment of our architectures, the establishment 
of  technology  profiles,  progress  in  implementing  the  battery  strategy  and  the  expansion  of  high-performance 
charging networks, we have already achieved important milestones. The realignment of our software activities 
also is a powerful lever in the revision of our technology strategy. We focus on our core competencies, and also 
collaborate with a strong network of high-performing partners.   
The Volkswagen  Group  thinks  global  and  acts  local.  We  want  to  remain  strong  in  Europe  and  China  and  take 
advantage of our growth opportunities in North America. We do so with products tailored to the various require-
ments  of  our  customers  in  different  regions.  Our  strategy  for the  largest  single  market  is  entitled “In  China  for 
China”, and our actions have reflected the meaning of these words. In Hefei, we established Volkswagen China 
Technology Company last year. Today, more than 2,000 technology experts are already working here on the future 
of Chinese automaking. We aim to cut the development time for new products and technology by around 30% 
compared to the status quo to be in line with “China speed”. We are also making our product substance in China 
more  Chinese.  Our  cooperations  with  strong  partners  such  as  XPeng,  Thundersoft  and  Horizon  Robotics  are 
helping to make this possible: we will continue to work on the development of vehicles that are fully aligned with 
the needs of Chinese customers. In the North America region, we have taken significant steps forward by making 
fundamental strategy decisions such as on increasingly localized production, the construction of a battery cell 
plant  in  Ontario,  Canada,  and  the  revival  and  electrification  of  the  traditional  Scout  brand.  Here  we  will  make 
increased use of product synergies to leverage our growth potential with local production. Beyond the markets in 
China, North America and Europe, we also apply regional strategies in the growth markets of South America and India. 
We established a new steering model in 2023, which signifies less head office and more entrepreneurial respon-
sibility and greater creative freedom for the brands and their decision makers. We pursue intelligent capital allo-
cation and set clear guidelines.  
Growth that  enhances  value  for years to  come,  with  our transformation,  ladies  and  gentlemen,  we  are  making 
systematic progress toward realizing this objective. Step by step. After a year of reorganizing and streamlining our 
structures and focusing on the fundamental alignment of the Volkswagen Group, we are heading into a year of 
stabilizing and shaping our business. The path is clear. We are working toward the vision of a sustainably profitable 
group. A group with the most attractive products, the best team and the clear promise: sustainable mobility for 
generations to come. 
Sincerely, 
Oliver Blume

",Oliver Blume,Chief Executive Officer,"Volkswagen highlights China as its 'largest single market,' where it achieved growth despite a challenging environment. The company notes China's rapid transformation in e-mobility and emphasizes its 'In China for China' strategy. This involves establishing Volkswagen China Technology Company in Hefei to cut product development time by 30% to match 'China speed,' making products more Chinese, and partnering with local companies like XPeng, Thundersoft, and Horizon Robotics to develop vehicles tailored to Chinese customer needs.","Optimistic growth through strategic adaptation and strong localization.

Core earnings per share for ﬁ scal year 2012 were $3.85, which 
is 1% below the prior-year level. The EPS beneﬁ ts from sales 
growth, cost savings and share repurchase this past year were 
more than offset by a combination of headwinds from higher raw 
material costs, geographic mix, a higher effective core tax rate 
and increased investments to support our accelerated portfolio 
expansion into developing markets.
Free cash ﬂ ow for the ﬁ scal year was $9.3 billion. Adjusted free 
cash ﬂ ow productivity was 90%, consistent with our target. During 
the ﬁ scal year, we returned $10 billion of cash to shareholders 
through $6 billion of dividends and $4 billion of share repurchase. 
We paid a dividend for the 122nd consecutive 
year, making P&G one of only nine publicly 
traded companies headquartered in the U.S. 
to have delivered uninterrupted dividends 
for 120 years or more. 
We also increased the dividend by 7%. This was the 56th 
consecutive year we have increased the dividend, one of only six 
companies to have done this.
Over the last 10 years, P&G has paid out $42 billion in dividends. 
Excluding $20 billion of share repurchase associated with the 
Gillette acquisition, we have repurchased $46 billion of stock. 
In total, through dividends and share repurchase, we have returned 
$88 billion of cash to our shareholders, which is 90% of reported 
net earnings. 
Returning capital to shareholders, through 
both dividends and share repurchase, 
remains a central pillar of our efforts to 
create superior shareholder value.
I’m proud of the extraordinary efforts P&G people have made to 
keep our Company growing through a very demanding economic 
period. We know, however, that we have not delivered sufﬁ cient 
growth to rank among the best performers in our industry. 
To do this, we must get back on a path toward our long-term 
annual objective of high single-digit to low double-digit EPS growth 
and total shareholder return in the top third of our competitive 
peer group.

Innovation that
Sets New Standards
TIDE PODS IS AN EXAMPLE OF P&G innovation 
that obsoletes existing products or creates entirely 
new product categories. The innovative, three-
chamber, pre-measured packet can simply be dropped 
in the wash — no measuring, no worrying — and it 
even dissolves in cold water.
Since launching in the U.S. in February 2012, Tide PODS 
has had a very strong performance — ahead of our 
expectations. Since we began shipping PODS, the unit 
dose laundry segment has more than doubled to 6% 
of total laundry share — and Tide PODS is over two-
thirds of this segment.
It’s an innovation that’s making laundry day easier — 
and is saving consumers loads of time.

To accelerate progress down this path and address our shortfalls, 
we have implemented three meaningful changes: strengthening 
our core business, renewing our focus on discontinuous innovation, 
and implementing a $10 billion productivity program.
Focusing on Our Core
The ﬁ rst change is our 40/20/10 focus — focusing resources on 
the 40 largest and most proﬁ table businesses, many of which are 
in developed markets; on our 20 largest innovations; and on the 
10 most important developing markets. 
Our 40 largest businesses generate more than 50% of sales and 
nearly 70% of operating proﬁ t. They are disproportionately in the 
U.S. and China, which are P&G’s ﬁ rst and second largest, most 
proﬁ table markets, respectively. 
Our 20 most important innovations are 
nearly 10 times larger on average than the 
rest of the initiatives. This is the core of 
our innovation pipeline. 
Our 10 most important developing markets are critical to P&G’s 
future growth. Between 2010 and 2020, the world’s population 
will grow by 700 million people, and 95% of this population 
growth will be in developing markets. During that same period, 
the world’s middle class will increase by 1.4 billion people, 98% 
in developing markets. Population growth and household income 
growth are the primary drivers of our business growth, so these 
trends are highly encouraging for P&G’s future. We are maintain-
ing strong momentum in developing markets, targeting the 10 
developing markets with the highest potential for growth.
We will innovate and execute with excellence across all our busi-
nesses, but this sharp focus on core businesses, our biggest 
innovations and developing markets will have the greatest impact 
on getting P&G back on track to leadership levels of growth and 
shareholder value.
Winning with Innovation
The second change we’ve made is a deliberate refocus 
on discontinuous innovation — innovation that obsoletes current 
products and creates new categories and new brands. Examples 
are products such as Tide PODS, Swiffer, and Crest Whitestrips.
We will maintain our commitment to ongoing innovation 
in our base business (i.e., the innovations that enable P&G’s brands 
to maintain superior performance and value between more

simultaneously. 
Earlier this year, we announced our objective of 
delivering $10 billion* in cost savings by the end 
of ﬁ scal year 2016. This program includes $6 billion 
of savings in cost of goods sold, $1 billion from 
marketing efﬁ ciencies, and $3 billion from non-
manufacturing overhead.

Time-Tested
Business Model
P&G’S LONG TRACK RECORD OF SUCCESS is 
based on a time-tested business model:
disruptive innovations), but some of our fastest periods of 
growth — and some of our largest and most proﬁ table present-
day businesses — were driven by discontinuous innovation: 
disposable diapers, liquid laundry detergents, home care 
items like Swiffer and Febreze. We need to get back to this 
level of innovation in a meaningful way. 
•  We discover meaningful 
insights into what consumers 
need and want.
•  We translate those insights into 
noticeably superior products.
•  We communicate product 
superiority through advertising 
that includes compelling claims, 
performance demonstrations 
and superior beneﬁ t visuals.
•  We price our products so that 
consumers experience superior 
overall value.
This drives leadership market shares, higher 
sales and lower costs, enabling us to reinvest
in our business. 
The model is simple and clear — and when 
we execute it consistently, we win.
We have an increasingly promising 
pipeline of category- and brand-creating 
innovations. It will take some time to 
get these innovations ready for launch, 
but I am conﬁ dent they will make a 
meaningful and sustainable difference 
as they enter the market. 
Improving Productivity
The third change is the $10 billion productivity program 
we announced in February. This is critical because 
productivity is the great enabler. It enables us to fund top-
line growth, to ensure our consumer value propositions are 
superior, to overcome macro headwinds, and to deliver 
better bottom-line growth.

since
1837
P&G has been 
innovating to improve 
consumers’ lives
Our productivity program includes $6 billion of savings in 
cost of goods sold, $3 billion from non-manufacturing 
overhead, and $1 billion from marketing efﬁ ciencies. We have 
already identiﬁ ed and staffed $1 billion of the $1.2 billion in 
cost-of-goods-sold savings that we need in ﬁ scal year 2013. 
We’re ahead of our targets to reduce non-manufacturing 
enrollment. In addition, manufacturing enrollment remained 
essentially ﬂ at, as signiﬁ cant productivity improvements 
offset the added stafﬁ ng required to operate several new 
manufacturing facilities which went into operation during 
the past year. And while we are continuing to increase 
marketing spending, we are also leveraging efﬁ ciencies that 
enable our brands to increase reach and improve effective-
ness — essentially doing more with less.
In addition to these three changes, we are improving execu-
tion in all parts of the Company. Better execution will help 
us to overcome macro challenges, manage competitive 
threats and get the maximum beneﬁ t from our innovation, 
marketing and productivity programs. 
We are also maintaining accountability — at all levels. On 
average across the Company, short-term bonus awards will 
be below target for the 2012 ﬁ scal year. Three-year perfor-
mance awards for senior executives are currently tracking, in 
aggregate, to less than 50% of target. We all acknowledge 
this reﬂ ects the level and quality of our results.
We have the right metrics to incent results that are aligned 
with shareholder objectives. Our long-term bonus metrics 
are simple: organic sales growth relative to competition, 
operating earnings growth, EPS growth and free cash ﬂ ow 
productivity — all of which drive total shareholder return.
We’ve aligned the entire Company next year on short-term 
metrics of volume and sales growth, market share, operating 
proﬁ t growth, productivity (which is delivering against the 
$10 billion plan), cash ﬂ ow and internal controls. These are 
the metrics that we will measure ourselves against and that 
you can measure our progress by. 
175 Years of Growth
P&G IS CELEBRATING A MILESTONE in 2012 
that very few companies have achieved: its 175th 
anniversary.

The Company was founded in Cincinnati in 1837 
by William Procter and James Gamble — a candle 
maker and a soap maker who started a small 
business that has grown into one of the world’s 
most admired companies and includes brands 
that have become household names, used and 
trusted by consumers every day in nearly every 
part of the world.
Today, P&G is the world’s largest and most 
proﬁ table consumer packaged goods company.

Committed to Shareholder 
Value Creation
THE WHOLE P&G ORGANIZATION is committed 
to shareholder value creation, and our objective is 
to consistently rank among the top third of our 
competitive peer group in Total Shareholder Return 
(TSR). Over the last 10 years, we have paid out 
$42 billion in dividends, and we have repurchased 
$46 billion* in stock. In total, we have returned 
$88 billion of cash to our shareholders, which is 
90% of reported net earnings. Cash yield to 
shareholders has averaged 5% over this period.
And over appropriately long periods of time — 
rolling 3-year, 5-year and 10-year periods — P&G has 
frequently outperformed the S&P 500 & Dow Jones 
Industrial Average since 1980.
This performance has made P&G an excellent 
long-term investment.

With these changes, we should be poised to seize meaningful 
opportunities for top- and bottom-line growth. We have signiﬁ cant 
opportunity for revenue growth through increased market share in 
our established businesses, by expanding our portfolio of superior 
branded products into the most promising markets and price tiers, 
and by innovating to expand product categories and create new 
ones. On the bottom line, our productivity opportunity is substan-
tive and the program is in place. This will help ﬁ nance top-line 
growth, ensure our consumer value propositions are superior, 
overcome macro headwinds and deliver better earnings growth.
We have taken decisive action, but this Company wasn’t built 
overnight. It will take some time to restart growth in developed 
markets and to get the savings program to full run-rate levels. 
It will take some investment to restart innovation where it has 
been lacking, to ensure our brands are priced appropriately, 
and to ensure that our marketing plans are sufﬁ cient to generate 
consumer awareness, trial and loyalty. We are committed to 
make those investments, fueled by improvements in productivity 
and costs.
We are moving forward with urgency, but with balance — balancing 
developing- and developed-market growth, balancing the top and 
bottom lines, and balancing short- and long-term returns.
I am conﬁ dent we will deliver. 
175 Years of Growth
In its 175-year history, P&G has weathered economic downturns 
and crises, wars and unprecedented change in virtually every 
aspect of our business. We’ve gone through some rough patches, 
but we have stayed focused on the fundamentals of our business, 
learned from our mistakes, and preserved the core of our Company 
while being willing to change everything else necessary to win 
with consumers and retail customers.
We’ve been able to do this so consistently over time because of the 
quality of P&G people. They are P&G’s most important competitive 
advantage. Along with our time-tested business model, we have 
a successful and equally tested model of hiring the best people and 
building them into the best leaders in our industry. The character 
and caliber of P&G people remain my greatest sources of conﬁ dence 
in our Company’s future.

Letter to our shareholders
Dear fellow shareholder,
The year in review has seen significant changes in our 
business environment, both at home in Switzerland and 
in many other countries where your company is active. 
Switzerland has seen changes in corporate law that 
directly impact your company. Challenges in the Middle 
East, Asia, Africa and Latin America have contributed to a 
general slowdown in the emerging markets’ growth rates. 
The developed markets, meanwhile, have continued to 
experience anaemic growth, at best. The results that we 
have achieved in this environment, therefore, are a tribute to 
our 333 000 employees, many of whom have experienced 
these difficult challenges first hand.
Sales were CHF 92.2 billion, with organic growth of 
4.6%, incorporating real internal growth of 3.1% and pricing 
of 1.5%. After some years of inflation, raw material costs 
were subdued in 2013, and our commitment to delivering 
the right value propositions to our consumers resulted 
in a low level of pricing: our relatively strong real internal 
growth, considering the environment, suggests that we 
succeeded against market. The trading operating profit 
was CHF 14.0 billion and the margin increased by 20 basis 
points to 15.2%. This performance was achieved whilst at 
the same time increasing our brand support. The net profit 
was CHF 10.0 billion and earnings per share were CHF 3.14. 
Underlying earnings per share were up 11.0% in constant 
currencies. Operating cash flow was CHF 15.0 billion. In 
view of this performance and the company’s strong financial 
position, the board is recommending a dividend per share of 
CHF 2.15, up 4.9% from CHF 2.05 last year.
The results in 2013 showed our determination to grow 
your company profitably and sustainably, allowing us to 
deliver over time the Nestlé Model of organic growth of 
5–6% together with improvements in our trading operating 
profit margin and earnings per share in constant currencies 
and in our capital efficiency. Indeed, our average organic 
growth has been 6.1% over the last ten years, during which 
time we also consistently improved our operating profit 
margin. This performance reflects a focus both on our 
shorter-term performance – seeking to grow faster than 
our markets – and on the longer-term – making the right 
decisions to ensure sustainable profitable growth into  
the future. 
2
Each year is a challenge in its own way, and 2013 was 
no different. A more difficult trading environment required 
an intense focus on ensuring we maintained our edge in 
the market. In 2013, guided by our strategic roadmap, we 
considered how we could work smarter to deliver greater 
value for consumers and for you, our fellow shareholders. 
We wanted to ensure we were agile enough to maximise 
the opportunities presented by today’s fast-changing 
environment.
The roadmap has aligned our people, wherever they are 
in the world, whatever activity they work in, behind a set of 
firm priorities which help us deliver our promise to be the 
leader in Nutrition, Health and Wellness.
The intrinsic value of our nutrition agenda will increase 
as populations expand, healthcare challenges increase and 
related costs multiply. Our leadership brings responsibility, 
including to be at the cutting edge of science and to use our 
know-how to contribute to solutions on problems ranging 
from malnutrition to obesity. It also means taking business 
risks by pioneering new opportunities, knowing that some 
may not work. Equally, it means being sufficiently present in 
consumers’ lives to be able to make a difference.
We also need to make the right choices. For example, 
whilst we see an exciting future role for personalised 
nutrition in managing chronic illness, we decided that our 
personalised weight management business, Jenny Craig, 
would be better served by different ownership and have 
divested it. Making the right choices enables us to put our 
best people and resources behind our best opportunities. 
We can focus investment more precisely, move faster and 
be more agile and responsive, all of which are critical to 
winning in today’s more complex, more competitive world. 
We will be able to be faster and more responsive by 
moving from managing complexity to mastering it. By 
doing so, we will be able to leverage our size to create 
further scale benefits and increased competitive advantage. 
One advantage that scale gives us is the ability to keep 
one eye on the longer-term, even as we navigate through 
shorter-term challenges. That means continuing to invest 
aggressively in capacities, capabilities, in R&D and our 
brands. In fact, 2013 saw investment in all these areas 
at levels that are among the highest in our history and in 
the industry. The opportunity for us now is to exploit that

Letter to our shareholders
investment: to do more with what we have; to further 
leverage our assets, our scale and our capabilities by 
working smarter. This will result in lower capital investment 
and a further reduction in structural costs. The benefits will 
be evident already in 2014, with a significant decrease in 
capital investment, compared to 2013.
The Board’s priorities included reviews of our global 
business portfolio in the context of our Nutrition, Health and 
Wellness strategy, of our past capital investments and our 
future needs, and of gender balance and diversity at Nestlé. 
Additionally, the Board of Directors spent considerable time 
analyzing and discussing the long-term strategic direction 
of your company and elaborated an enlarged vision of its 
strategy for the future. Our long-term strategic direction 
is to be the leader in Nutrition, Health and Wellness. We 
expanded the boundaries of nutrition with the creation of 
Nestlé Health Science in 2011. We are now expanding the 
foundation of health and wellness, with our announcement 
on 11th February 2014 of the acquisition of the 50% of 
Galderma that we did not already own, into the field of 
specialised medical skin treatments by setting up Nestlé 
Skin Health S.A.
 The biggest priority, however, was to understand what 
the significant changes in the Swiss legislative framework 
for corporates would mean for your company, including the 
so-called Minder Initiative, voted into law in March 2013. The 
Board’s aim was to keep your company as competitive as 
possible. Here are a few of the changes:
Each member of the Board of Directors will be re-elected 
on an annual basis. Previously, the Board had a staggered 
election process over three years, which provided a certain 
degree of stability. The yearly direct election of the Members 
of the Compensation Committee and the transfer of 
compensation approvals to the Annual General Meeting 
(AGM) also changes the dynamic between the Board and 
our shareholders. 
The Chairman will now be elected annually by 
shareholders, no longer appointed by the Board. The 
Chairman will therefore have to dedicate more time to 
shareholder relations and to shorter-term issues, in addition 
to devoting his energies to the longer-term strategy and 
priorities, and to ensuring the sustainability of the business, 
as his role demands. 
4
One of the tenets of the Minder Initiative was that it 
would empower shareholders. While about one-third of our 
shareholders are Swiss, about two-thirds are international, 
including European, American and Asian pension funds, 
investment trusts and sovereign wealth funds. We 
encourage all of them to vote at our AGM: a well-run 
company has shareholders who choose to be owners for 
the long term because they support the management and 
its strategy. Those shareholders will usually vote in support 
of the Board. It is probable, however, that shareholders will 
increasingly manage their additional voting responsibilities 
by delegating their voting decisions to international proxy 
advisors. 
Together with the invitation to the Annual General 
Meeting you will find a Report of the Board explaining the 
revision of our Articles of Association. This aims to meet 
both the requirements of the unique new Swiss law and of 
international best corporate governance and compensation 
practices.
The new governance framework will have a significant 
impact on our AGM. There will be more proposals to be 
voted on. Compliance with the new law will be at the 
forefront of the meeting since non-compliance can result in 
severe criminal punishment, which is unique in the world. 
The role of the Board, the corporate body with fiduciary 
responsibility for your company’s long-term development, 
has been weakened. The AGM has been given increased 
power. We therefore encourage all of you to vote, and 
so exercise your increased authority and assume your 
increased responsibility. By doing so, you will help preserve 
our tradition of being long-term focused and you will help 
us deliver our Creating Shared Value goals, which you 
previously enshrined in our Articles of Association and 
which have served us so well for almost 150 years.
There were changes to the Executive Board in 2013. 
Werner Bauer, Chief Technology Officer retired and was 
replaced by Stefan Catsicas. John Harris also retired 
and was replaced as head of Nestlé Waters by Marco 
Settembri. Martial Rolland took over responsibility for Nestlé 
Professional from Marc Caira who decided to take early 
retirement. The Board thanks Werner, John and Marc for the 

--- Page 9 ---
contributions over the many years they were with Nestlé. 
Peter Vogt became Head of Human Resources, following 
Jean-Marc Duvoisin’s move to Nestlé Nespresso.
A company’s actions should be consequent to its beliefs. 
We believe that our ability to win is due in no small part to 
our people, whom we consider a competitive advantage. 
People are the oxygen of an organisation, providing its 
creativity, dynamism and drive, and they become part of its 
culture and spirit as they are trained, progress, mentor and 
finally lead others. We have launched an initiative in Europe, 
pledging to create 20 000 positions for young people by 
2016, and we are encouraging our 60 000 suppliers to join 
us. This is just one example of the role of Nestlé in Society 
to create shared value by ensuring that our activities, 
investments and know-how benefit not just Nestlé but 
also our stakeholders and the communities where we are 
present. It is fundamental that a company such as Nestlé 
plays a positive role in society. Indeed, we believe we will 
create long-term value for our shareholders only if we 
respect and connect positively with society at large. This 
is what we call ‘Creating Shared Value’. Nestlé in Society is 
discussed in the accompanying reports, and we have also 
highlighted the increasing external recognition that we are 
receiving in this area.
Last year was challenging and 2014 will likely be the 
same. We will continue to be disciplined in driving our 
performance in line with the Nestlé Model of profitable 
growth and resource efficiency. We therefore expect our 
2014 performance to be similar to last year and again 
weighted to the second half, outperforming the market, 
with growth around 5% and improvements in margins, 
underlying earnings per share in constant currencies and 
capital efficiency.
As we said, our people are our strength and competitive 
advantage, and we would like to thank everyone at Nestlé for 
their great efforts in contributing to another year of progress 
for the Group. Wherever you are in the world, whatever 
challenges you have been facing, your commitment has 
been unwavering. 
On behalf of our Board of Directors we would finally like 
to thank our shareholders for their loyalty to our Company. 
We hope to count on your continued support.

Corporate Governance 
and Compliance
Board of Directors of Nestlé S.A.
at 31 December 2013
Corporate Governance
We engage with society on the basis of strong principles of 
governance and compliance that provide the framework  
of how we do business. The Chairman and the CEO ensure 
the tone of good governance at Board level and below. 
The Board regularly solicits input from investors, proxy 
advisors and other stakeholders, and reviews its governance 
on the basis of new legal requirements and best practices. 
As Nestlé has a highly diversified ownership structure, 
our dialogue with investors includes shareholder surveys, 
investor roundtables, analyst and engagement calls and 
bilateral meetings, pursing a holistic approach that manages 
both their financial and governance expectations.
Good governance helps us maintain trust with our 
employees, investors, governments, NGOs, our customers, 
consumers and other stakeholders. Without good 
governance and compliance we cannot reach our goal of 
doing business sustainably and in a way that creates shared 
value for society.
In our Nestlé in Society report we demonstrate how we 
engage with society at large.
Paul Bulcke
Our Annual Report includes our financial and nonfinancial 
commitments on governance, environmental, social, ethical 
and sustainability in line with the UN Global Compact 
Principles for Responsible Investment and the Global 
Reporting Initiative.

Corporate Governance and Compliance
Our Corporate Governance Report describes how our 
governance ensures the effectiveness of our Board. 
Our Compensation Report explains our compensation 
system and is submitted annually to a separate advisory vote 
of our shareholders.
We are actively engaged in the development of Swiss law 
and governance practices. In 2013, focus was on preparing 
for the implementation of new Swiss governance legislation 
going into effect next year. Nestlé aims to be an early 
adopter of various new governance practices demonstrating 
our commitment to be at the forefront of good governance 
in Switzerland. We expect to submit a pertinent revision of 
our Articles of Association to our upcoming Annual General 
Meeting. 
We will maintain our commitment in our Articles of 
Association to aim for long-term, sustainable value creation. 
Compliance
Compliance forms the basis of how we do business and 
is the foundation on which we engage with society. 
Compliance at Nestlé refers to our own commitments in 
Nestlé policies across all our Corporate Business Principles  
as well as all applicable laws.
While responsibility for compliance is assigned to the 
markets as per our Custodian Concept, a dedicated corporate 
Compliance function and a cross-functional Compliance 
Committee define the framework, facilitate the coordination 
between the relevant support functions and provide guidance 
and best practices in a holistic approach to Governance,  
Risk and Compliance (GRC). Market Compliance Committees  
ensure a consistent approach and help identify local 
compliance priorities.  
The right commitment and tone at the top foster a strong, 
principles-based compliance culture. Our Corporate Business 
Principles, our Management and Leadership Principles, our 
Code of Business Conduct and our Supplier Code are the 
foundations of our cross-functional Corporate Compliance 
Programme. Awareness campaigns including our ‘We 
make Nestlé campaign’ and regular risk assessments help 
us in their continuous implementation. In our performance 
evaluations, compliance is linked to ‘how’ goals were 
accomplished.
In 2013, we re-emphasized compliance with our Code of 
Business Conduct with our e-learning tool on integrity and a 
revised anti-bribery e-learning tool supporting the Markets’ 
training efforts. Our anti-trust and fair competition training 
was stepped up with an upgraded e-learning tool and 
physical training. We re-emphasized our integrated approach 
to GRC.
Compliance is regularly monitored by our corporate 
functions, internal and external audit, as well as through our 
CARE audit programme relying on independent external 
auditors. The CARE programme was extended to include 
pillars on human rights, labour practices and security. 
150 audits were conducted in 2013 and gaps were addressed.
Our integrity reporting system went live globally to deal 
with compliance related grievances, complementing the 
‘whistleblower procedure’ foreseen in our Code of Business 
Conduct, and our dedicated Ombudsman system to deal with 
grievances related to the World Health Organization Code of 
Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes. 620 messages were 
received by the end of September 2013 and all complaints 
were investigated.
We foster a common understanding of compliance across 
the functions and help markets identify local compliance 
priorities based on seven elements, including the verification 
of appropriate principles and policies, adequate internal 
controls, effective structures, monitoring and reporting, 
consequence management and above all the right culture and 
top level commitment. 
Conditions of work and employment, our responsible 
sourcing audit programme, legal compliance in particular 
with food and consumer law, financial regulatory compliance, 
data management and fraud prevention were other focus 
areas. 
Our WHO Code Compliance programme covers all Nestlé 
operations involved in the marketing of infant nutrition 
products. We adhere to the decisions of all governments 
regarding the application of the WHO Code in their countries 
and voluntarily apply the WHO Code in all developing 
countries. A special focus was on working with Wyeth 
Nutrition to align our policy and management systems in 
all higher-risk countries and on the areas identified through 
the FTSE4Good verification process. Our inclusion in the 
FTSE4Good index is a testimony to our commitment.

Letter to our shareholders
Henri Nestlé had a vision of a better world thanks to nutrition, an idea which is still 
pertinent today. Through innovation we can help people to live healthy and fulfilling 
lives. Innovation is our heritage, the foundation on which our brands are built, 
but also a key enabler of future success. The strength and depth of our Research 
and Development differentiates us from the competition, and helps us respond 
to the major changes we see in society. We are constantly acquiring a deeper 
understanding of nutritional science, and developing products and services with the 
potential to help people to live healthier lives and to address rising healthcare costs 
globally. One good example is our research collaboration with Samsung, which will 
explore the potential of nutrition science and digital sensor technology to provide 
new insights into healthy living. We continue to further extend the boundaries of 
our Nutrition, Health and Wellness strategy with Nestlé Health Science and Nestlé 
Skin Health. With their innovative pipelines of products designed to make a major 
contribution to the health needs of large parts of the population, they offer the 
promise of further growth and value creation.
We are well aware of how fundamentally digital is transforming society and 
for some time now we have been building the knowhow and talent to respond 
effectively and efficiently. Digital is changing not just how companies operate but 
also our relationships with partners, suppliers and the people who buy our products. 
It requires attention and investment to enable us to seize opportunities. Among 
others, we have enlarged our ‘Silicon Valley Innovation Outpost’ in San Francisco 
with staff drawn from the company’s marketing and technology functions. During 
the year, we launched the Henri@Nestlé open innovation platform, enabling start-up 
entrepreneurs to work with Nestlé as collaborative partners on projects that matter 
both to the company and to the millions of people who buy our products. We are 
creating a digital-first culture. This bold ambition will shape the next 150 years of the 
company’s progress.
We have always balanced investing for the long-term with delivering against our 
current financial commitments to drive growth in today’s challenging trading 
environment. We have increased investment behind our brands and sustained it.
Our long-term commitment to operational excellence delivers savings that benefit 
both growth and margins. During the year, we committed to further structural 
savings beyond those delivered annually by our continuous improvement initiative 
Nestlé Continuous Excellence. Leveraging our size and scale offers further 
opportunities to maximise efficiency. Nestlé Business Excellence is driving efforts 
to simplify, standardise and share support functions, and as such to leverage our 
scale. Here too digital contributes: delivering new capacity or routes-to-market 
4

--- Page 9 ---
without the need to construct ‘bricks and mortar’ infrastructure, or new possibilities 
to concentrate investment on projects that create more value. We continue to adapt 
our structure and organisation, finding the right balance between local focus and 
global scale to ensure we are best placed to exploit the fast-changing environment.
The Board of Directors took steps to ensure Nestlé’s continuing success after the 
transition necessitated by our changing roles. Peter Brabeck-Letmathe steps down 
in April having reached the mandatory age of retirement after 12 years as Chairman 
and before that 11 years as Chief Executive Officer. Paul Bulcke resigned as Chief 
Executive Officer at the end of 2016 after more than 8 years in the role, after the 
Board put him forward for election as Chairman of Nestlé at the upcoming Annual 
General Meeting. The Board appointed Ulf Mark Schneider to succeed him as Chief 
Executive Officer, a role he took up on January 1st 2017. Mr. Schneider was formerly 
Chief Executive Officer of the Fresenius Group, a company that offers products and 
services for dialysis, hospitals and outpatient treatments. This concludes a process 
that the Board began more than two years ago to appoint a strong leadership team 
to deliver the company’s short-term and long-term performance goals.
In September, it was announced that Luis Cantarell, Executive Vice President 
and Head of Zone EMENA, would retire at the end of the year after a long and 
distinguished career with the Group. Luis was one of the architects of the company’s 
Nutrition, Health and Wellness strategy and his contribution to its success cannot 
be overstated. The Board of Directors appointed Marco Settembri, Executive Vice 
President and Head of Nestlé Waters, to succeed him. Maurizio Patarnello, Market 
Head of Nestlé Russia and the Eurasia region, was appointed Deputy Executive Vice 
President and Head of Nestlé Waters. The Board also decided to change the business 
structure for Nestlé Professional from a globally managed business to a regionally 
managed business supported by a Nestlé Professional Strategic Business Unit from 
January 1st 2017. As a result of these changes, the Head of Nestlé Professional, 
Martial Rolland, left the Executive Board to become Market Head in the Russia and 
Eurasia region. We would like to thank Luis and all of those who retired in 2016 for 
their contribution to Nestlé’s success over the years and extend our best wishes to 
them as they begin this next chapter of their lives.
During the year, in addition to the succession planning, the Board reviewed the 
Nespresso business, Nestlé Nutrition and Nestlé Health Science. It examined our 
talent development strategy and appraised the company’s portfolio management 
and the performance of the acquisitions of recent years. The Board also reviewed 
how we track the external image of the company and travelled to China in order to 
better understand the dynamics of our second largest market.

Letter to our shareholders
In 2016, Nestlé partnered with R&R, a leading ice cream company based in the 
UK, to create Froneri, a new ice cream, frozen food and chilled dairy business in 
22 countries across the globe. Building on each company’s achievements, Froneri 
brings together decades of business and manufacturing expertise to create a new 
global player in the ice cream industry.
In this fast-changing world it is more important than ever that Nestlé is consistent, 
reliable and respected, in order to build trust. The consistency of our purpose: 
enhancing quality of life and contributing to a healthier future, has led us to act 
throughout our history as a responsible member of society. We strongly believe that  
the private sector is more than just an engine for economic growth and job creation. 
We are part of the fabric of society with its challenges and opportunities. As a global 
company we can make a substantial, positive impact in society, and inspire and work 
with others to achieve even more. Creating Shared Value describes what this means 
in practice; creating value for our shareholders with projects or business opportunities 
that at the same time benefit the communities in which we operate, and furthermore, 
society as a whole. This Creating Shared Value approach to doing business was started 
at Nestlé ten years ago. We are heartened to see others in our industry and beyond 
embracing the concept of shared value today.
A good example of our determination to make a difference is the Nestlé Global  
Youth Initiative which we started in Europe three years ago. During 2016, we 
pledged to offer to under-30 year olds thousands of jobs, apprenticeships and 
traineeships in each of our three geographical Zones over the coming years, on 
top of those already created. We believe that through these efforts to promote 
readiness-to-work we can make a significant contribution towards addressing the 
social cost of youth unemployment. Through the ‘Alliance for YOUth’, which Nestlé 
founded, we are creating an even bigger impact, working with more than two 
hundred partner companies to provide training and jobs.
Each day we touch billions of lives worldwide, from the individuals and families who 
enjoy our products, to the communities where we live and work, and the natural 
environment upon which we all depend. Our 42 public commitments provide the 
framework for our efforts in these areas, and our progress towards meeting them is 
detailed in the Nestlé in society report published alongside this Annual Review. They 
are fully aligned with the United Nations’ 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG’s) 
which set out a vision for ending poverty, hunger and inequality, and protecting the 
earth’s natural resources. The SDG’s help to guide our actions around a common 
agenda: an agenda to create a better world that we fully endorse and actively 
contribute to.
6

--- Page 11 ---
For 150 years we have adhered to a set of values rooted in respect: respect for 
ourselves, for others, for diversity and for the future. All of us at Nestlé live these 
values with passion, determination and discipline. They have withstood the test of 
time. They are integral to our success. It is our respect for future generations that 
compels us to act with responsibility and courage, even when times are difficult. 
So while we continue to take care of the short term, we are building and investing 
for the long term. We are well aware of the intensely competitive context in which 
we are operating today and are taking the steps necessary to further develop and 
strengthen your company. We are investing in the capabilities we need, the know-
how and the talent to continue to create value for you, our shareholders. This is the 
approach which we have followed successfully for 150 years. 
We would like to thank our 328 000 employees for their commitment to Nestlé. It 
is their hard work, alignment behind our strategy and dedication that enables us 
to deliver on our promises. We also want to thank you, our shareholders, for your 
continuing support, your confidence and above all for your trust. Rest assured 
that our passion for nutrition, health and wellness, and our passion for quality will 
continue to generate the sustainable, profitable returns you rightfully expect from us.

Enhancing quality of life

The strategy
Nutrition plays a profound  
role in everyone’s life. Our 
strategy focuses on delivering 
distinct benefits to people 
through the food and beverages, 
products and services we 
provide. Over 150 years we have 
built a successful business by 
understanding and anticipating 
the needs of society, and 
continuously adapting ourselves 
to seize the opportunities 
presented to us.
The fast-evolving needs and expectations 
of society today reconfirm the validity of our 
Nutrition, Health and Wellness strategy. The 
world is at an inflection point. The speed, 
intensity and the breadth of change is 
unprecedented. Digital disruption is reshaping 
our industry, our relationships with our suppliers 
and retailers, and with the people who buy our 
brands. Advances in science and technology  
are opening up new opportunities for us to  
play a role in addressing the challenges society 
faces. In a world where hundreds of millions 
of people are under-nourished, malnourished 
or over-weight we are well positioned to help 
contribute solutions.
Through our brands, our products and the 
services we offer, we are helping and inspiring 
people to live healthier lives. We are building, 
sharing and applying nutrition knowledge, 
and empowering people to make informed 
decisions about what they eat and what they 
feed their families. Our Start Healthy Stay Healthy 
programme helps parents and caregivers 
provide their children with the best start in life. In 
partnership with other stakeholders, our United 
for Healthier Kids programme helps establish 
healthier eating, drinking and lifestyle habits, and

nutrition and encouraging physical activity.
do that efficiently, effectively and responsibly. It 
drives internal alignment behind our goals.
We want our products to be the healthiest and 
It is more important than ever to ensure that 
the tastiest choices in each and every category 
we compete in. We use quality ingredients 
people know and trust, adding nutrients where 
appropriate. We are substantially reducing sugar, 
saturated fat and salt. By communicating clearly 
about the contribution each product makes 
to a healthy diet, we are helping people make 
informed decisions about what to eat and drink.
Our new nutrition and health platforms, Nestlé 
Health Science and Nestlé Skin Health, allow us 
to apply the knowledge we have developed with 
the most advanced Research and Development 
network in the industry. They enable us to 
develop products and services that meet specific 
needs of different parts of the population, to help 
address issues the world faces, for example rising 
healthcare costs.
By keeping ourselves relevant in this fast-
changing world, we can deliver industry-leading 
growth. We work with agility, creativity and 
discipline, constantly innovating and renovating 
our portfolio. Our Research and Development 
capability ensures we maintain our leading 
positions in the categories we compete in, 
driving growth throughout the portfolio. The 
innovation is broad-based across all categories, 
brands and markets. It comes in many forms – 
from blockbusters like Nespresso, to renovating 
products to keep them fresh and relevant as we 
have done with brands like Nescafé and Nescafé 
Dolce Gusto, Nido, Milo and Maggi.
Digital innovation is a strong competitive 
advantage and a cornerstone of the company’s 
future development. For some time now we 
have been creating a digital-first culture that 
enables us to manage and to benefit from the 
disruption digital is bringing. As the ‘fourth 
industrial revolution’ takes hold, we are confident 
that we can capitalise on the efficiencies and the 
opportunities digital brings.
The Nestlé Strategic Roadmap guides us in 
these turbulent times. The glue is our purpose 
and values, and our culture. The roadmap says 
what we want to be as a company, what we want 
to leverage as competitive advantages to fuel 
growth, where we want to grow and how we will 
12
resources are dedicated to the right projects, 
maximising the effectiveness of what we spend. 
We have a strong cost control culture. Through 
Nestlé Continuous Excellence we continuously 
improve our operations and deliver savings. 
With Nestlé Business Excellence we simplify, 
standardise and share. This is creating back-
office efficiencies, helping us to leverage our 
size and scale to deliver competitive advantage, 
and unlocking resources. These are the fuel 
for growth, brand support, Research and 
Development, innovation and renovation.
We challenge ourselves continuously to look 
for new opportunities and for areas where we can 
make a contribution to the issues society faces. 
This creates shared value for the communities 
where we operate and for our shareholders. We 
are contributing to society while growing our 
business. Trust is fundamental to our success. 
Trust helps deliver growth, creating shared value 
for our shareholders and for society. Quality 
and compliance underpin that trust, and are the 
best way to ensure the long-term success of our 
business.
Our strategy helps achieve our purpose: 
enhancing quality of life and contributing to a 
healthier future. Nestlé is always anticipating and 
adapting to the changing world, guided by our 
purpose and our values, as we have since the 
company started 150 years ago. Our purpose 
defines why the world is a better place with 
Nestlé, better for those who enjoy our products 
and services, and for those who are affected by 
our business. It is the inspiration for each and 
every one of us in the company. It aligns our 
actions and creates a common language. It is 
the compass for our decisions and for everything 
we do. It helps ensure we remain a ‘long-term’ 
company delivering with ‘short-term’ intensity, 
investing for future success while ensuring that 
we meet the needs of the billions of people we 
touch every day, and the expectations of our 
shareholders.

of a child. We share his belief that 
through innovation we can enable 
healthier and happier lives. We 
share his passion for creating the

Letter to our shareholders
Fellow shareholders,
The 2012 environment was once again challenging, but it 
also brought opportunities. As such, it was a good example 
of what we characterise as “the new reality”. 
The fact that we delivered for the 17th consecutive time the 
Nestlé Model of organic growth between 5% and 6% together 
with an improvement in our trading operating profit margin in 
such an environment demonstrates the value of having strong 
alignment of our people behind our strategic priorities. 
This strategic alignment provides a framework for 
accelerated innovation, increased engagement with 
consumers and enhanced operational and financial 
performance. It enables us to build appropriate capabilities 
to ensure we remain fit to win in an ever more intense 
environment. It creates a real competitive advantage, 
empowering our people, and unlocking their energy and 
creativity, as we strive to meet and beat our objectives.  
It is a marriage of “global inspiration and local execution”, 
that means we are all on that same roadmap, but are  
always respectful of local cultures, tastes, habits and laws, 
and of the individuality of our consumers.
The 2012 results demonstrate that your company 
has made further progress. Sales were up 10.2% to 
CHF 92.2 billion, with organic growth of 5.9%, incorporating 
real internal growth of 3.1%. The trading operating profit 
was up 11.8% to CHF 14.0 billion and the margin increased 
by 20 basis points to 15.2%. The net profit was up 11.8% 
to CHF 10.6 billion and earnings per share increased 12.2% 
to CHF 3.33 per share. Operating cash flow increased 
from CHF 10.2 billion to CHF 15.8 billion. In view of this 
performance and the company's strong financial position, 
the Board is proposing a dividend of CHF 2.05 per share, up 
from CHF 1.95 last year.
The history of food has been of continual, gradual 
change, accompanied by an increasing understanding of the 
role of nutrition. At first, food was something people needed 
to survive, then something that brought families together, 
gave convenience and pleasure. More recently, it has 
become more consciously a way to bring health benefits. 
And the role of nutrition continues to evolve. In today’s era 
of spiraling healthcare costs, nutritional science can play a 
role in disease prevention and management.
2
As the role of nutrition has evolved, so has Nestlé, adjusting 
our offering to be in line with or anticipate the needs of our 
consumers, whilst staying true to our core business of food, 
beverage and nutrition. Today, our nutrition, health and 
wellness strategy has three aspects:
 – All our food and beverage brands, regardless of category 
or eating occasion, should offer consumers not just the 
best taste and pleasure but also the best nutritional profile 
in their category, as part of a healthy diet.
 – We are targeting particular nutritional needs through 
Nestlé Nutrition, with its Infant, Performance and Weight 
management divisions. 
 – And, through Nestlé Health Science (NHSc) and the  
Nestlé Institute of Health Sciences, which was 
inaugurated in 2012, we are pioneering science-based 
personalised nutritional solutions to prevent and treat 
medical conditions. 
Nutrition is Nestlé’s core. That core was enhanced in 2012 
by acquisitions for both Nestlé Nutrition and NHSc. NHSc 
acquired a stake in Accera, whose key brand is intended 
for the clinical dietary management of Alzheimer’s disease. 
NHSc also created a joint venture with Chi-Med, Nutrition 
Science Partners (NSP), to research and bring to market 
nutritional and medicinal products derived from plants 
with an initial focus on gastrointestinal health. NSP will get 
access to one of the leading traditional Chinese medicine 
libraries.
Nestlé Nutrition’s global leadership in infant nutrition  
was enhanced in November with the acquisition of the 
Wyeth Nutrition business from Pfizer. This business, with 
85% of its sales in emerging markets, is a wonderful fit with 
our existing business, even after the required divestitures. In 
particular, it enhances our position in that category in China. 
China would now be Nestlé’s second biggest market, 
with annualised sales of around CHF 6 billion, including the 
Wyeth Nutrition acquisition and our 2011 partnerships, Yinlu 
and Hsu Fu Chi. Our investments in China, including new 
R&D units in Xiamen and Dongguan, demonstrate our desire 
to benefit from the incredible capabilities and know-how 
which the country has to offer. Another development there 
was the opening of our dairy farming institute in Heilongjiang 
province. The institute aims to be the country’s leading dairy 
training centre. Meanwhile, our work with coffee farmers in

Letter to our shareholders
Yunnan province over the last 20 years was recognised with a 
World Business and Development Award at Rio+20. 
China is just one market where people’s lives are 
changing dramatically and where there are opportunities 
for Nestlé to contribute. There are billions of consumers in 
emerging markets who share the objective of living better 
lives. This is creating a dynamic catalyst for growth and 
development, individually for people, collectively for the 
countries where they live, and for Nestlé. 
We have deep roots in emerging markets, where we  
have continued to expand our presence: in 2012 we opened 
our first factories in Angola and the Democratic Republic  
of Congo. 
As part of our Creating Shared Value strategy, we 
have also extended our relationships with farmers across 
emerging markets. 
 – One example is helping farmers adapt to climate 
change. Since 2001, we have halved our greenhouse gas 
emissions per tonne of product; if we can also reduce the 
environmental impact of our supply chain, this can help 
secure an enhanced supply of higher quality raw materials. 
 – We scaled up the Nestlé Cocoa Plan with a significant 
increase in the amount of cocoa sourced directly from 
farmers, with the intention to reach 15% in 2013. We 
are also working with the Fair Labor Association to help 
eliminate child labour on farms supplying our factories 
and to allow children to attend school.
 – We are working with local authorities in Morocco to 
increase milk production and improve the quality of fresh 
milk. The partnership should benefit 10 000 farmers. 
 – We extended our commitment to Colombian coffee 
farmers for five years and have joined a programme 
to help coffee farmers in Haiti. In Vietnam, we are 
helping 20 000 farmers improve productivity through 
better farming practices and by distributing high-yield, 
disease resistant plantlets. In India, we opened our first 
coffee “demonstration” farm to help improve quality, 
productivity and sustainability.
 – All in all we collaborate with more than 680 000 small-hold 
farmers, mainly in the areas of milk, cocoa and coffee.
The coffee category had a very dynamic year in 2012, and 
Nescafé will be celebrating its 75th anniversary in 2013. 
Nescafé Dolce Gusto is now in 62 markets, and we are 
4
making capacity investments in Germany and the United 
Kingdom. Nespresso continued to grow double-digit, 
and we have announced a CHF 300 million investment in 
Switzerland. The Nescafé systems are also performing well 
in the out-of-home market.
The success of our coffee systems businesses 
demonstrates the importance of R&D to Nestlé. In 2012, we 
celebrated our 100th anniversary in India with the opening 
of a development centre focused on local ingredients 
and popularly positioned products (products designed to 
be affordable on a daily basis for emerging consumers). 
We also began work on an R&D development centre in 
Switzerland to manage our global clinical trials programme. 
R&D brings consumer benefits even in what might be 
imagined to be standard food products, such as Maggi 
cubes in Africa. These are in fact fortified with iron and 
iodine helping to address micronutrient deficiencies; Nestlé 
can use its R&D capabilities and credibility to be part of the 
solution to health issues ranging from malnutrition to obesity 
by enriching the dialogue around health and nutrition issues. 
With this in mind, we launched several initiatives in 2012. 
 – We are supporting the United Nations Education 
First initiative, committing to teach over six million 
children in 60 countries the value of good nutrition and 
physical activity. This is part of the Nestlé Healthy Kids 
Programme, which we plan to extend to 70 countries by 
2016, in association with the International Association 
of Athletics Federations. We are also a sponsor of the 
“Institute for Healthy Childhood Weight”, established 
by the American Academy of Pediatrics. It will produce 
clear, accessible resources for health professionals, 
communities and parents, based on government policies 
and scientific evidence. 
 – Healthy aging is another key issue. The 9th Nestlé 
International Nutrition Symposium, attended by 
over 150 world-renowned scientists and healthcare 
professionals, addressed this. We also launched the 
“Elderly Care – Health Project” in China to enable 
elderly people to receive free heart checks and health 
consultations.
A priority for R&D is to advance food and nutrition science. 
In 2012 our projects included childhood allergies, diabetes, 
osteoporosis, inflammatory bowel disease, healthy

hydration, immune systems, healthier alternatives to salt, 
and the impact of dark chocolate on stress, as well as 
agriculture, packaging and environmental life cycle analysis 
of products. A strong R&D capability is at the heart of our 
ambition to be the trusted leader in Nutrition, Health and 
Wellness. As such, it is a prerequisite for a successful future, 
together with a willingness to invest and a focus on the 
longer term, regardless of shorter-term challenges. 
Critical to our success in the future is the development 
of people, the management of career paths and succession 
planning. Nestlé now has about 339 000 people, with 
thousands having joined in the last two years. They have 
found themselves part of a decentralised organisation 
which is aligned, entrepreneurial and fast moving wherever 
it operates, and which is linked together by firm values 
and principles, including a warm appreciation for the 
benefits of diversity. We have welcomed them into our 
group, expecting many to benefit from the international 
opportunities that we offer as their careers progress. 
It is fundamental that a company such as Nestlé plays 
a positive role in society. Indeed, we believe that we will 
create long-term value for our shareholders only if we 
connect positively with society at large. This is what we call 
“Creating Shared Value”. We have discussed in this letter 
how we use our know-how and resources not just to ensure 
that we run our business sustainably, but also to play a 
broad role in society. The accompanying Nestlé in society  
report details our approach and lists various commitments 
that we have made around nutrition, compliance and 
environmental sustainability amongst others. 
This commitment to Creating Shared Value stands front 
and centre as we pursue our objective of being the reference 
for financial performance in our industry and, as such,  
is a priority for your Board.
The Board’s other priorities in 2012 included the Wyeth 
Nutrition acquisition and the related funding strategy, 
balance sheet management and capital allocation, the 
management of the Group’s pensions, the asset and liability 
review, as well as reviewing the direction of our Nutrition, 
Health and Wellness strategy.
André Kudelski, will retire from our Board after twelve 
years. We would like to thank him for his greatly appreciated 
contribution. Peter Brabeck-Letmathe, Steven G. Hoch,

a member of our Nomination Committee; Titia de Lange, 
a member of Nestlé’s Nutrition Council; and Jean-Pierre 
Roth, a member of our Compensation Committee, are 
standing for re-election. Eva Cheng, of Chinese nationality, 
will be proposed for election to the Board. She is the former 
Corporate Executive Vice President responsible for Greater 
China and Southeast Asia Region of Amway Corporation, a 
U.S. based global consumer product company. We believe 
that with her extensive business experience and strong 
entrepreneurial background, Ms Cheng will enrich our 
Board’s business competencies particularly in light of our 
expanding footprint in Asia.
There were changes to the Executive Board in 2012. 
James Singh retired as Chief Financial Officer and was 
succeeded by Wan Ling Martello, who joined the Group in 
2011. The Board thanks Jim for his many years of service. 
Kurt Schmidt decided to leave the company, and was 
replaced by Luis Cantarell as Head of Nestlé Nutrition. 
Luis will combine this position with running Nestlé Health 
Science, though the two businesses will remain separate.
As always, it is our pleasure to express our gratitude to 
all our people on behalf of the Board and our shareholders. 
The year under review has been another chacterised by 
difficulties and challenges, whether caused by natural 
disasters, civil unrest or the macro issues in many countries. 
Regardless, our people have continued to devote their 
energies and resourcefulness to ensuring that our company 
continues to perform to the highest levels and standards. 
Our thanks go to all of them.
The environment looks to be every bit as challenging 
in 2013 as it was in 2012. But 2013 will again provide 
opportunities to leverage our competitive advantages, 
deliver on our growth opportunities and benefit from our 
drive for continuous improvement across the Group. We 
expect, therefore, to deliver the Nestlé Model once again 
in 2013: organic growth between 5% and 6% together 
with an improved trading operating profit margin and 
underlying earnings per share in constant currency, as well 
as improvement in our capital efficiency.

Corporate Governance 
and Compliance
Board of Directors of Nestlé S.A.
at 31 December 2012
Corporate Governance
The prerequisite for a company to engage with society is 
compliance and effective governance. The Chairman and 
the CEO ensure the tone of good governance at Board level 
and below on the basis of strong principles that provide the 
framework of how we do business. 
In our Corporate Governance Report we outline how  
our governance ensures the effectiveness of our Board.  
It explains the role of our Board and its committees, Board 
processes and risk oversight in line with established best 
practices. Our Compensation Report is submitted annually 
to a separate advisory vote of our shareholders. The Board 
regularly solicits the input from investors, governance experts 
and proxy advisors on our governance. Resulting changes are 
described in the report and explained to shareholders prior to 
the relevant vote at the Annual General Meeting.
We integrate the reporting of financial and non  
financial performance measures along the lines of the UN 
Global Compact Principles for Responsible Investment 
(UNPRI) and the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), which 
plays a critical role in demonstrating our commitments  
on governance, environmental, social, ethical and 
sustainability issues. 
Good governance helps us create and maintain trust 
with our employees, investors, governments, NGOs, our 
customers, consumers and other stakeholders. In our Nestlé 
in society report we demonstrate how we engage with 
society at large. Conditioned upon strong compliance, we 
aim to run our business sustainably and for the long term. 
This gives us the legitimacy to engage with society in a way 
that leads to the creation of shared value.
Nestlé has a highly diversified ownership structure, 
and we use a number of ways to communicate with our 
shareholders. Through shareholder surveys, investor 
roundtables, analyst and engagement calls, and bilateral 
meetings, we have established a dialogue with our investors, 
pursuing a holistic approach that manages both their 
financial and governance expectations. 
We are actively engaged in the development of Swiss law 
and governance practices. In 2012, focus was on the proper 
functioning of the voting chain and the development of a 
Swiss Code of Best Practice for the Exercise of Voting Rights 
by Institutional Investors.

“Good compliance is a condition for us 
to engage credibly with society. Beyond 
compliance, we do business sustainably – 
preserving our business and our environment 
for future generations.”
Corporate Governance and Compliance
We continue to pursue initiatives to improve dialogue with 
all our stakeholders on the basis of the clear expectations 
set in the purpose clause of our Articles of Association, 
where we have committed ourselves to aim for long-term, 
sustainable value creation. 
Compliance
We will not sacrifice our principles and values for short-term 
success. Compliance with laws, codes of conduct and 
our own principles forms the basis of how we do business 
and is the foundation on which we engage with society. 
While responsibility is assigned to the markets as per our 
Custodian Concept, a dedicated corporate Compliance 
function and a cross-functional Compliance Committee 
define the framework, facilitate the coordination between 
the relevant support functions and provide guidance and 
best practices in a holistic approach to Governance, Risk and 
Compliance (GRC). 
The right commitment and tone at the top foster a  
strong, principles-based compliance culture. The ten 
principles of our Corporate Business Principles provide the 
over-arching framework. Various corporate functions ensure 
their continued implementation. Our Management  
and Leadership Principles, our Code of Business Conduct  
and our Supplier Code are other cornerstones of our  
cross-functional Corporate Compliance Programme. 
Awareness campaigns and regular risk assessments help us 
implement and develop relevant best practices. Compliance 
is regularly monitored by our corporate functions, internal 
and external audit, and through our expanded CARE audit 
programme relying on an independent external audit 
network. In our performance evaluations compliance is 
linked to “how” goals were accomplished.
Our anti-bribery and antitrust programmes included 
global training initiatives in 2012. Our integrity reporting 
system was rolled out globally to deal with compliance 
related grievances, complementing the “whistleblower 
procedure” introduced with our Code of Business 
Conduct. Fraud, employment conditions, privacy and 
regulatory compliance were other focus areas. We use 
our Nestlé Continuous Excellence (NCE) framework to 
foster a common understanding of compliance across 
the functions. This includes the verification of appropriate

As the new century dawned, we saw change coming. The IT industry  
and the broader economy were being transformed by the rising tide of  
global integration, by a new computing model and by new client needs  
for integration and innovation.
And that meant we needed to transform ourselves.
1. We changed our business mix toward  
higher-value, more profitable technologies  
and market opportunities.

2. We became a globally integrated enterprise,  
improving productivity and capturing new growth.
Since 2005, global integration has enabled IBM to gain $6 billion in 
productivity savings while improving service quality. We have shifted 
resources toward building client relationships and employee skills, 
while positioning IBM for new market opportunities, such as business 
analytics, Smarter Cities and infrastructure build-outs underway in 
emerging markets.

Financial Performance History 
(% of total revenue, $ in billions)
We achieved record earnings per share. 
Diluted earnings per share in 2010 were $11.52, having nearly 
tripled since the end of 2000, and marking eight consecutive 
years of double-digit growth. Our focus on productivity  
and a continuing shift in our business mix to more profitable 
segments has helped drive our performance. 
And record cash performance.  
In 2010 our free cash flow, excluding the year-to-year change in 
Global Financing receivables, was $16.3 billion—an increase of 
$1.2 billion from 2009. Since the end of 2000 we have generated 
$109 billion in free cash flow.

Since the end of 2000, we invested $43 billion in capital

targeted toward high-value areas.
We returned $89 billion to our shareholders as share repurchases  
and increased our dividend each year over the last decade.  
At the end of 2010 our quarterly dividend per share was five

5.  Today, we run a business model that delivers  
long-term value and high performance.
Early in 2007, we established our earnings per share road map  
to 2010.  It provided clarity about our business model, objectives  
and key factors driving performance. The road map also aligned  
all IBMers against a set of long-term objectives. 
We achieved $11.52 of EPS in 2010, well above the high  
end of the range of $10 to $11 during one of the toughest  
economic environments in decades. 
This resulted in superior returns to investors over the  
road map period. 
Now, our 2015 Road Map continues the drive to higher  
value—with the expectation of at least $20 operating EPS  
in five years (non-GAAP).*
Key objectives over the next five years:
•  $100 billion in free cash flow
•   Software becomes about 
•  $70 billion of capital returned

Today our investments are fueling growth initiatives 
that are expected to drive $20 billion in incremental 
revenue by 2015.
Growth Markets
Approaches 
30%
of IBM’s  
geographic revenue by 2015 
Opportunity:  
The emerging market GDP growth  
rate—expected to be 5 percent  
through 2015—is more than double  
that of major markets.   
2015 Road Map Objective:  
Growth Markets revenue  
approaches 30 percent of IBM’s  
geographic revenue by 2015.
Cloud
$7billion  
in revenue by 2015
Opportunity:  
Cloud is a new, highly efficient model  
for consuming and delivering IT-based 
services. It is made possible by virtualizing 
resources, automating processes  
and standardizing tasks so they can be  
offered as easy-to-use services.
2015 Road Map Objective:  
Cloud revenue is expected to be  
$7 billion by 2015, of which $3 billion  
is incremental.
A historic economic expansion is underway in the  
emerging markets of the world—as their populations  
join the middle class and their economies join the global 
marketplace. In the largest of these emerging markets, 
such as China, India and Brazil, IBM is broadening  
its well-established base of skills and capabilities, nearly 
doubling our number of branch locations. In less  
developed markets, such as Africa, we are leveraging 
anchor clients in sectors like communications and  
banking. Our recent partnership with Bharti Airtel Africa to 
provide 21st century wireless telecommunications across  
16 countries of Sub-Saharan Africa is one example.
IBM has helped thousands of clients in areas as diverse  
as banking, healthcare and government build their own 
clouds or securely tap into IBM cloud-based business and 
infrastructure services. IBM manages millions of cloud-
based transactions every day and provides cloud analytics 
services to clients like Seton Hall University, Petco, Speedo 
and Crocs.
ING, a major player in the financial services industry, 
engaged IBM to design and build a cloud platform that will 
speed the delivery of new services to millions of clients and 
employees. Danone is working with IBM to provide a secure 
cloud trading network for its customers and business 
partners, while ADP is using IBM’s cloud integration 
software to expand its tax filing offerings to new markets 
serving employers of all sizes.

Business Analytics
$16billion  
in revenue by 2015
Opportunity:  
Global data volumes are predicted  
to increase by 29 times over the next  
10 years to 35 zettabytes.* (A zettabyte  
is a 1 followed by 21 zeros.) 
2015 Road Map Objective:  
Business analytics revenue is   
expected to be $16 billion by 2015.
Smarter Planet
$10billion  
in revenue by 2015
Opportunity:   
The infusion of digital intelligence into 
industries, infrastructures, processes  
and cities can make them more  
productive, efficient and responsive. 
2015 Road Map Objective:  
Smarter Planet revenue is expected  
to be $10 billion by 2015.
Enterprises need a way to manage and mine the deluge  
of potentially valuable information, and the key is advanced 
data analytics. IBM spotted this emerging need early, 
building the world’s leading analytics practice—with  
7,800 expert consultants, the world’s premier nonacademic 
mathematics function and the acquisition of 25 companies, 
for $14 billion in gross spending, to deepen our capabilities.
Our scientists have received more than 500 analytics 
patents. They are expanding technology frontiers through 
breakthroughs like the powerful new computer named 
Watson, which competed and won on the television  
quiz show Jeopardy! Applying Watson’s use of advanced 
analytics to decipher natural language, IBM is working  
to identify better healthcare diagnoses, potential  
drug interactions and “what if” scenarios in finance  
and compliance.
In 2008 and 2009, we articulated a point of view on ways 
the world can become smarter, and in 2010, we deployed 
significant resources to capture the opportunity in key, 
high-growth industries where our experience and solution 
delivery is strongest. We also expanded our Smarter Cities 
initiative, targeting local leaders who influence trillions in 
spending worldwide. In Rio de Janeiro, IBM is developing  
a system to integrate real-time information and processes 
across many city departments, including civil defense, 
transportation and meteorology, for a sustainable opera-
tions infrastructure in the face of unprecedented growth. 
Similar city infrastructure projects are underway in cities 
across the world such as Ho Chi Minh City, Shanghai, 
Seoul, Sydney, Helsinki, Amsterdam, Rotterdam, San 
Francisco and Washington, D.C.

TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS, CUSTOMERS, PARTNERS AND EMPLOYEES:  
It is a humbling experience to write this letter to you as only the third CEO in Microsoft’s history. As I said when I took this 
role, I originally joined Microsoft to have an opportunity to change the world through technology and empower people to do 
amazing things. Many companies aspire to change the world, but very few have the talent, resources and perseverance of 
Microsoft.  
I believe this is a landmark moment for the company and for our industry as a whole. Cloud and mobile technologies are 
redefining how people work and play. Three billion people will soon be connected to Internet-enabled devices; 212 billion 
sensors will come online  in a few short  years; trillions will be  spent  in consumer and business technologies. But  it’s  not 
about  technology  for  technology’s  sake!  It’s  our  mission  to  enable  the  use  of  technology  to  realize  the  true  potential  of 
people, teams and organizations.  
As I shared in my email to employees in July, we will be the productivity and platform company for this mobile-first and 
cloud-first world. We will empower every person and every organization on the planet to do more and achieve more. And 
we will accomplish this by building incredible Digital Work and Life Experiences, supported by our Cloud Operating System, 
the Device Operating System and Hardware platforms.  
In the same way that we aspired to and achieved our original  vision of a PC on every desk and in  every  home,  we will 
reinvent productivity. This clarity of purpose and boldness of our aspiration inspires me and all of us at Microsoft.  
We began to take steps toward this core focus last fiscal year.  
To drive our mobile strategy, we acquired Nokia’s Devices and Services business, creating an expanded Microsoft Devices 
Group  that  includes  Nokia  phones,  Xbox  hardware,  Surface,  Perceptive  Pixel  products  and  accessories.  We  also 
announced Office on iPad, which led to 35 million downloads of Word, Excel, PowerPoint and OneNote – becoming many 
of the most popular applications in the Apple App Store.  
In addition, we introduced Cortana, a personal assistant built into Windows Phone 8.1 that learns and provides information 
proactively to users, while protecting their privacy. And we launched the Surface Pro 3, a groundbreaking new tablet built 
to  replace  your  laptop.  Finally,  we  provided  Windows  licenses  at  zero  dollars  for  any  original  equipment  manufacturer 
building a device less than nine inches in size, which we expect to drive an amazing mix of innovative, low-cost devices for 
consumers this year.  
We continued to build upon our success in the cloud. Commercial cloud revenue hit a $4.4 billion annual run-rate, making 
us an undisputed leader; we grew Hyper-V to 30.6 percent of the market, taking share from competitors; and we expanded 
our datacenter footprint into Australia, Brazil, Japan and China. We brought industry-leading in-memory technology to the 
new version of SQL Server 2014, and we launched two cloud-based services – the Enterprise Mobility Suite for handling 
identity and security on devices, and the Azure Intelligent Systems Service for managing the “Internet of Things.”  
Despite  this  busy  year  of  new  products  and  significant  change  for  the  company,  we  delivered  strong  results,  including 
revenue of more than $86 billion, gross margin of nearly $60 billion and operating income of $27.8 billion. We also returned 
more than $15.7 billion in cash to our shareholders, a 27 percent increase from 2013.  
Looking forward, we  have a rich product road map that  positions  us to thrive  in a mobile-first  and cloud-first world. For 
example, we recently  launched Delve, an Office 365 cloud-based  service that automatically  brings  relevant documents, 
data  and  other  artifacts  to  workers.  And  we  announced  our  intention  to  acquire  Mojang,  the  Stockholm-based  game 
developer of the popular “Minecraft” franchise, a game that spans PCs, consoles, tablets and mobile. We also plan to launch 
Skype  Translator  this  fiscal  year,  which  has  the  potential  to  dramatically  break  down  language  barriers  in  our 
communications. And, perhaps most important, we recently previewed new features and innovations in the next version of 
Windows, Windows 10.  
All of these new services and experiences will be underpinned by significant investments in our cloud strategy – including 
building  more  datacenters  and  increasing  capacity  in  existing  regions;  expanding  our  hybrid  cloud  offerings  with  new 
releases of StorSimple, InMage and other products; and launching new cloud capabilities, such as Azure Machine Learning, 
an offering that has the potential to be game-changing in helping people mine data for predictions.

As CEO, I am committed to ensuring Microsoft makes the most of this landmark moment. And, at the same time, it is equally 
important to evolve our culture – becoming more customer-obsessed across all our products, focusing on leading indicators 
like usage, and ensuring Microsoft continues to be the best place for smart, curious people to do great work.  
I believe reinventing productivity and building platforms that empower every person and organization on the planet to do 
more and achieve more is a huge undertaking. But it is one that Microsoft is uniquely qualified to take on. We are ready 
again to change the world.  
Thank you for your continued support,  
Satya Nadella

BUSINESS DESCRIPTION  
GENERAL  
Microsoft was founded in 1975. Our mission is to enable people and organizations throughout the world to do more and 
achieve more by creating technology that transforms the way people learn, work, play, and communicate. We develop and 
market software, services, and devices that deliver new opportunities, greater convenience, and enhanced value to people’s 
lives. We do business worldwide and have offices in more than 100 countries.  
We  generate  revenue  by  developing,  licensing,  and  supporting  a  wide  range  of  software  products  and  services,  by 
designing, manufacturing, and selling devices, and by delivering relevant online advertising to a global customer audience. 
In addition to selling individual products and services, we offer suites of products and services.  
Our  products  include  operating  systems  for  computing  devices,  servers,  phones,  and  other  intelligent  devices;  server 
applications for distributed computing environments; productivity applications; business solution applications; desktop and 
server  management  tools;  software  development  tools;  video  games;  and  online  advertising.  We  also  design  and  sell 
hardware  including  PCs,  tablets,  gaming  and  entertainment  consoles,  phones,  other  intelligent  devices,  and  related 
accessories.  
We offer cloud-based  solutions that provide customers  with  software,  services, and content over the  Internet by way  of 
shared computing  resources  located  in centralized data  centers. Examples of cloud-based computing  services we offer 
include Bing, Microsoft Azure, Microsoft Dynamics CRM Online, Microsoft Office 365, OneDrive, Skype, Xbox Live, and 
Yammer. Cloud revenue is earned primarily from usage fees, advertising, and subscriptions. We also provide consulting 
and product and solution support services, and we train and certify computer system integrators and developers.  
We conduct research and develop advanced technologies for future software, devices, and services. We believe that we 
will continue to grow and meet our customers’ needs as the productivity and platform company for the mobile-first and cloud-
first world. We will continue to create new opportunities for partners, increase customer satisfaction, and improve our service 
excellence, business efficacy, and internal processes.  
OPERATING SEGMENTS  
During the first quarter of fiscal year 2014, we changed our organizational structure as part of our transformation to a devices 
and services company. As a result, information that our chief operating decision maker regularly reviews for purposes of 
allocating  resources  and  assessing  performance  changed.  Therefore,  beginning  in  fiscal  year  2014,  we  reported  our 
financial performance based on our new segments: Devices and Consumer (“D&C”) Licensing, D&C Hardware, D&C Other, 
Commercial Licensing, and Commercial Other.  On April 25, 2014, we completed the transaction to acquire substantially all 
of Nokia Corporation’s (“Nokia”) Devices and Services Business (“NDS”). We report the financial performance of NDS in 
our  new  Phone  Hardware  segment.  Prior  to  the  acquisition  of  NDS,  financial  results  associated  with  our  joint  strategic 
initiatives with Nokia were reflected in our D&C Licensing segment. The contractual relationship with Nokia related to those 
initiatives terminated in conjunction with the acquisition. With the creation of the new Phone Hardware segment, the D&C 
Hardware segment was renamed Computing and Gaming Hardware in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014.

Pursuing significant 
global opportunities
Dear fellow shareholders,
As the Good food, Good life company, Nestlé  
is proud to provide consumers with products 
they love and rely on. Even in the face of ongoing 
global challenges this past year, we stay true to 
our long-term ambitions and see a bright future 
with emerging opportunities.
Nutrition, Health and Wellness is our past, present  
and future, and within that frame we continue to set  
new priorities. Our innovation capabilities enable us  
to consistently meet the rising expectations of a 
growing population. Portfolio optimization over the 
past years allows us to focus our efforts on our proven 
brands. Our operational excellence enables us to 
dependably deliver sustainable, profitable growth. And 
we continue to do business in a way that creates shared 
value for both our shareholders and society. 
Encouraging balanced diets
Foods and beverages are major drivers of long-term 
health, and consumers increasingly recognize this. We 
will continue to develop nutritious products that support 
people’s well-being, and we believe that such products 
will see increased demand in the years to come. 
In fact, in 2023, we reconfirmed our ambition to 
prioritize the development of our more nutritious 
products. This entails launching new products and 
renovating existing ones. It involves expanding 
micronutrient fortification, growing our affordable 
offerings, reducing sugar and salt content, and 
increasing our use of plant-based ingredients in 
our recipes.
2
Additionally, we are actively guiding people towards 
a more balanced diet by making the nutritional value 
of our portfolio more transparent. We are strengthening 
our responsible marketing of indulgent products, 
providing clear front-of-pack portion guidance, and 
engaging with and informing consumers through our 
various online communities around the world. 
Supporting healthy aging
Nestlé’s food and beverage portfolio caters to people 
at each stage of their life. It starts with the first 
1000 days and continues into adulthood and old age. 
With a rapidly aging global population, we see an 
opportunity to provide products that can support the 
nutrition, health and wellness of older people. We can 
help boost their energy levels, enhance their cognitive 
health, support their mobility, and improve their general 
physical and mental health. 
We already offer several Nestlé Health Science and 
dairy products that are specifically targeted to seniors. 
Take, for example, successful brands like Boost, Pure 
Encapsulations or Molico. With our capabilities, we 
believe that we can leverage this trend across all of our 
categories to further grow. 
Investing in innovation 
We are investing in our future through innovation 
and entrepreneurship. Through our main research 
center in Switzerland and 23 sites globally, and with 
an industry-leading R&D budget, we develop products 
tailored to the diverse needs of people and pets while 
reducing our environmental footprint. Experts at our 
newly inaugurated Institute of Agricultural Sciences, 
for example, develop solutions in the areas of plant 
science, agricultural systems and dairy livestock.  
This is in addition to our four other research institutes 
looking at health sciences, food sciences, food safety 
and packaging. 
Digital technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI), 
are supporting sharper decision-making and increased 
speed across the entire company. From procurement to 
e-commerce, digital analytics facilitate efficiency and

effectiveness. Data science and AI increasingly support 
us with innovation by revealing and predicting consumer 
demands, while also helping us bring new products to 
market faster.
Creating Shared Value
Creating Shared Value is how we do business at Nestlé, 
generating value not only for our shareholders but also 
for society. Nestlé’s long-term success is supported  
by this approach.
An example of this is Nestlé’s efforts to advance 
regenerative food production by helping protect, renew 
and restore natural resources. To that end, we are 
supporting farmers and strengthening their communities. 
We are delivering on our commitments in a way that 
appeals to consumers’ increased expectations.
Remaining dedicated and dependable
Every year, our people show us how much can be 
achieved when we steadfastly pursue opportunities. We 
know that we do not have all the answers, but with our 
global mindset combined with our expert knowledge of 
local consumers and markets, we are confident we can 
deliver on our ambition and our commitments. 
People all over the world rely on Nestlé for good food  
and beverages. Our proven value creation model allows 
us to invest, innovate and grow even in challenging 
times, and makes us dependable for our shareholders 
and other stakeholders. We are grateful for the support 
of our employees, business partners, consumers and 
communities. And we thank you, our shareholders, for 
your continued trust.

Our purpose is unlocking the power of food to enhance 
quality of life for everyone, today and for generations 
to come. To achieve this, we pursue growth through 
rapid innovation, operational efficiency, and disciplined 
resource and capital allocation. 
Our portfolio is diversified, both in terms of geography 
and category. We have products for people at all life 
stages that can be consumed as part of a balanced 
diet. We want to contribute to people’s health through 
nutrition and aim to help people of all ages live better. 
Our innovation capabilities ensure we deliver products 
that meet consumer needs and preferences, and are 
good for the planet. Through digital technologies, we 
are able to be more agile and make better and faster 
decisions. 
Driving organic sales growth 
Organic sales growth is key to our growth ambition.  
Our portfolio is geared to deliver sustained mid single-
digit organic sales growth based on investment in 
attractive categories and regions, impactful innovation 
and execution discipline. Our knowledge of local 
consumers coupled with our scientific and technological 
expertise help us deliver innovations that support 
business growth, while meeting consumer needs.  
We also see many opportunities for growth through 
cross-fertilization between categories and geographies. 
In addition to core innovation activities focused on 
food safety, taste, nutrition and sustainability, we have 
intensified research in high-growth categories, such as 
early-life and therapeutic nutrition, alternative proteins, 
and coffee and systems technology. Ecosystem building 
and business model innovation are also increasingly  
a focus of our categories.
Alongside innovation, we continue to optimize our 
portfolio to focus on stronger brands and products.
Innovating across life stages and health needs
The foods and beverages people consume play a pivotal 
role in their overall health. From pre-conception to early 
life, through to childhood, adulthood and old age, we aim 
to meet people’s nutritional and health needs throughout 
their lives. 
Nestlé has deep roots in infant nutrition. For years, 
we have researched the composition of nutrients 
and bioactives present in breastmilk as well as the 
role of probiotics in nutrition and health. Exploring 
the interaction between these different components, 
Nestlé experts discovered a proprietary probiotic strain, 
B. infantis, that unlocks beneficial aspects of six human 
milk oligosaccharides (HMOs). This led to the launch in 
2023 of our proprietary blend, Sinergity, for use in infant 
formulas to support immunity and gut health. 
As we continue our tradition of supporting children’s 
health, we also need to consider an aging population 
that is living longer. Under our R+D Accelerator initiative, 
we developed the Nestlé Goodnes range of products in 
2023 to support healthy aging. It helps optimize people’s 
energy levels, restore their sleep quality and improve 
their focus through patented nutritional blends. The 
products were piloted in France, Singapore and the UK. 
Additionally, we launched the Nestlé N3 range in China 
that helps people maintain their overall health and well-
being as they age. 
Expanding alternative proteins
In 2023, we added to our plant-based portfolio by 
launching a range of vegan alternatives to fish filets, 
nuggets and fingers that stand out for their strong 
nutrition credentials, as well as their great taste and 
texture that is close to white fish. Garden Gourmet 
launched Marine-Style Crispy Filet and Marine-Style 
Crispy Nuggets in Europe, and Harvest Gourmet launched 
Crispy Fish-Free Fingers in Asia.
We also continued to explore new concepts for dairy 
alternatives. Made with a blend of oat and fava, the new 
natural bliss beverages are a good source of high-quality 
protein. Our teams chose fava beans because of their 
many health benefits and good taste. 
In addition, we combined the goodness of milk with  
plant-based ingredients in our new Nido Milk & Soya  
instant powder launched in Central and West Africa and  
Nestlé is exploring 
emerging technologies 
like animal-free dairy 
beverages made with 
precision fermentation, 
which led to a pilot  
for Cowabunga in  
the United States.

in our Bear Brand Doble Protein powdered beverage 
piloted in the Philippines. Both products are highly 
nutritious and affordable. 
Making innovation faster and more efficient
We are using AI and data science to complement our 
R&D capabilities and manage complexities during 
innovation. Our new recipe optimization tool uses 
advanced algorithms to help product developers better 
manage tradeoffs between ingredients, nutrition, cost and 
sustainability, while still meeting consumer expectations. 
In the development of the new Nescafé Dolce Gusto Neo 
coffee system, our experts optimized the manufacturing 
process through virtual simulations before applying 
technical settings on the physical machine. This helped 
them make quick and efficient decisions to manage 
the complex interaction between coffee, paper packaging 
material and the machine to ensure the perfect coffee cup 
for consumers.
Improving efficiency with digital technologies
Digitalization is enabling better and faster decision-
making, in addition to improving cost efficiencies.  
We are harmonizing our data framework to be able  
to take advantage of different technologies, like AI. 
The Nestlé Supplier Portal, a global digital collaboration 
platform, supports quality document management, 
sustainability data collection and supplier performance 
management. With over 7000 active suppliers in over 
40 markets, it covers almost three-quarters of our direct 
material spend. 
10
Leveraging always-on analytics 
We are responding to fast-changing consumer needs 
in real time, using data to streamline our business 
processes. Our strategic procurement decisions are 
more informed, as we increasingly leverage advanced 
statistical modeling with machine learning and 
automated price-trend analytics. And by deploying new 
marketing analytics capabilities at scale, we are building 
data foundation pipelines that automatically refresh our 
marketing effectiveness models for faster and smarter 
investment decisions.
In 2023, we spent 68% of our media budget digitally 
and acquired 308 million first-party data records. We are 
on track to meet our 2025 goals of 70% and 400 million 
respectively. Using AI, this data helps our brands reach 
target audiences more efficiently and deliver more 
relevant, personalized messages online. 
Accelerating e-commerce
Our ambition for 2025 is that a quarter of our sales 
come from e-commerce. This will have a significant 
impact on all markets, brands and roles. To support 
this, we launched an e-commerce academy that offers 
personalized learning paths. Over 1500 employees were 
trained and certified in 2023.
We have also launched our own eB2B platforms in key 
markets such as Brazil, India, Mexico and Vietnam, and 
have partnered with other leading platforms, such as 
the eB2B platform BEES.

Delivering  
novel  
technologies
Thanks to our strong global 
capabilities, we continue to develop 
exciting innovations that can be 
applied across different products, 
brands and categories. 
One of our latest unique science-
based innovations is Nestlé N3 milk, 
which offers new nutritional benefits. 
Made from cow’s milk, it has all the 
essential nutrients found in milk, 
including proteins, vitamins and 
minerals. In addition, it also contains 
beneficial prebiotic fibers and has

a low lactose content and over 15% 
fewer calories.
IN FIGURES
Using a proprietary technology, we 
use specialized enzymes to break 
down lactose, a sugar found in cow’s 
milk, while generating prebiotic fibers. 
Clinical studies showed that the 
fibers promote the growth of multiple 
types of bifidobacteria, delivering gut 
microbiome benefits in healthy adults.
N3 milk was first introduced in 2023, 
in a range of powdered dairy products 
in China, tailored to meet the dietary 
needs of local consumers. The N3 
range includes a full cream and a 
skimmed milk product, both high 
in protein and perfect for the whole 
family. To support specific needs for 
healthy aging, the range includes 
two products with vitamins, minerals 
and probiotics to support bone 
health, muscle growth and strength, 
and immunity.
N3 milk will be introduced in other 
product categories later, enabling us  
to support health and well-being 
across life stages.

Dear fellow shareholders,
For over 150 years, Nestlé has built its success 
on a profound understanding of nutrition. That 
success is based on a continuous, compelling 
strategy that leads to sustainable value creation. 
It is also based on the ability to change and adapt. 
2017 was no exception. It has been a year of both 
continuity and change. We continued to build 
our company for the long term, while increasing 
speed and efficiency to adapt to the changes 
around us. Competition is intensifying and 
consumers’ expectations are shifting. Likewise, 
digital disruption is reshaping how consumers 
connect and communicate, buy products, and 
engage with companies. We are anticipating 
these changes and responding to them with a 
healthy sense of urgency, setting an agile course 
for the future.
For the year 2017, Nestlé’s organic growth 
was 2.4%, supported by real internal growth 
of 1.6%. Pricing of 0.8% was consistent  
with the prior year. Net divestments reduced sales 
by 1.9% and foreign exchange had a minimal 
negative impact of 0.1%. Total reported sales 
increased by 0.4% to CHF 89.8 billion. Organic 
growth was 4.8% in emerging markets and 
0.7% in developed markets. Underlying Trading 
operating profit margin was up by 50 basis points  
in constant currency and up 40 basis points  
on a reported basis to 16.4%. Based on these 
results, the Board of Directors is proposing 
the 23rd dividend increase, underlining  
our commitment to continuity, of 5 centimes  
to CHF 2.35 per share this year.
A clear path forward
Nutrition is at the heart of our company. It has 
been since Henri Nestlé invented the farine lactée 
that saved the life of a child. Our Nutrition, Health 
and Wellness strategy is now more relevant than 
ever as people around the globe want to lead 
healthier lives. They are more interested in the 
role nutrition plays in their personal health and 
well‑being. We are well positioned to support 
them, providing quality, nutritious food and 
beverages that are both delicious and convenient. 
Nestlé has a broad portfolio that includes some 
of the world’s most recognised brands. We are 
a leader in many of the fastest‑growing food and 
beverages categories.
2
During the year, we confirmed our long‑term value 
creation model. Our mid‑term targets underscore 
our commitment to the right balance of top‑line 
growth and bottom‑line performance. We have 
set an underlying trading operating profit margin 
target of 17.5% to 18.5% by 2020, up from 16% in 
2016. We aim to achieve mid‑single digit organic 
growth by 2020.
Food and beverages are at the core of our 
business, with many different categories. To 
grow steadily, we are managing the categories of 
coffee, pet care, bottled water and infant nutrition 
for growth. Consumer healthcare is an additional 
area for growth, especially in meeting the 
nutritional needs of ageing populations around  
the world. Furthermore, we are building on our 
strong position in emerging markets by allocating 
capital for growth.
We are actively developing our portfolio to 
reflect new consumer tastes and lifestyles. Our 
aim is to have the tastiest and healthiest products 
in each of the categories in which we compete. 
We are capitalising on recent consumer trends 
such as organic, whole grain, reduced calorie 
and natural foods. We are also delivering more 
plant‑based alternatives.
Continuous innovation is a key differentiator 
for Nestlé, fueling growth from within the 
company. Driven by our industry‑leading research 
and development network, combined with 
deep consumer insights, we are speeding up 
meaningful innovation to bring products and 
services to the market quickly.
In 2017, several acquisitions helped to 
strengthen our positions in fast‑growing categories  
and to give access to new business models. 
Responding to consumer demand for new coffee 
experiences, we took a majority stake in the U.S. 
coffee roaster and retailer Blue Bottle Coffee and 
acquired Chameleon Cold Brew, the number one 
organic cold brew brand in the United States. 
With the market for healthy, convenient meals 
growing, we acquired Sweet Earth – a California 
based frozen meals company offering high‑quality 
vegetarian dishes. We also bought a minority 
interest in the online meal delivery platform, 
Freshly. In consumer healthcare, we announced 
the acquisition of Atrium Innovations, a global 
leader in nutritional health products.

Letter to our shareholders
Increased efficiency
To support our growth, we are increasing operating 
efficiency across the company. We are focusing 
on structural cost savings in the non‑consumer 
facing areas, specifically in manufacturing, 
procurement and administrative services.
our value creation model. As a result, we can 
return more capital to our shareholders. In June, 
the Board approved a share buyback programme 
of up to CHF 20 billion which is to be completed 
by the end of June 2020, conditional to any 
sizeable acquisitions.
We are simplifying our manufacturing footprint 
Our Board ensured the transition to a new  
and optimising our factories to utilise capacity 
more effectively. To leverage our size and scale in 
our procurement activities, we have established 
three global purchasing hubs. By 2020, we expect 
these hubs to source 60% of our requirements. 
Through Nestlé Business Excellence, we continue 
to simplify, standardise and share services and 
processes. We aim to increase the penetration 
of shared services to 50% by 2020, up from the 
current level of around 17%.
We are also simplifying our organisation 
by delayering functions and strengthening 
local and regional decision‑making. We have 
reorganised our infant nutrition business, 
moving it from the Globally‑Managed Nestlé 
Nutrition to a Regionally‑Managed business 
to enhance its agility and to respect local 
preferences. A dedicated Strategic Business 
Unit has been created to retain the strengths of 
Nestlé’s globally‑aligned nutrition strategy. We 
continued the transformation of Zone EMENA, 
establishing regional category leadership teams 
with profit and loss responsibility for our food, 
confectionery and dairy businesses, while 
keeping the fundamental role of the respective 
Nestlé Markets. This model has been successful 
with both Nestlé Purina and Nescafé. All of these 
changes will help to ensure faster execution and  
a closer connection to local business realities.
Board engagement
Our Board of Directors is committed to the 
highest standards of corporate governance. It 
oversees management to ensure the long‑term 
health of our company, so it can continue to 
deliver value over time.
During the year, the Board reconfirmed 
Nestlé’s value creation model, delivering both 
top and bottom‑line growth, as well as capital 
efficiency. It undertook a comprehensive review 
of the company’s capital structure and priorities 
to support and enhance our ability to deliver on 
4
Chairman and CEO. At the same time, it 
rearticulated the company’s purpose and values. 
Our Board’s actions to create sustained value 
included adding four new independent directors 
in the past three years. The Board continued 
its refreshment by selecting strong candidates 
for election. It also expanded the mission of 
our Nomination and Sustainability Committee 
to review all aspects of our non‑financial 
performance and it strengthened risk oversight  
by our Audit Committee.
The Board visited Germany on its annual 
visit to a major market, where it received a 
strategic briefing on the food business. Special 
presentations during the year also included 
Nestlé’s Group strategy, a broader view on 
M&A, a review of consumer trends, our business 
in Zone AOA including China, as well as our 
Nestlé Health Science and Nestlé Skin Health 
businesses. The Board also reviewed the 
company’s shareholder base, its exposure to 
cybersecurity risks, its capital investment strategy 
and capital investment plan, and its annual risk 
and compliance reports.
Active engagement with our shareholders 
and other stakeholders allowed the Board to take 
into account their views on our performance, 
governance and long‑term strategy.
At the 2017 Annual General Meeting, the 
shareholders elected Paul Bulcke as Chairman 
of the Board of Directors, following his 37 years 
of service to Nestlé, including nine years as 
CEO. They further elected Nestlé CEO U. Mark 
Schneider and Ursula M. Burns, Chairman 
of the Board of Xerox Corporation, as new 
members of the Board. The Board thanked 
Peter Brabeck‑Letmathe, who did not stand for 
re‑election, for his almost 50 years of service to 
Nestlé and named him Chairman Emeritus.
There were also changes in the Executive 
Board. Stefan Palzer has been appointed Chief 
Technology Officer as of 1 January 2018.  

--- Page 9 ---
Chief Technology Officer Stefan Catsicas decided 
to pursue entrepreneurial and venture capital 
activities outside of Nestlé. He will continue as 
an advisor in science and technology. Deputy 
Executive Vice President Heiko Schipper decided 
to pursue interests outside the company as of 
31 December 2017. He will not be replaced on the 
Executive Board following the reorganisation of 
the Nutrition business.
Value for shareholders and society
Amid many changes, two important dimensions 
do not change – our purpose and our values. 
Our purpose is to enhance quality of life and 
contribute to a healthier future. Our values, rooted 
in respect, guide our decisions and actions. 
We believe that business can have a positive 
impact on society. By doing so, we create shared 
value. This ensures the long‑term success 
of our business and continued value for our 
shareholders, while also contributing to society.
Since 2013, Nestlé has been actively involved 
in supporting young people through initiatives like 
Nestlé Needs YOUth. We firmly believe that young 
people are our future. They will be our leaders, 
employees, suppliers and farmers. In 2017, we 
extended our Nestlé needs YOUth initiative globally 
to encompass our entire value chain and set out 
an ambition to help 10 million young people have 
access to economic opportunities by 2030.
In recognition of our work in contributing to 
the United Nations Sustainable Development 
Goals (SDGs) through our Creating Shared 
Value approach, Nestlé received the Concordia 
Leadership Award. We have also renewed 
our commitment to the UN Global Compact. 
It promotes the principle of public‑private 
collaborations in support of the SDGs. These 
efforts, among others, show that business has 
a vital role to play in building a better, more 
sustainable world for everyone.
2017 was an exciting year – one of both 
continuity and change. Continuity in building on 
the strong Nutrition, Health and Wellness strategy 
of our company; change to increase our speed 
and efficiency, and to simplify the way we work. 
Nestlé has the people and the leadership across 
the globe to guide the company through these 
changes and ensure our long‑term success.
We want to thank our 323 000 employees for 
their ongoing dedication to Nestlé. It is their hard 
work and commitment to excellence that drives 
our company day to day.
We thank you, our shareholders, for your 
continuing support. We value your ongoing 
trust in our company and our people, and your 
confidence in our leadership setting a solid,  
stable course for the future. Nestlé has a  
strong foundation, a clear path forward and  
a bright future.

Our strategy
Through enhancing quality of life and contributing to a healthier future, 
we aim to deliver sustainable, industry‑leading financial performance and 
earn trust. For over 150 years, we have built a successful business through 
understanding and anticipating consumer needs, and adapting to succeed 
in an evolving marketplace. Based on a compelling strategy, our company 
delivers dependable value over the short term and long term.

Nestlé has many enduring strengths that keep 
us at the top of our industry. We have great 
brands that people love. We have a unique global 
footprint, a size and scale that we use to our 
advantage, and the capacity to invest for the long 
term. In 2017, we reconfirmed our value creation 
model. Through the right balance of sustainable 
growth and efficiency, as well as capital 
efficiency, we will continue to create long‑term 
value for our shareholders and for society as  
a whole.
Building on our Nutrition,  
Health and Wellness strategy
Nestlé’s success is built on its Nutrition, Health 
and Wellness strategy. Our founder, Henri Nestlé, 
believed that good nutrition was the key to a 
healthy life. Today, food and beverages remain 
core to our strategy. Our aim is to provide the 
tastiest and healthiest choices, at all times of 
the day and for all stages of life, delivered in a 
convenient and time‑saving manner. We also 
offer consumer healthcare products to help 
people meet their health and wellness goals.  
This is what we mean by ‘Good food, Good life’.
Understanding and serving the consumer
Nestlé’s portfolio is well‑positioned for growth. 
The key to our long‑term success continues  
to be understanding and serving the consumer.  
By identifying consumer trends early and  
acting quickly to capture them, we remain at  
the forefront of the fast‑moving consumer  
goods industry.
People today know the importance of good 
nutrition and of managing their health more 
proactively. They want products with simple, 
understandable ingredients, natural or organic, 
and ideally locally produced. Likewise, many 
people do not have the time to prepare and cook 
meals, so they are looking for food and beverages 
that are convenient too.
Nestlé has the largest research and 
development network in the food and beverages 
industry, continually innovating and renovating 
our portfolio to meet changing consumer 
demands. We also work with leading‑edge 
partners around the world, including start‑ups, 
academic institutions and public organisations. 
They help strengthen our own capabilities by 
generating ideas, accessing skills and developing 
new technologies, so we can remain at the 
forefront of consumer trends.
We are focusing on products with nutrition, 
health and wellness benefits. This includes 
delivering products with simpler ingredients, 
as well as more premium, organic, natural and 
fortified foods and beverages. Nestlé also offers a 
range of affordably‑priced, high‑quality, nutritious 
products. Many of our foods and beverages, 
especially those for children, include added 
micronutrients such as iron, iodine, vitamin A  
and zinc to support good health and well‑being.

Increasing efficiency
Nestlé is committed to margin expansion. We 
have set an underlying trading operating profit 
margin target of 17.5% to 18.5% by 2020, up  
from 16% in 2016.
Our primary driver is to reduce structural costs 
in non‑consumer facing areas. Well‑identified 
projects in manufacturing, procurement and 
general administration are expected to deliver 
total savings of CHF 2.0 to 2.5 billion by 2020.
We are optimising our manufacturing 
footprint and increasing efficiency throughout 
our operations. This will both increase our 
capacity utilisation and reduce our conversion 
costs. Through global procurement, we leverage 
Nestlé’s purchasing power worldwide. We are 
supporting our centralised purchasing activities 
by establishing global procurement hubs.
Scaling up the use of shared services brings 
further efficiency. We aim to increase the 
availability and use of shared services to 50%  
by 2020.
Enhanced local and regional decision‑making 
allows us to move more quickly in the market. 
Furthermore, we are reviewing and consolidating 
our real estate portfolio, and we have outsourced 
the management of the Nestlé pension fund.
Our strategy
Accelerating growth
At Nestlé, we believe that long‑term value 
creation is the result of both growth and operating 
efficiency. We achieve sustainable top‑line growth 
by investing selectively in high‑growth categories 
and geographies. The target, set in 2017, is 
mid‑single digit organic growth by 2020. We aim 
to achieve this by refocusing our base businesses, 
active portfolio management and prudent 
investment behind our high‑growth categories.
We are managing our coffee, petcare, infant 
nutrition and bottled water categories with an 
emphasis on growth. Nestlé has a significant global 
market share in these categories. We have some 
of the world’s leading brands, including Nescafé, 
Purina, Gerber and Nestlé Pure Life. Furthermore, we 
have science and technology‑based competitive 
advantages across these categories. Nestlé is 
also pursuing growth opportunities in consumer 
healthcare to complement our focus on these key 
food and beverages categories. As a result, we 
are expanding our presence across the pharmacy 
channels in both emerging and developed markets.
The core of value creation comes from 
product, service and business model innovation. 
Strength in research and development is a key 
differentiator for Nestlé, helping us to respond 
quickly to the ever‑changing world. Our 
innovation is broad‑based across all categories, 
from product renovations to service delivery 
platforms. It starts with transforming our core 
portfolio to keep products, brands and services 
relevant, as well as creating and scaling new 
brands where needed.
Digital innovation presents us with further 
opportunities for competitive advantage in 
developing more personalised experiences and 
new delivery methods. We are connecting with 
younger consumers in the digital space, using 
both local and specialised platforms. We are fully 
committed to digital marketing and e‑commerce 
platforms as avenues for growth. Hence, we are 
expanding these new business models, focusing 
strongly on our direct‑to‑consumer models, as 
well as partnering with key online retailers around 
the world.

Creating Shared Value
Creating Shared Value (CSV) is the fundamental  
principle of how Nestlé does business. It is our  
way of creating value for both shareholders and  
for society at the same time.
We understand that the prospects of our  
business are linked to the health and resilience  
of the society and world in which we operate.  
Our priorities are those areas with the greatest  
connection between Nestlé’s business and society.
Our 41 public commitments bring to life our  
purpose of enhancing quality of life and contributing 
to a healthier future. These commitments  
contribute to the UN’s Sustainable Development  
Goals. The details of our progress against them  
are published in this Annual Review.
Allocating capital prudently
Nestlé has a strong portfolio, with profitable 
growth platforms and leading market positions in 
many categories. We take a prudent and focused 
approach to capital allocation to ensure solid 
long‑term growth.
We constantly review our brand portfolio and 
are selective in evaluating merger and acquisition 
opportunities. We will make acquisitions  
in fast‑growing categories only if they are 
complementary to our existing portfolio,  
deliver the attractive returns our shareholders 
expect and are in line with our Nutrition, Health 
and Wellness strategy.
Nestlé regularly revisits its capital structure to 
reflect changing market conditions and strategic 
priorities. Our financial strategy aims at striking 
the right balance between growth in earnings per 
share, competitive shareholder returns, flexibility 
for external growth and access to financial markets.
In June 2017, we announced a new 
CHF 20 billion share buyback programme to  
be completed by the end of June 2020. Should 
any sizeable acquisitions take place during this 
period, the share buyback programme will be 
adapted accordingly.
We increasingly focus capital spending on 
advancing our high‑growth food and beverages 
categories. We are also building on our strong 
position in emerging markets and pursuing 
growth opportunities in consumer healthcare. 
We are taking actions to drive long‑term growth 
through a mix shift towards higher‑margin and 
high‑growth categories, and an unmatched 
dedication to research and development.

Innovating for a changing world
At Nestlé, continuous innovation is part of our DNA. Our success is 
founded on over 150 years of anticipating trends and understanding 
consumers’ needs. This approach remains fundamental to our strategy. 
Nestlé has the most advanced science and innovation network in the  
food and beverages industry. This enables us to translate our knowledge 
into highly‑relevant products and services for our consumers.
10

--- Page 15 ---
Our understanding of the relationship between 
nutrition and health is continually evolving. 
Nestlé’s researchers are looking ahead to discover 
how we can further enhance quality of life and 
contribute to a healthier future. At our different 
sites across the world, including the Nestlé 
Research Centre and the Nestlé Institute of Health 
Sciences, we are working to discover, develop 
and deploy new products and services that we 
aim to scale up rapidly.
To augment our own capabilities, we also 
collaborate with leading universities, research 
organisations and start‑ups. Likewise, we 
have a number of innovation partnerships 
with ingredient suppliers and equipment 
manufacturing companies to accelerate product 
and technology development.
Creating tastier and healthier products
We are constantly looking for ways to improve the 
nutritional profile and taste of our products. Our 
scientific and technological solutions are inspired 
by nature.
structured sugar, and are delivering the first 
confectionery product containing it in 2018.
Enhancing infant and maternal nutrition
Through our research, we know that metabolism 
and, to some extent, taste preferences are 
programmed at an early age. We also know 
that these dietary preferences and patterns can 
have an impact on health for years to come. 
So, providing optimal nutrition for infants and 
young children in the first 1000 days of life – from 
conception to their second birthday – is crucial.
Our focus on the first 1000 days also includes 
understanding the nutritional needs of mothers 
from conception of a child to breastfeeding. 
Maternal nutrition is one of our main research 
areas today. To this end, we are working in 
partnership with a number of universities around 
the world. In one of the largest public‑private 
partnerships of its kind, we are looking at the 
impact of nutrition and lifestyle on maternal and 
infant health in collaboration with the EpiGen 
Global Research Consortium.
In 2017, over 60% of our R&D budget was 
Food sensitivity and allergies in infants is 
dedicated to developing more nutritious products. 
For our food and beverages categories, the 
focus remains on developing tastier and 
healthier offerings. We also continue to deliver 
specific health benefits through our products in 
categories like infant nutrition and health science.
Using food material science, we can increase 
the sensorial impact of the ingredients we use. 
For example, our research shows that parts of 
the ingredients that deliver taste are not fully 
released or dissolved during eating. Hence, they 
are not interacting with the taste buds. Applying 
our knowledge, we can increase the amount that 
dissolves in the mouth. This allows us to reduce 
the amount of the ingredient, while keeping the 
same perceived taste, and make new products 
that taste good and use fewer ingredients like 
sugar, salt and fat.
Our groundbreaking work in sugar reduction 
is an example of this. By structuring sugar 
differently, we were able to make it dissolve 
in the mouth quicker. This means we can use 
significantly less sugar in our confectionery 
products, while ensuring the same great taste. 
We have scaled up the production of this new 
another key area of research. A number of babies 
and children suffer from cow’s milk protein 
allergy. To help their parents and doctors to 
better manage their dietary needs, Nestlé Health 
Science has developed a range of nutritional 
solutions (Althéra, Alfaré, Alfamino). It has also 
developed tools that enable early and accurate 
diagnosis of the allergy.
Breast milk is the ideal nutrition for babies. For 
babies that cannot be breastfed, we continue to 
deepen our understanding of the composition of 
breast milk. Our mission is to innovate and offer 
the next best alternative.
Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) are 
the third most abundant component of breast 
milk. They play a key role in an infant’s healthy 
development and well‑being, supporting the 
baby’s immune system and promoting healthy 
gut microbiota. We are the first company to 
produce two varieties of HMOs on an industrial 
scale for our NAN infant formula range.
Understanding the microbiome

gastrointestinal tract are known as the ‘human

7   REPORT OF THE SUPERVISORY BOARD
Dear Shareholders and Shareholder Representatives,
Back in 2007, the BMW Group set a new strategic course with the adoption of its strategy “Number ONE”. 
Today, we can look back on the fifth successive year in which we have achieved record figures. Responsible 
management involves anticipating new developments and initiating the next moves in good time to ensure 
the future success of the business. This forward-looking approach applies equally to the Supervisory Board. 
By taking the step of announcing Harald Krüger’s future appointment to the position of Chairman of the 
Board of Management at an early stage and implementing other decisions with respect to the board’s com-
position, the resolutions adopted by the Supervisory Board in 2014 have set a clear-cut course for the future 
leadership of the BMW Group. At the same stage, we also announced our plan to ring in a change at the 
head of the Supervisory Board in 2015 by declaring our unanimous support in favour of the appointment of 
Dr Norbert Reithofer as its new Chairman. With the backing of major shareholders, we intend to propose 
his election to the Supervisory Board at the Annual General Meeting. These proposed changes in leadership 
have been initiated in order to strengthen the position of the BMW Group by ensuring a long-term manage-
ment perspective.
Main emphases of the Supervisory Board’s monitoring and advisory activities  The Supervisory Board 
again advised the Board of Management during the past financial year and carefully monitored its governance 
of the business. Our work, both within the Supervisory Board and together with the Board of Management, 
was constructive and characterised by open, trustful interaction.
In a total of five Supervisory Board meetings, we deliberated on the current situation of the BMW Group 
as well as on macroeconomic developments in its most important sales markets. Additional key points of 
 debate at our meetings were Group corporate strategy and planning. Furthermore, we developed concepts 
for a generational change at the chair level of both the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board, took 
decisions regarding the composition and compensation of the Board of Management and passed resolutions 
with respect to corporate governance.
We carefully monitored the performance of the BMW Group, both at scheduled meetings and at other times 
as the need arose. In particular, the Board of Management kept us well informed of all key sales and workforce 
figures. The Chairman of the Board of Management, Dr Norbert Reithofer, informed me promptly and di-
rectly about major business transactions and projects. In addition to scheduled meetings, Dr Karl-Ludwig Kley, 
the Chairman of the Supervisory Board’s Audit Committee, and Dr Friedrich Eichiner, member of the Board 
of Management responsible for Finance, consulted with each other directly at other times as the need arose.
At the beginning of the year, the Board of Management presented us with a summary of new and revised 
models scheduled for market launch over the course of 2014.
In its regular reports on the financial condition of the Group, the Board of Management informed us of 
sales volume developments and market competition issues relevant for the Automotive and Motorcycles 
segments and highlighted fluctuations in the size of the workforce. Equally, we were kept up to date with 
 respect to the market developments and economic prospects of the world’s key regions. On the Financial 
Services side of the business, the Board of Management provided us with regular updates on new business 
with retail customers, changes in the portfolio of contracts with dealerships and retail customers as well as 
the total volume of business.
The Board of Management also reported to us on its intention to increase the size of the Group’s produc-
tion network, with particular regard to the planned expansion of the Spartanburg plant in South Carolina, 
USA, and the search for a new plant location in the NAFTA region, which is now due to be built in San Luis 
Potosí, Mexico. As part of this process, we also discussed with the Board of Management the general sig-
nificance and scope of the “production follows the market” principle in the context of the global distribution 
of value added along the production chain.

Furthermore, both in business status reports and subsequent discussions with the Board of Management, 
numerous important current events and projects were addressed, such as the extension of the cooperation 
agreement with the Chinese joint venture partner Brilliance, the cooperation with Toyota and the current 
state of plans for the long-term development of production facilities in Russia. Other topics reported on and 
discussed at Supervisory Board meetings included the start-up of the new MINI at the Oxford plant, the 
current situation with recalls and the economic impact of the Ukraine conflict.
One Supervisory Board meeting was held in Shenyang, one of the locations operated by the BMW Brilliance 
Automotive Ltd. (BBA) joint venture in China. Representatives of the managements of BBA and the BMW 
sales company reported to us on sales volume trends and the car market in China in general as well as plans 
for additionally increasing production capacity in the plants located at Tiexi and Dadong in Shenyang. We 
also visited the production facilities of the Tiexi plant. Moreover, in the course of our on-site visits we gathered 
 useful facts regarding cooperation with suppliers and dealerships in China. Reports from, and discussions 
with, local management representatives provided us with a useful overview of local developments in China 
and individual development projects, and helped provide a good insight into the specific needs of Chinese 
customers.
One two-day meeting of the Supervisory Board dealt with the BMW Group’s corporate and product 
strategies as well as the Long-term Business Forecast. The format of the two-day meeting was designed to 
provide the opportunity for an in-depth discussion with the Board of Management on forward-looking 
 topics and technical innovations.
In the first part of the meeting, together with the Board of Management we discussed the results of the 
corporate strategy Number ONE review, which is performed by the Board of Management once a year. Our 
discussions primarily focused on challenges involving further reductions in carbon emissions and also the 
electrification, digitisation and, in particular, the increasing connectedness of vehicle data. As part of its strategy 
review report, the Board of Management also looked at the importance of the “Future Retail” programme, 
which is designed to improve sales and after-sales services by consistently seeing things from the point of view 
of customers and intensifying their product and brand experience.
In the course of various vehicle presentations, we were given the opportunity to test selected BMW, MINI 
and Rolls-Royce brand cars on a test track. In addition, the current state of progress of selected vehicle de-
velopment projects was presented and explained to us.
In the second part of the meeting we deliberated at length on the Long-term Business Forecast pre-
sented by the Board of Management for the years 2015 – 2020. After diligent examination, we approved 
the forecast.
We also gave in-depth consideration to the business development, strategic direction and role of the Finan-
cial Services segment going into the future. The Board of Management also reported on the latest develop-
ments on used car markets and explained individual measures designed to further improve the stability of 
the segment in times of crisis.
The two boards jointly discussed the annual budget put forward by the Board of Management towards the 
end of the year under report for the financial year 2015, and considered pertinent external factors.
The structure and amount of compensation of Board of Management members was examined once again in 
2014 by both the Personnel Committee and the full Supervisory Board. In addition to comparing performance 
trends and board compensation on a multi-year basis, we also reviewed he development of the remuneration 
of senior management and employees of BMW AG within Germany over the course of time. An external

compensation consultant, independent of both the Board of Management and BMW AG, was called upon to 
provide expert advice and assist us in evaluating DAX compensation studies. After a careful review, we con-
cluded that the compensation of board members is appropriate and that the current compensation system 
is functioning well. Further information on the compensation of Board of Management members is provided 
in the Compensation Report (see chapter Statement on Corporate Governance).
Corporate governance  The Supervisory Board and the Board of Management again jointly addressed the 
topic of corporate governance within the BMW Group in 2014. In the most recent Declaration of Compliance, 
issued in December 2014, the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board declared that the BMW 
Group has and will continue to comply with all of the recommendations of the German Government Cor-
porate Governance Code Commission published on 30 September 2014 (Code version; 24 June 2014), with 
one exception, which relates to the presentation of information concerning Board of Management compensa-
tion using stipulated model tables. We remain committed to providing information on board compensation 
that is both as comprehensive and comprehensible as possible, taking into account all relevant financial 
 reporting requirements. After careful consideration, we came to the conclusion that the additional use of the 
tables recommended in the Code would not improve the desired level of transparency and readability of 
the Compensation Report.
As part of the joint examination of corporate governance within the BMW Group, the Board of Manage-
ment informed both the Personnel Committee and the full Supervisory Board on the status of implementa-
tion of the BMW Group’s diversity concept. This programme does not only focus on gender, it is also aimed 
at promoting diversity in other areas, particularly in terms of cultural diversity and age mix within the work-
force. We were also informed with respect to the proportion and number of women occupying positions 
at various levels of management and deliberated with the Board of Management on the planned measures to 
continue the process of raising that proportion, specifically at a senior level. Consideration was also given to 
draft legislation relating to equal participation of women and men in management positions in Germany and 
the potential impact of this legislation on the BMW Group.
With regard to its own composition, based on a detailed composition profile, the Supervisory Board has 
decided upon specific appointment targets, which are discussed in detail in the Corporate Governance Report. 
Based on a self-assessment, the Supervisory Board concluded that its composition at 31 December 2014 
meets the targets set.
BMW AG has entered into contracts for personnel-related services with an external entity, in which mem-
bers of the Supervisory Board have an indirect participation. During the year under report, the Personnel 
Committee approved an amendment to these contracts as a precautionary measure. None of the members of 
the Supervisory Board with an interest in the relevant entity participated in this vote. Apart from this one 
matter, there were no indications of potential conflicts of interest involving Supervisory Board members during 
the financial year 2014.
Supervisory Board members are required to provide information on a quarterly basis of any significant 
transactions they or other related parties (as defined by IAS 24), including close relatives and intermediary 
entities, have with BMW Group entities.
We are fully committed to assessing and continuously improving the efficiency of the work of the Super-
visory Board and its committees. The Chairman of the Audit Committee and myself are therefore always 
glad to receive comments and suggestions for improvement from Supervisory Board members. The formal 
examination of the Supervisory Board’s efficiency is also treated each year as a separate agenda point 
for discussion, without the members of the Board of Management being present. The efficiency examination 

--- Page 10 ---

in 2014, again prepared with the aid of a questionnaire, resulted in a number of suggestions being accepted 
for additional consideration.
Each of the five Supervisory Board meetings in 2014 was attended, on average, by over 95 % of its mem-
bers, a fact that can be tied in to the analysis of attendance fees for individual members, as disclosed in the 
Compensation Report. No member of the Supervisory Board was absent at more than two meetings during 
the period under report. Presiding Board and committee meetings were fully attended in the vast majority of 
cases (see chapter Statement on Corporate Governance).
Description of Presiding Board activities and committee work  In order to work more efficiently and 
prepare complex issues and decisions with greater thoroughness, the Supervisory Board has established 
a Presiding Board and several committees. A description of the duties, composition and work procedures of 
these committees is provided in the Corporate Governance Report.
The relevant chairmen reported in depth on the status of Presiding Board and committee work at the 
subsequent Supervisory Board meeting.
In a total of four meetings, the Presiding Board focused mainly on preparing topics for the meetings of 
the full Supervisory Board, unless this responsibility fell under the remit of one of the committees. Complex 
issues, such as the Long-term Business Forecast and the Annual Strategic Review, were dealt with on the 
 basis of written and oral reports provided by Board of Management members and senior department heads. 
The Presiding Board selected further topics of discussion for Supervisory Board meetings and made sugges-
tions to the Board of Management regarding items to be included in its reports to the full Supervisory Board.
The Audit Committee held four meetings and three telephone conference calls during 2014. Prior to their 
publication, the Interim Financial Reports were discussed with the Board of Management in those telephone 
conference calls. Representatives of the external auditors took part in the telephone conference call held to 
present the Interim Financial Report for the six-month period ended 30 June 2014. The report had been sub-
jected to review by the external auditors.
The Audit Committee meeting held in spring 2014 was primarily dedicated to preparing the Supervisory 
Board meeting at which the financial statements were examined. Prior to proposing KPMG AG Wirtschafts-
prüfungsgesellschaft for election as Company and Group auditor at the 2014 Audit Committee Meeting, we 
obtained a Declaration of Independence from KPMG. The Audit Committee also considered the scope and 
composition of non-audit-related services, including tax advisory services provided by KPMG entities to the 
BMW Group. There were no indications of conflicts of interest, grounds for exclusion or lack of independence 
on the part of the auditor.
The fee proposals for the audit of the year-end Company and Group Financial Statements 2014 and 
the review of the six-month Interim Financial Report were deemed appropriate by the Audit Committee. 
Subsequent to the Annual General Meeting 2014, the Audit Committee therefore appointed KPMG AG 
Wirtschafts prüfungsgesellschaft for the relevant engagements and, with due consideration to the sugges-
tions made by the full Supervisory Board, specified a number of audit focus areas.
The Head of Group Controlling reported to the Audit Committee on risk management processes within 
the BMW Group, provided information with respect to new developments and elucidated a number of risks 
which are required to be reported on in accordance with internal rules.
The Head of Group Financial Reporting provided the Audit Committee with an up-to-date overview of 
developments concerning the internal control system (ICS), which serves as the basis for financial reporting. 

--- Page 11 ---
11   REPORT OF THE SUPERVISORY BOARD
Testing performed during the year under report did not highlight any material ICS weaknesses which could 
jeopardise the system’s effectiveness.
The Chairman of the BMW Group Compliance Committee reported to the Audit Committee on the con-
cept that has been developed to strengthen local compliance functions as well as on the current compliance 
situation, which, as in the previous year, was deemed satisfactory overall. None of the information received 
relating to potential non-compliance or actual incidences of non-compliance identified in specific cases gave 
any indication of serious or systemic non-compliance with applicable requirements.
The Head of Group Internal Audit reported to us in the Audit Committee on the organisation of the Group 
Internal Audit as the BMW Group’s “Third Line of Defence”, informed us of the significant findings of audits 
conducted by Group Internal Audit, on both the industrial and financial services sides of the business, and 
explained the main points of emphasis for planned audits.
We concurred in the Audit Committee with the decision of the Board of Management to raise the Com-
pany’s share capital in accordance with § 4 (5) of the Articles of Incorporation (Authorised Capital 2014) by 
€ 239,757 and to issue a corresponding number of new non-voting bearer shares of preferred stock, each with 
a par value of € 1, at favourable conditions to employees.
The Personnel Committee convened six times during the financial year 2014. One major area of deliberation 
was the future composition of the Board of Management, with particular regard to preparing for successor 
decisions, including consideration of possible scenarios for the future change in the chair of the Board of 
Management.
In preparation for the full Supervisory Board’s meetings, the Personnel Committee reviewed the structure 
and appropriateness of Board of Management compensation and prepared the Supervisory Board’s decision 
with respect to board members’ bonuses. In two cases we also gave our approval for one member of the 
Board of Management to accept the mandate for membership of the supervisory board of a non-BMW Group 
entity.
The Nomination Committee convened twice during the financial year 2014. At these meetings, we deliber-
ated on successor planning for mandates of the shareholders’ representatives on the Supervisory Board and 
considered proposals for candidates for the Supervisory Board elections at the Annual General Meeting 2015, 
taking the composition objectives stipulated for the Supervisory Board into due account.
The statutory Mediation Committee was not required to convene during the financial year 2014.
Generational change at head of Board of Management and Supervisory Board initiated  The Supervisory 
Board worked through a number of scenarios with respect to succession planning at the head of the Super-
visory Board and – together with the Chairman of the Board of Management, Dr Norbert Reithofer – assessed 
the range of options available for selecting a new Chairman of the Board of Management. Various constella-
tions were examined, including the important issue of timing. We wanted to bring about a farsighted, timely 
change in leadership in order to strengthen the position of the BMW Group with a long-term perspective 
for management. We shared the opinion of major shareholders that Dr Reithofer’s wealth of knowledge and 
experience should be retained within the BMW Group and that the Supervisory Board would benefit greatly 
from his playing a key role in its work.
The Supervisory Board therefore supports the proposal that Dr Norbert Reithofer be appointed to the 
position of Chairman of the Supervisory Board – subject to his election to that board. After carefully con­
sidering various scenarios, the conclusion was reached that a direct move by Dr Reithofer to the position of 

--- Page 12 ---
12
Chairman of the Supervisory Board – without an interim phase – will strengthen the role of the Supervisory 
Board and is thus in the best interests of the BMW Group.
In order to ensure that this generational change can also take place in good time at the head of the Super-
visory Board, in agreement with its other members, I have resigned my mandate as Supervisory Board 
member with  effect from the end of the Annual General Meeting 2015.
In due consideration of these developments, the Supervisory Board has reached agreement with 
Dr Reithofer concerning the early termination of his Board of Management mandate and his service con-
tract with effect from the end of the Annual General Meeting 2015.
Harald Krüger has been appointed Chairman of the Board of Management with effect from the end of the 
Annual General Meeting 2015, to coincide with Dr Reithofer’s planned exit from the Board of Management. 
Harald Krüger brings a great deal of experience to this position from his previous board responsibilities. Since 
2013, he has been in charge of Production, before which, from 2008 to 2012, he was first responsible for Human 
Resources and then for the MINI, BMW Motorrad, Rolls-Royce and BMW Group Aftersales division.
Other changes in the composition and organisational structure of the Board of Management  Klaus 
Fröhlich, previously Head of Small and Mid-size Series BMW Group, was appointed as member of the Board 
of Management with effect from 9 December 2014, with responsibility for Development. His predecessor, 
Dr Herbert Diess, resigned from the Board of Management on 9 December 2014.
With effect from the end of the Annual General Meeting 2015, the Supervisory Board appointed 
 Oliver Zipse, most recently Head of Corporate Planning and Product Strategy, as a member of the Board of 
Management. He  will take over responsibility for Production from Harald Krüger.
The Supervisory Board also renewed the appointment of three Board of Management members in 2014.
Other personnel changes in the Supervisory Board  In accordance with the regulations of the Co-Deter-
mination Act, the ten employee representatives were re-elected with effect from the end of the Annual 
General Meeting on 15 May 2014. 
After 10 years of valuable and highly appreciated work in the Supervisory Board, Bertin Eichler did not 
stand for re-election. In his place, Christiane Benner (Executive Board member of IG Metall) was newly 
elected to the Supervisory Board as union representative. As a result, the Supervisory Board now has five 
 female members (25%). Ulrich Kranz, Head of the BMW i product line, was newly elected to the Super visory 
Board to succeed Dr Markus Schramm as executive staff representative. The Supervisory Board thanked 
the members leaving office for their constructive work and trusting cooperation within the Super visory 
Board. The composition of the Presiding Board and the committees remained unchanged in 2014, with all 
previous members confirmed in their respective functions. The Corporate Governance Report includes an 
overview of the composition of the Supervisory Board and its committees (see chapter Statement on Corpo-
rate Governance).
Wolfgang Mayrhuber has resigned his mandate as member of the Supervisory Board with effect from 
the end of the Annual General Meeting 2015. We also wish to extend our thanks to him for more than 
ten years of valuable and highly appreciated service in the Supervisory Board, always working in the best 
 interest of the Group.
Examination of financial statements and the profit distribution proposal  KPMG AG Wirtschafts-
prüfungsgesellschaft conducted a review of the abridged Interim Group Financial Statements and Interim 
Group Management Report for the six-month period ended 30 June 2014. The results of the review were 
presented to the Audit Committee by KPMG representatives. No issues were identified that might indicate 

--- Page 13 ---
13   REPORT OF THE SUPERVISORY BOARD
that the abridged Interim Group Financial Statements and Interim Group Management Report had not been 
prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the applicable provisions.
The Group and Company Financial Statements of Bayerische Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft for the 
year ended 31 December 2014 and the Combined Management Report – as authorised for issue by the Board 
of Management on 19 February 2015 – were audited by KPMG AG Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft and 
given an unqualified audit opinion.
The Financial Statements and the Combined Management Report, the long-form audit reports of the 
external auditors and the Board of Management’s profit distribution proposal were made available to all 
members of the Supervisory Board in a timely manner.
These documents were examined and discussed thoroughly by the Audit Committee at the meeting held 
on 5 March 2015. The Supervisory Board subsequently examined these documents at its meeting on 12 March 
2015, after receiving the committee chairman’s report on the meeting of the Audit Committee. In both 
meetings, the Board of Management gave a detailed explanation of the financial reports it had prepared. 
Representatives of the external auditors attended both meetings, reported on significant findings and an-
swered any additional questions raised by the members of the Supervisory Board. They also confirmed that 
the risk management system put in place by the Board of Management is capable of identifying any events 
or developments that might impair the going-concern status of the Company and that no material weak-
nesses in either the internal control system or the risk management system were found with regard to the 
 financial reporting process. Similarly, they confirmed that they had not identified any facts in the course of 
their audit work that were inconsistent with the contents of the Declaration of Compliance issued jointly by 
the two boards.
Based on thorough examination by the Audit Committee and the full Supervisory Board, we concurred 
with the results of the external audit. In accordance with the conclusion reached after the examination by 
the Audit Committee and Supervisory Board, no objections were raised. The Group and Company Financial 
Statements of Bayerische Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft for the financial year 2014 prepared by the Board 
of Management were approved at the Supervisory Board meeting held on 12 March 2015. The separate finan-
cial statements have therefore been adopted.
The Supervisory Board also examined the proposal of the Board of Management to use the unappropriat-
ed profit to pay an increased dividend of € 2.90 per share of common stock and € 2.92 per share of non-voting 
preferred stock. We consider the proposal appropriate and therefore concur with it.
Expression of appreciation by the Supervisory Board  We wish to express our appreciation to the mem-
bers of the Board of Management and the entire workforce of the BMW Group worldwide for their concerted 
efforts and outstanding contribution to the record result we are able to post for the financial year 2014.

15   STATEMENT OF THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT
Dear Shareholders,
The successes a company has achieved in the past belong to its history. All that matters today is a com-
pany’s future. Forward-looking companies renew themselves of their own initiative. It is crucial for a company 
to question its own actions, explore new directions and consistently implement innovations to benefit its 
customers. Financial strength allows companies to invest in the future – thereby securing long­term success 
and fulfilling responsibilities towards shareholders, associates and other stakeholders.
BMW will reach its 100th year in 2016. We naturally plan to celebrate this important milestone in our 
history. It is a testament to our value-based corporate philosophy, geared towards the long term and shaped 
by independent-minded decisions. But above all else, this centenary compels us to look to the future.
Investors in the BMW Group can look forward to long-term value enhancement, on the basis of healthy, 
organic growth. Our shareholders can rely on us to sustain our profitability. Strong competition, market 
 volatility, political uncertainty, new trends in our environment – all of this is part of our daily business.
We firmly believe that mobility will remain a fundamental human need and a cornerstone of dynamic 
economies. We aim to lead the industry with our ideas in all areas of individual mobility, transporting sheer 
driving pleasure to a new age of sustainable mobility. This is an exciting direction for us – and a profitable 
one for our shareholders who accompany us along this path.
2014 financial year – fifth successive record year for the BMW Group  In the 2014 financial year, the 
company’s successful development since the global financial and economic crisis of 2008 / 2009 continued. 
We had set ourselves ambitious goals in a difficult environment: record sales of over two million vehicles; 
our highest-ever Group profit before tax, with a significant increase year-on-year; and an EBIT margin in our 
target range of eight to ten per cent for the Automotive Segment.
Today, we can say: we delivered on our promises. Group profit before tax climbed 10.3 per cent to 
8.7 billion euros. Net profit increased by 9.2 per cent to more than 5.8 billion euros. The EBIT margin in the 
Automotive Segment stands at 9.6 per cent and therefore at the upper end of our target range.
Strong demand for our premium vehicles is the main factor contributing to record revenues of 80.4 billion 
euros. For the first time, we sold more than two million vehicles worldwide in a single year – 2.118 million 
BMW, MINI and Rolls­Royce vehicles, to be exact – fulfilling a wish for many customers. This represents an 
increase of 7.9 per cent over the previous year and a new sales high for the BMW Group.
With regard to our individual brands, there were new records for BMW, Rolls-Royce and BMW Motorrad. 
More than 1.8 million customers purchased a BMW in 2014. Our MINI brand maintained roughly the same 
high level as the previous year, with a total of 302,000 vehicles sold, despite the model changeover. Our 
MINI plant in Oxford in the UK produced its three-millionth MINI last year. With exactly 4,063 vehicles sold, 
Rolls-Royce remains in strong demand and continues to set the standard for the ultra-luxury class. BMW 
 Motorrad also reported growth, with more than 123,000 deliveries, and once again outperformed the overall 
market. The anniversary model BMW R nineT and the fully electric C evolution proved popular with both 
customers and the automotive press.
The Financial Services segment once again made a solid contribution to the success of the BMW Group.
Impact of Strategy Number ONE reflected in key performance indicators  We laid the foundation for 
this successful development back in 2007 with our Strategy Number ONE. This strategy guides all our busi-
ness activities into 2020 and has already taken the company to a new dimension. We operate at an entirely 
different level of performance today than in 2007.

--- Page 16 ---
16
Customer deliveries climbed more than 40 per cent between the end of 2007 and the end of 2014. Group 
revenues increased by 44 per cent over the same period while pre-tax earnings more than doubled. During 
this time, BMW common shares performed much better than the DAX. Our associates, as well as our share-
holders, benefit from this positive development through our preferred shares programme.
We owe our achievements to our associates worldwide  Our successful business development is driven 
by our 116,324 associates worldwide. Their skills, their performance and their dedication – each in his or her 
own area of responsibility – contribute to the overall success of the company.
Our associates at all 30 BMW Group production sites in 14 countries are our most important success factor. 
We are investing extensively in vocational and professional training to qualify them for new demands and 
technologies, such as digitalisation. Between 2007 and the end of 2014 alone, we channelled around 1.8 billion 
euros into vocational and professional training – more than in our Efficient Dynamics technology package. 
People and technology have the same importance for us.
The younger generation ensures our future success: more than 1,500 apprentices worldwide embarked 
on a career with us in September 2014; 1,200 of them in Germany. A total of 4,595 young people are currently 
in vocational training with the BMW Group. This represents an increase of 150 over the previous year.
I would therefore like to thank all our associates on behalf of the Board of Management. I would also like 
to thank all our business partners, and especially our suppliers, who play such a key part in our success. 
And, of course, our thanks also extend to our entire retail organisation and the dealers who are our link to 
the customer.
Customers have the choice: sheer driving pleasure also available with electric and hybrid drivetrains   
The new BMW i family has further strengthened our image as the industry’s leading innovator. 2014 was the 
first year of availability for the pure electric BMW i3. More than 16,000 customers chose this model, which 
was specially designed for urban areas. The BMW i8 has been available to customers since summer. Orders for 
the BMW i8 plug-in hybrid continue to well exceed the planned number of units for production. A total of 
1,741 BMW i8 vehicles were delivered to customers from June to December.
We also use our know-how and experience with BMW i in series production of our other models. In autumn 
2015, we will release our first plug-in hybrid BMW X model, the BMW X5 xDrive40e, which incorporates the 
technological expertise gained from BMW i. The new BMW 7 Series is also set to become the benchmark for 
lightweight design in its segment through the use of carbon fibre. Over time, all model series will be available 
with electric drive technology. Climate protection policies worldwide will remain challenging and growing 
urbanisation demands new mobility solutions.
We will continue to chart our own course with Efficient Dynamics, hybridisation and electromobility. 
There is no way back. Average emissions for our European fleet currently stand at 130 grams of CO2 per 
kilometre. At the same time, we are focusing on sustainable production and efficient use of resources. Since 
2006, we have reduced average resource consumption per vehicle produced by 45 per cent. Sustainability 
pays dividends – in every respect.
Targeted expansion of our global production network  We continue to aim for a balanced distribution 
of sales between the three main economic regions of the world. This allows us to offset fluctuations in indi-
vidual markets and avoid overdependence on any single region. In 2014, Europe accounted for around 43 per 
cent of sales, Asia 31 per cent and the Americas just under 23 per cent.
The global automobile market continues to expand: from around 62 million new vehicle registrations in 
2007 to more than 80 million in 2014. We see no contradiction between participating in this growth and 
maintaining the desirability of our premium brands. In 2014, we continued to create the conditions necessary 
for strategic expansion of our global production network. In October, the first car rolled off the assembly 
line at our new plant in Araquari, Brazil. This gives us a permanent presence in an important growth region.

Michael L. Corbat
Chief Executive Officer
Dear Fellow Shareholders:
When we look back at 2017 from the vantage point of a few years from 
now, I am confident we will point to it as a year Citi decisively emerged 
from a prolonged period of simplification and restructuring into a new era 
of sustainable client-led growth. 
The growth we are driving today is sustainable, balanced and less exposed 
to predictable and unpredictable risks than in the past. It is not going to 
come from acquiring competitors, entering new territories, or expanding 
into ancillary businesses that don’t fit our strategy. It is going to come from 
serving our consumer and institutional clients with distinction. It is going 
to come from earning and keeping clients’ trust and safeguarding their 
security. And it is going to come from being seen as an indisputably strong 
and stable company that takes as much justifiable pride in the positive 
impacts we have on society as in our financial achievements.
That is the context in which, on Investor 
Day in July 2017 — our first in nine 
years — I reiterated our conviction that 
with our restructuring complete, we 
had crossed an inflection point. From 
2017 forward, the decisions we made 
to focus our franchise, invest in our 
capabilities and improve our client 
experience are bearing fruit in the form 
of a more compelling value proposition, 
accelerating growth and improved 
returns for shareholders. Our overriding 
goal is to combine the positive impact 
of an improving macroeconomic 
environment with even stronger 
business performance to consistently 
deliver higher returns on capital and 
increased return of capital to our 
shareholders through 2020 and beyond.
On an operating basis, our 2017 financial 
results strongly support the strategy 
we presented on Investor Day. Yet as 
a consequence of the passage of tax 
reform legislation in the U.S. in the fourth 
quarter of 2017, we took a one-time, non-
cash charge of $22.6 billion, resulting in 
a net loss on a reporting basis for the 
year of $6.8 billion. Having put that one-
time charge behind us, however, we can 
now focus on the positive impacts of tax 
reform for us and our clients. A lower tax 
rate leads to higher net income, which, 
combined with a multi-billion-dollar 
reduction in our tangible common equity, 
will have a powerful positive impact on 
our returns. We estimate the impact of 
tax reform should drive our Return on 
Tangible Common Equity (ROTCE) up by 
200 basis points or more. On a symbolic 
level, reducing the value of our Deferred 
Tax Assets (DTA) — our remaining 
remnant of the financial crisis — indelibly

marks not just the end of a year, but the 
end of an era.
The solid growth we achieved in our core 
consumer and institutional businesses 
came from a more focused country 
presence in consumer and a more 
selective client base in institutional, 
each of which is roughly half the size it 
was at its peak. We have continued to 
execute on investments to streamline 
our infrastructure and drive further 
growth in targeted areas including our 
Mexico, U.S. Cards, Treasury and Trade 
Solutions, Equities and Investment 
Banking franchises.
In Global Consumer Banking, which 
serves more than 100 million consumer 
clients in 19 markets in three regions 
— Asia, Mexico and the U.S. — total 
revenues were up 4 percent over 2016. 
From a product perspective, Global Retail 
Banking grew loans and assets under 
management as we continued to shrink 
our physical footprint. Global Cards also 
delivered good growth, driven by higher 
loan and purchase sales volumes in all 
three regions.
Our Institutional Clients Group delivered 
an impressive performance, driving total 
revenues up 7 percent. Banking revenues 
were higher across our franchise, from 
our backbone Treasury and Trade 
Solutions to Investment Banking, the 
Private Bank and Corporate Lending. 
In our Markets and Securities Services 
segment, a weaker performance in Fixed 
Income and Equities compared to the 
more robust trading environment in 
2016 was offset by growth in Securities 
Services. Once again we demonstrated 
the value of balance across and within 
our businesses. 
Investor Day 2017
Citi hosted our first Investor Day in nine 
years on July 25. It was an opportunity 
to engage directly with investors and 
share the progress we’ve made as a 
firm, as well as our objectives going 
forward. The core message was that 
we’ve crossed an inflection point as a 
firm. Topics included the momentum 
we’re seeing in our businesses, our 
competitive advantages and the 
confidence we have in our strategy.
Excluding the impact of tax reform, our 
2017 net income of $15.8 billion was 
nearly $1 billion — or 6 percent — higher 
than our 2016 net income. On this basis, 
earnings per share rose to $5.33, up 13 
percent over the prior year, including 
a benefit from share repurchases. We 
also made progress toward the targets 
we introduced on Investor Day. Due 
to strong expense management, we 
delivered a full-year Efficiency Ratio of 
58 percent, a more than 150 basis point 
improvement from 2016. We increased 
our Return on Assets to 84 basis points. 
And we achieved a ROTCE of 8.1 percent, 
including the impact of our DTA. And 
excluding the impact of our disallowed 
DTAs, our ROTCE rose to 9.6 from 9 
percent in 2016, showing progress 
toward the 10 percent target we talked 
about on Investor Day.
With regard to improving the return 
of capital to our shareholders, the 
solid results we achieved on our 
Comprehensive Capital Analysis and 
Review (CCAR) “stress test” again 
enabled the planned return of $19 
billion during the current CCAR cycle. 
That laid the foundation for us to 
reduce our outstanding share count 
by over 200 million and return over 
$17 billion of capital to shareholders 
in 2017 through common share 
repurchases and dividends. We 
announced our intention to return — 
subject to regulatory approval — at 
least an additional $40 billion of 
capital to shareholders over the next 
two 2018 and 2019 CCAR cycles. 
The Federal Reserve and the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corporation found 
no deficiencies or shortcomings in our 
2017 Resolution Plan. Both milestones 
underscored the progress we made in 
2017 toward our longstanding goal of 
being an indisputably strong and  
stable institution.
I would like to put these results in the 
broader context of a mindset shift 
we see as critical to sustaining these 
positive trends and trajectories into 
an uncertain future. We cannot control 
the macroeconomic or interest rate 
environment. But we can and must 
control the impacts our decisions  
and actions have on our clients’ 
experience of their interactions  
and engagements with us.

Letter To Shareholders
We know our clients’ expectations for 
seamless experiences are rising by the 
day. In response to that reality, our 
consumer bank launched three times as 
many digital features in 2017 as we did 
in 2016, driving double-digit growth in 
digital and mobile clients worldwide. 
In our institutional business, Citi’s online 
banking platform CitiDirect BE® was 
ranked # 1 for the twelfth consecutive 
year in the 2017 Greenwich Associates 
Digital Banking Benchmarking study. We 
partnered with Nasdaq on the rollout of 
a pioneering application of blockchain 
and distributed ledger technology 
to facilitate and automate payment 
processing. Our Treasury and Trade 
Solutions business, which provides cash 
management and trade finance services 
to multinational corporations and public 
sector clients worldwide, also launched 
a host of digital offerings designed to 
make our global network, the world’s 
largest money mover, even more of a 
competitive advantage than it is today.
All the innovations we launched, crucial 
to serving clients with distinction, 
would not have stood a chance of 
gaining traction or acceptance with 
clients if they required reassurance that 
our reputation or values were sound. 
Fortunately, the strong foundation 
we have built, based on a culture of 
competence, compliance and control 
precedes us. On a number of occasions 
in 2017, I had an opportunity to reaffirm 
those core values as events transpired  
to make taking a stand not just right  
but necessary. 
On the third day of January, in response 
to a newly-released Executive Order 
on Immigration in the U.S., I wrote to 
my roughly 210,000 Citi colleagues in 
nearly 100 countries where we open our 
doors every day to remind them that our 
diversity is a value not just fundamental 
to our present and future, but — given 
our globality — a real competitive 
advantage for our firm. 
To accelerate progress on this important 
front, I asked at least one of my direct 
reports to co-lead each of our newly-
established Affinity Groups — including 
Pride, Black Heritage, Asian Heritage, 
and Citi Salutes, dedicated to veterans’ 
support — with another senior Citi leader. 
I wrote and said to my colleagues as I 
made that announcement that while 
I know we have more work to do, our 
track record at getting difficult things 
done makes me confident that we will 
get to where we need to go. 
In honor of our 12th annual Global 
Community Day, I joined my colleagues 
to plant trees, organize the library and 
install computers at a primary school 
outside Mexico City. I felt just as much 
pride in the project as I did in the fact 
that I was joining over 100,000 others 
as they revitalized parks, served and 
collected food to those in need, and

in so many other ways volunteered to 
serve our communities.
Our commitment to support the 
communities we serve was sorely tested 
by the devastation wrought by hurricanes 
Harvey and Irma, which in rapid 
succession swept through Texas, Florida 
and the Caribbean. In those and other 
areas impacted by natural disasters in 
2017, including Mexico City, which suffered 
a massive earthquake, and Southeast 
Asia, hit hard by flooding, hundreds of 
our people went to extraordinary lengths 
to support and protect their colleagues, 
clients and communities. Working closely 
with local and global nonprofits, including 
the American Red Cross, in all those 
stricken communities our rapid response 
efforts provided funds, necessities and 
volunteer contributions to those in urgent 
need of relief. My Citi colleagues delivered 
22 tons of food and supplies to colleagues 
and communities across Puerto Rico in 
the wake of the storms. Over a two-week 
period after Irma and Harvey, we further 
supported the Red Cross by enabling it to 
re-route phone calls to specially trained 
agents in our Hagerstown, Maryland call 
center, who assisted 1,800 individuals  
in search of emergency support or  
family members.
The vast human and property losses 
those destructive storms left in their 
wake were powerful reminders of the 
extreme weather many more places 
are experiencing as a result of global 
warming. With extreme weather events 
becoming more common, enhancing 
resiliency is a key objective of our 
efforts to finance vital infrastructure in 
partnership with public sector agencies 
and entities worldwide.

in Pathways is the largest single 
philanthropic commitment in its history.
In conclusion, a word I used more than 
once at our Investor Day to describe 
how I feel about where we are today and 
where we are going is “pride.” The Citi 
of today and tomorrow is a place all our

our clients can be proud to work with. I 
am grateful to you for standing with us. 
Looking back on the decisions we made

made to invest with us, I hope you share 
my conviction and belief that our best 
days and years are to come.

The Goldman Sachs Business Principles
We constantly strive to anticipate 
the rapidly changing needs of our 
clients and to develop new services 
to meet those needs. 
We know that the world of finance will 
not stand still and that complacency  
can lead to extinction.
We regularly receive confidential 
information as part of our normal 
client relationships. 
To breach a confidence or to use 
confidential information improperly or 
carelessly would be unthinkable.
Our business is highly competitive, 
and we aggressively seek to expand 
our client relationships. 
However, we must always be fair 
competitors and must never denigrate 
other firms.
Integrity and honesty are  
at the heart of our business. 
We expect our people to maintain high 
ethical standards in everything they do, 
both in their work for the firm and in 
their personal lives.
Our clients’ interests  
always come first. 
Our experience shows that if we  
serve our clients well, our own  
success will follow.
Our assets are our people,  
capital and reputation. 
If any of these is ever diminished, the 
last is the most difficult to restore. We 
are dedicated to complying fully with 
the letter and spirit of the laws, rules 
and ethical principles that govern us. 
Our continued success depends upon 
unswerving adherence to this standard.
Our goal is to provide superior 
returns to our shareholders. 
Profitability is critical to achieving 
superior returns, building our capital, 
and attracting and keeping our best 
people. Significant employee stock 
ownership aligns the interests of our 
employees and our shareholders. 
We take great pride in the 
professional quality of our work. 
We have an uncompromising 
determination to achieve excellence  
in everything we undertake. Though  
we may be involved in a wide variety 
and heavy volume of activity, we  
would, if it came to a choice, rather  
be best than biggest.
We stress creativity and  
imagination in everything we do. 
While recognizing that the old way may 
still be the best way, we constantly 
strive to find a better solution to a 
client’s problems. We pride ourselves 
on having pioneered many of the 
practices and techniques that have 
become standard in the industry.
We make an unusual effort to  
identify and recruit the very best 
person for every job. 
Although our activities are measured in 
billions of dollars, we select our people 
one by one. In a service business,  
we know that without the best people, 
we cannot be the best firm.
We offer our people the opportunity 
to move ahead more rapidly than is 
possible at most other places. 
Advancement depends on merit and 
we have yet to find the limits to the 
responsibility our best people are able 
to assume. For us to be successful, 
our men and women must reflect the 
diversity of the communities and cultures 
in which we operate. That means 
we must attract, retain and motivate 
people from many backgrounds and 
perspectives. Being diverse is  
not optional; it is what we must be.
We stress teamwork  
in everything we do. 
While individual creativity is always 
encouraged, we have found that team 
effort often produces the best results. 
We have no room for those who put their 
personal interests ahead of the interests 
of the firm and its clients.
The dedication of our people to  
the firm and the intense effort  
they give their jobs are greater  
than one finds in most other 
organizations. 
We think that this is an important  
part of our success.
We consider our size an asset  
that we try hard to preserve. 
We want to be big enough to undertake 
the largest project that any of our clients 
could contemplate, yet small enough to 
maintain the loyalty, the intimacy and the 
esprit de corps that we all treasure and 
that contribute greatly to our success.

Fellow Shareholders:
For much of the last year, the global economy grew in fits 
and starts. In the United States, the economic recovery 
accelerated, evidenced by a steadily improving labor market. 
In Europe, challenges remained pronounced as growth  
was constrained. And in Asia, conditions slowed in both 
China and Japan.
Different countries are clearly at different stages of the 
economic cycle, and the interconnectedness of these 
economies has made the transition to growth somewhat 
extended, choppy and, oftentimes, unpredictable. As a 
result, client activity was uneven across regions and  
asset classes.
CEO confidence improved and merger and acquisition  
(M&A) volumes, in particular, rebounded. However, client 
volumes remained generally lower across our Institutional 
Client Services business. Despite uneven conditions, we  
are pleased to report that Goldman Sachs performed well, 
generating solid results for the year. Our performance 
benefited from the strength of our global client franchise, 
diversity of our largely institutional set of businesses and  
our culture of adaptability.
For 2014, the firm produced net revenues of $34.53 billion 
and net earnings of $8.48 billion, a five percent increase from 
$8.04 billion of net earnings in 2013. Diluted earnings per 
common share were $17.07 compared with $15.46 for 2013. 
Our return on average common shareholders’ equity (ROE) 
was 11.2 percent. Book value per common share increased  
by seven percent during 2014 and has grown from $20.94  
at the end of our first year as a public company in 1999 to 
$163.01, a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 
15 percent over this period. Our capital management in 2014 
reflected a prudent approach as our capital ratios continued 
to improve despite returning $6.5 billion to common 
shareholders through share buybacks and dividends.
In our previous letter to shareholders, we discussed our 
focus on driving returns in a challenging macroeconomic 
environment. At the same time, we emphasized the need  
to protect our ability to provide significant upside to our 
shareholders as the economic cycle turns.
The basis for meeting these goals rests on a strong financial 
profile and a sustained operating discipline. Our capital and 
liquidity levels help ensure stability during periods of market 
stress and position the firm to add value to our clients when 
they need it most. And, generating operating efficiency has 
bolstered our capacity to improve returns consistently, despite 
the lackluster operating environment of recent years.

Letter to Shareholders
Against this backdrop, in this year’s letter, we would like to review our fi nancial 
strength and the benefi ts embedded in our business model. We will also discuss 
our operating strategy in the recent environment and our major businesses with 
a focus on their competitive positions and opportunities for growth. Finally, we 
will update you on our efforts to protect and sustain our culture of client focus 
and teamwork, as well as the important progress being made across our 
corporate engagement initiatives.
Financial Profi le
Since the end of 2007, our balance sheet is down by nearly one-quarter, while 
our common equity is up 85 percent. As a result, gross leverage has been cut 
by more than one-half. Our liquidity is approximately three times higher than the 
end of 2007, representing more than 20 percent of our total balance sheet at 
the end of 2014. And, less liquid level 3 fi nancial assets are down nearly 
40 percent over this period.
As represented in the charts on the right, our balance sheet measures have 
improved across the board. As a result, we have demonstrated our ability to 
meet or exceed the requirements of various regulations, including Basel III 
capital, the supplementary leverage ratio and the liquidity coverage ratio.
The combination of a solid fi nancial foundation and a focused operating strategy 
provides the ability to adapt quickly. Our balance sheet is less than one-half the 
size of the peer average.* And, our total staff level is less than 20 percent of the 
peer average. We are an institutional client fi rm, with a broad range of services. 
Our retail clients are largely high-net-worth individuals, with an average account 
size of more than $40 million. In short, we are not simple, but we are simpler.
Our strong and stable fi nancial footing has given us the wherewithal to stay 
committed to our core set of businesses over the cycle. We work with tens 
of thousands of companies, institutions, investing entities, governments and 
high-net-worth individuals around the world.
Partly because we have remained focused on executing our strategy through 
our core businesses, we have grown our client franchise over the last several 
years. Institutional Client Services, for example, has seen an approximately 
10 percent increase in active clients since 2010.
Our mix of businesses refl ects the diverse needs of our clients. And, the 
products and services we provide produce a diverse and balanced 
revenue stream.
In addition to better revenue stability, we have benefi ted from a variable cost 
structure. We have long had a “pay for performance” culture. The bottom chart 
depicts the strong correlation between the fi rm’s performance and its levels of 
compensation and benefi ts expense.
To us, this graph underscores the value of a true partnership culture. Culture is 
not preordained or guaranteed in perpetuity. Since we became a public company, 
we have invested an enormous amount of time and resources to sustain our 
* U.S. peers include BAC, C, JPM and MS.

culture. Rigorous partner selection and aligning 
compensation with long-term performance reinforce  
an ethos of long-term ownership.
The combination of a diverse set of businesses,  
effective risk management and a “pay for performance” 
culture has produced a track record of lower earnings 
volatility than our peers. From 2005 through 2014,  
Goldman Sachs’ net earnings to common volatility  
averaged roughly 50 percent vs. 130 percent for peers.
Our relative earnings stability is critical to our ability to 
outperform throughout the cycle. We performed when 
conditions were challenged and we also performed when 
the environment was more favorable.
Against the backdrop of relatively consistent revenues,  
we have performed well across several key metrics.
Compared to 2012, earnings per share is 21 percent higher, 
book value per share is 13 percent higher and our common 
stock dividends per share have grown 27 percent. Over this 
three-year period, we have returned $16 billion via share 
repurchases, while maintaining stronger capital ratios.
Net revenues were roughly flat over the past three years. 
But, that’s not the story. Since 2012, we undertook several 
strategic initiatives to respond to new regulations, including 
higher capital requirements. We sold a majority stake  
in both our Americas reinsurance business and our European 
insurance business — and we liquidated our investment  
in the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China. We also  
sold our hedge fund administration business and our 
REDI platform.
In 2012, these businesses and investments produced 
$2.3 billion in net revenues. So, on a “like-for-like” basis,  
net revenues in 2014 were about $2.7 billion higher than 
2012. Investment Management and Investment Banking 
contributed $2.4 billion to this growth.
We have grown revenues while managing expenses and 
capital. Our average compensation and benefits to net 
revenues ratio from 2009 through 2014 was more than  
900 basis points lower than it was from 2000 through  
2007, despite a tougher revenue environment.
We have been equally focused on capital efficiency. We  
have developed technology to help inform our capital 
allocation decisions. The combination of our profitability and 
risk management allowed us to pay out roughly 70 percent 
of our net earnings to common shareholders since the 
beginning of 2009 and basic share count has declined by  
17 percent since the end of that year. Since the end of 1999, 
our basic share count is seven percent lower, while our 
common equity is actually more than seven times higher.
These efforts not only protected near-term returns, they 
have also positioned the firm to benefit from operating 
leverage when the environment improves.
As the cycle turns, our strategic focus shifts to growing 
revenues and the ability to deliver greater operating leverage 
to our shareholders through margin expansion. In that vein, 
we want to review our businesses and opportunities.
Investment Banking
In Investment Banking, we have the preeminent client 
franchise. We advised on more than $1 trillion of announced 
transactions last year, the highest level since 2007. We have 
maintained a leading market share over the last 25 years.  
We maintained our market position when M&A activity was 
dominated by technology in 1999, by financials in 2008  
and by natural resources in 2014.
And, we have maintained our position when volumes were 
low and when they were higher. Our performance carries 
through to different industries, market environments and 
regions. Our success is rooted in decades of investment, 
consistency of coverage and a broad client franchise by  
both industry and geography.
We see a number of growth opportunities on the horizon. 
Global economic growth continues to be the biggest driver 
of the opportunity set. In 2014, global M&A volume as a 
percentage of market capitalization was roughly 100 basis 
points below the 15-year average. Returning to the historical 
average would drive $630 billion of incremental M&A volume.
We are particularly well-positioned for growth in cross-border 
activity given our global footprint. And, we believe that the 
demand for funding and capital remains highly correlated to 
economic growth and broader corporate activity.
Institutional Client Services
In Institutional Client Services, we benefit from having  
both a leading fixed income franchise and a leading equities 
franchise. And, we have a global footprint. While having a 
diversified mix of businesses supports revenue stability, it is 
also crucial to driving stable and attractive margins. We also

Letter to Shareholders
have a balance of activities and products that are “high” 
capital and “low” capital intensive.
Institutional Client Services is one of our most dynamic 
businesses. It has always been in a state of evolution.  
The introduction of new regulations has accelerated the 
evolution in certain areas, including market structure.  
As a consequence, the value placed on adaptability and 
operational excellence has significantly grown.
Regulatory requirements and technological investments  
have raised the barriers to entry higher than at any other  
time in recent history. This is an expensive business to be  
in if you don’t have the market share and scale. Consider  
the numerous business exits that have been announced by 
our peers, as they reassess their competitive positioning  
and relative returns.
Longer term, we believe that the value being placed on 
liquidity provisioning is likely to grow, especially in the 
context of a more rational marketplace. This provides an 
opportunity for market share expansion for those firms with 
strong, global and stable client franchises. Technological 
innovation will continue to be important and may increasingly 
become a differentiator amongst competitors and a potential 
driver of new or incremental revenues. Going forward, we 
believe that these requirements will likely lead to only a 
handful of players being able to effectively compete on  
a global basis.
Investing & Lending
Another core part of our mission and strategy is to provide 
promising businesses with the capital they need to grow. 
Sometimes that means offering a loan and, other times,  
it means making an equity investment. We are able to 
leverage our global investor network and invest alongside 
these clients in industries that create jobs and promote 
economic growth.
These loans and commitments include major infrastructure 
projects, clean energy and technology companies, and 
cutting-edge healthcare businesses. Including our own 
commitments, during 2014 we closed on more than 
$15 billion of debt and equity capital raised in private  
equity and credit funds.*
Our ability to provide equity capital has been important to 
growing companies. We have a diversified portfolio of

companies which helps drive strong performance for  
both our co-investors and shareholders. For example, 
between 2012 and 2014, our private equity and credit funds 
distributed more than $40 billion. And generally, our 
co-investors are clients of the firm, whether it is with 
Investment Banking, Institutional Client Services or 
Investment Management.
We will continue to invest and grow our existing investment 
strategies. At the same time, we will seek growth in new 
regions and across new strategies.
Lending has become an increasingly important part of our 
strategy as it relates to corporate, real estate and private 
wealth clients.
Our private wealth commitments and lending portfolio has 
been a particular source of significant growth. The portfolio 
benefits from both the level of collateralization and the fact 
that borrower credit quality for our average private wealth 
client is extremely high.
We see an opportunity to continue to grow our lending 
activities in ways that are accretive to current returns. Since 
2012, we’ve made great strides in this business, growing 
lending by roughly 100 percent. As we grow, we maintain 
our same conservative and rigorous risk management 
policies to ensure quality and prudence.
Investment Management
We have made significant progress in our Investment 
Management business over the last few years. Assets under 
supervision have grown 32 percent since 2011 to nearly  
$1.2 trillion at the end of 2014. Still, we are only the 
10th-largest asset manager globally, so there is significant  
room for growth. Within fixed income products, we are 
approximately 40 percent of the size of the largest peer.  
Within equities products, we are about one-quarter of the 
size of our largest competitor. And for alternatives, we are 
approximately two-thirds the size of the largest peer.
We remain focused on delivering strong performance for 
clients, which has already driven meaningful growth. At  
the end of last year, 83 percent of our client mutual fund 
assets ranked in the top two quartiles on a 3-year basis,  
and 75 percent ranked in the top two quartiles on a 5-year 
basis.** In 2014, Investment Management attracted over 
$85 billion in fee-based assets organically.

We also see attractive opportunities to expand our private 
wealth management platform. Among the distinguishing 
characteristics of this franchise is its connectivity to our 
investment banking efforts, which serves as an important 
sourcing mechanism. For example, the opportunity for our 
private wealth clients to invest in Facebook and Uber 
originated from a banking relationship.
We continue to invest in long-term strategic initiatives,  
like advisory, defined contribution, insurance and private 
banking. We have also looked for accretive acquisitions, 
having recently bought Deutsche Asset & Wealth 
Management’s stable value business and Dwight Asset 
Management. Performing for our clients and expanding  
our product offerings will help support continued growth 
going forward.
Our People
This year, we marked our 145th anniversary as a firm. 
Over that time, our people and culture have helped define 
our success. We place a huge priority on preserving and 
enhancing a tangible environment of teamwork, client 
focus and long-term stewardship. We are proud that these 
attributes are as strong and vibrant as ever.
In terms of recruiting, in 2014, nearly 270,000 applicants 
applied for 8,300 positions. And, of those receiving offers, 
nearly 90 percent chose to come to Goldman Sachs.
In November 2014, we announced our newest class of  
78 partners. The rigor and focus surrounding this biennial 
process is intense and that investment continues to pay 
dividends. The partnership is vital to helping ensure a real 
sense of long-term ownership.
For all of our people, we continue to invest in a workplace 
environment, including programs and training, which has 
consistently earned the firm recognition as one of the  
most attractive places to work.
In 2014, we were proud to be named as one of Fortune 
magazine’s “100 Best Companies to Work For.” Goldman 
Sachs is one of only five companies to be recognized every 
year that the Great Place to Work Institute has issued its list 
since 1984. And for nine consecutive years, the firm has 
been named to Working Mother magazine’s “100 Best 
Companies,” which ranks companies with the best programs 
that support working parents.
Few people have contributed more to our culture and 
generations of leaders at Goldman Sachs than John 
Whitehead. Earlier this year, John passed away. We honor 
his achievements and contributions in service to his  
country and our firm. John was a man of enormous grace 
and integrity, and his legacy will endure in the institutions  
he led and in the lives of those he cared for and mentored. 
We highlight John’s extraordinary contributions later in  
the Annual Report.
Our Board of Directors
We were also deeply sad to lose our former lead director, 
Jim Schiro, to cancer. Jim joined our Board of Directors in 
May 2009, and was elected lead director and named chair  
of the Corporate Governance, Nominating and Public 
Responsibilities Committee in May 2012.
Jim was an outstanding Board member and an exceptional 
individual who made an invaluable contribution to our firm 
and to all those who worked with him. We will remember 
him for his unfailing commitment to Goldman Sachs and 
to our shareholders and for the example he set as a leader 
and mentor.
He lived his life to make a difference and the mark he has 
left on institutions and people is powerful. Jim was 
methodical and careful, yet expansive and philosophical.  
He understood the black and white of the numbers better 
than anyone, but appreciated the human element better 
than most.
For a lot of his tenure on our Board, our firm faced tough 
scrutiny. He gave us the confidence to be proactive and to 
deal forthrightly with the issues we were confronting. He 
asked probing questions that always got to the heart of the 
matter. Jim had an enormous impact on Goldman Sachs,  
and on our leadership team. He made us a better company, 
and, for all those he worked with, better people.
Following Jim’s retirement, Adebayo Ogunlesi was appointed 
lead director and chair of the Corporate Governance, 
Nominating and Public Responsibilities Committee.
Adebayo is the managing partner and chairman of Global 
Infrastructure Partners, a private equity firm that invests 
worldwide in infrastructure assets. Previously, he held 
various positions at Credit Suisse Investment Bank (and 
predecessor firms), including as executive vice chairman  
and head of global investment banking. Adebayo’s extensive

knowledge of finance and global capital markets provides 
valuable insight and direction for our Board.
After 12 years of distinguished service, Claes Dahlbäck 
decided to retire from the Goldman Sachs Board of Directors 
this coming May.
Claes’ global experience, independent and wise judgment 
and quiet leadership made him an invaluable voice on our 
Board. His deep understanding of global markets, our 
business and our culture has benefited the firm enormously.
We thank him for his unfailing commitment to our 
shareholders and our people.
We are pleased to announce two additions to our Board of 
Directors, Mark Flaherty and Mark Winkelman.
Mark Flaherty has more than 20 years of experience in 
investment management. He served as vice chairman of 
Wellington Management Company before retiring in 2012. 
Previously, he was director of the company’s global 
investment services from 2002 to 2012, and served as 
partner and senior vice president from 2001 to 2012.
Mark Winkelman currently serves on the Board of Directors 
of Anheuser-Busch InBev. From 2006 to 2008, he served as 
operating partner of J.C. Flowers & Co. Previously, Mark  
held several leadership positions at Goldman Sachs before 
retiring from the firm in 1994, including co-head of the Fixed 
Income Division. During the course of his career, Mark has 
demonstrated exceptional judgment, market knowledge  
and risk management.
We know that our Board, our shareholders and our people 
will benefit from their deep and varied understanding of 
economies, global markets and the financial 
services industry.
Corporate Engagement
Throughout the year, Goldman Sachs continued to engage 
on broader public policy matters that have the potential to 
spur economic growth and stability. In June, we convened 
the North American Energy Summit to discuss how to 
maximize the economic benefits of North American energy 
resources through enhanced regional integration and 
cooperation. Policymakers and corporate and NGO leaders 
examined the impact of relevant geopolitical, economic  
and environmental factors around the enormous energy 
opportunity that will continue to have a profound influence 
on the global economy.

Goldman Sachs 2014 Annual Report
We hosted the China-U.S. CEO Bilateral Investment  
Dialogue in Beijing and later in New York, bringing CEOs of 
some of the largest Chinese and U.S. companies together 
with policymakers to discuss how to encourage more 
cross-border trade and investment. Our collective futures are 
dependent on the relationship between the U.S. and China, 
and there’s nothing more important to that relationship than 
advancing the mechanisms for more economic activity 
between these two countries.
And, as explained below, we attended various 10,000  
Small Businesses graduations across the U.S. At each  
event, whether it was in Detroit, Los Angeles or Miami,  
we saw how the combined impact from know-how and 
confidence can advance people and the local economy. And, 
with each entrepreneur we meet through 10,000 Women, 
we recognized how a practical business education and, 
increasingly, effective access to capital can transform a small 
business and consequently a family and a community.
10,000 Small Businesses
10,000 Small Businesses continued to help small business 
owners grow and create jobs through access to business 
and management education, business services and capital. 
By year’s end, 10,000 Small Businesses was operating in  
23 sites in the U.S. and U.K. and had served over 4,000 
entrepreneurs. In the U.S., we launched a new site in Dallas/
Fort Worth as well as the inaugural cohort of a new national 
partnership that allows qualified small business owners from 
across the U.S. to receive training both online and at Babson 
College. This innovative model has extended the reach of 
10,000 Small Businesses to business owners in 45 states 
across the U.S.
Stimulating Small Businesses Growth, a report released  
in 2014 from lead academic partner Babson College, 
demonstrates the impact of the program. Within six months 
of graduating, 64 percent of U.S. participants have reported 
increasing their revenues and 45 percent reported creating 
net new jobs. We are proud that the program maintains a  
99 percent graduation rate and graduates have developed  
a strong marketplace among themselves, as 80 percent of 
participants have done some form of business with 
another graduate.
10,000 Women
10,000 Women launched an important new partnership in 
2014 with International Finance Corporation (IFC), a member 
of the World Bank Group, to create the first-ever global 

--- Page 9 ---
finance facility dedicated exclusively to women-owned small-  
and medium-sized enterprises. The facility is a $600 million 
effort to enable approximately 100,000 women entrepreneurs 
to access capital. Since its launch, seven transactions in 
seven countries, including China, Brazil and Kenya, have 
been closed, representing over $150 million in commitments.
10,000 Women remains committed to providing a business 
and management education, mentoring and networking to 
high-potential women entrepreneurs around the world. Since 
it was announced in 2008, the initiative has reached more 
than 10,000 women entrepreneurs from over 40 countries 
around the world. Delivered through a network of 90 
academic and nonprofit partners, 10,000 Women continues 
to yield promising results. Nearly 70 percent of surveyed 
graduates have increased revenues and 60 percent have 
added new jobs.
Goldman Sachs Gives
Goldman Sachs Gives is a donor-advised fund through  
which participating managing directors (PMDs) of the firm 
can recommend grants to qualified nonprofit organizations 
around the world. In 2014, PMD compensation was reduced 
by approximately $157 million related to Goldman Sachs 
Gives, $137 million of which was a charitable contribution in 
2014, and 4,400 grants totaling more than $146 million were 
made to nonprofit organizations assisting underserved 
people and communities across a range of areas. Since the 
Goldman Sachs Gives’ launch in 2010, approximately 19,000 
grants totaling more than $860 million have been made to 
various nonprofits in 45 countries.
A continuing focus for Goldman Sachs Gives is its support  
of need-based financial aid to more than 200 colleges and 
universities globally to ensure students are able to complete 
their college degrees. In particular, a number of the firm’s 
partners, including all of the U.S.-based members of our 
Management Committee, recently made individual Goldman 
Sachs Gives’ grant recommendations to support LaGuardia 
Community College, based in Queens, New York. These 
grants represent the largest private donation in the school’s 
history. In addition, the partners’ recommendations created 
the Goldman Sachs Community College Fund to provide 
need-based financial aid to additional community colleges 
around the country.
As part of the firm’s commitment to hire and retain veterans, 
and support the military community, Goldman Sachs Gives 
remains focused on making grants to honor service and 
veterans. Demonstrating Goldman Sachs Gives’ scope, during 
2014, it supported nonprofit activities in 29 countries — from 
building libraries in Cambodia, to fighting Ebola in Africa, to 
raising awareness of hunger issues in India, and advancing 
cancer research in the United States and the United Kingdom.
Looking Ahead
The global economic recovery remains fragile and geo-
political risk in Europe and the Middle East will continue to 
have varying degrees of influence on market sentiment.
Still, conditions at this point are more conducive for our set 
of businesses than in recent years. Job growth in the U.S. is 
strong and prospects for above trend GDP growth are good. 
CEO confidence is up and consumer sentiment is generally 
better. More than six years after the financial crisis, we are 
finally seeing dispersion in central bank policies, which, over 
time, may contribute to more normalized markets and levels 
of volatility.
Over the last few years, we have protected and expanded 
our client franchise across our major businesses. Our client 
franchise today is as strong as ever. We have transformed 
the financial profile of the firm. We have been proactive in 
managing our cost structure. We have significantly adjusted 
both compensation levels and fixed expenses.
We have been judicious managers of capital. We have 
maintained our culture of client service and partnership.  
We remain the employer of choice in our industry.
Taken together, we are confident that we have positioned 
the firm to provide operating leverage for our shareholders  
as the economy and opportunity set improves.

TECHNOLOGY 
DRIVING INNOVATION, 
OPPORTUNITY  
AND TRANSFORMATION
Technological megatrends are transforming 
businesses, markets and entire economies
A t the 2014 Goldman Sachs Builders + Innovators Summit (B+I) honoring 
the 100 most intriguing entrepreneurs in the U.S., we brought together 
emerging business leaders and seasoned innovators to exchange ideas, 
insights and strategies. While the range of topics discussed were as 
compelling as the entrepreneurs themselves, the overarching theme 
emerging from the plenary sessions and informal conversations was that 
businesses across all industries must think of themselves as technology companies.
At B+I, each session returned to this central question concerning the role technology 
will play in shaping the business models and markets of tomorrow. We heard from 
athletic apparel executives on how wearables — devices worn on the body that 
measure physical activity — will reinvent their space; from healthcare innovators on  
the potential to connect tiny, ingestible sensors with users’ smartphones to track 
physiological data; and from medical entrepreneurs, outlining a new doctor-patient 
paradigm, with on-call medical experts and online behavioral therapies to enable people 
to more readily take charge of their own well-being and achieve healthier lifestyles.

Making our core product

is our big opportunity.

That the car has a bright future ahead of it is just as certain. 
Cars still fulfill the desire for individual mobility better than 
any  other  means  of  transport.  For  millions  of  people,  espe-
cially in emerging societies, their first car represents a longed 
for promise of  freedom and a symbol of prosperity. Last but 
not  least,  cars  are  losing  their  negative  qualities:  they  are 
becoming cleaner, safer, quieter and fully connected. 
This  is  precisely  what  the  Volkswagen  Group  and  its  brands 
work on every day. For this we are mobilizing massive financial 
resources.  In  the  next  five  years  alone,  €60 billion  will  be 
invested in topics of future relevance, €33 billion of which has 
been  earmarked  for  e-mobility  and  over  €14 billion  for  digi-
talization.  
What is special about Volkswagen is that we have the strength 
to finance the green and digital transformation from our own 
resources. We will safeguard the investments in our new tech-
nologies  through  our  successful  business  with  our  existing 
technologies. We will maintain this high level especially in the 
transformation  phase.  Customers  can  choose  from  highly 
efficient combustion engines, hybrids and completely battery-
electric drives. From the ŠKODA Kamiq to the Bentley Bentayga 
Hybrid, we have attractive and fascinating new models across 
all  segments  that  impress  customers  worldwide.  Another 
special highlight for us last year was the launch of the eighth 
generation of the Volkswagen Golf.  
2019 was an extremely successful year for our Group. Despite 
considerable  economic  uncertainty,  our  brands  performed 
exceedingly  well  around  the  world.  In  China,  we  lifted  our 
market  share  in  a  declining  market.  In  South  America,  we 
returned  to  profitability  for  the  first  time  in  many  years. 
Business in Russia is also profitable and continues to pick up 
speed.  And  in  North  America  we  significantly  improved  our 
earnings.  
rose  to  €252.6  billion.  Operating  profit  climbed  to  €17.0 bil-
lion,  and  before  special  items  to  €19.3  billion.  At  7.6%,  the 
operating  return  on  sales  before  special  items  was  slightly 
above  the  forecast  range.  Net  cash  flow  was  significantly 
higher  than  in  2018  at  €10.8  billion.  We  intend  to  maintain 
this course of qualitative growth, which is why we are aligning 
our  business  even  more  closely  with  our  financial  core  per-
formance indicators.  
2019  would  not  have  been  so  successful  without  the  huge 
commitment of our 670,000 employees, whom I would like to 
thank  very  warmly.  This  success  would  also  not  have  been 
possible without you, our shareholders. Of course you will also 
benefit  from  this  success.  The  Board  of  Management  and 
Supervisory  Board  are  therefore  proposing  a  significant 
increase in the dividend to €6.50 per ordinary share and €6.56 
per preferred share. 
In 2020, the main priority will be complying with the new CO2 
fleet limits in the European Union while maintaining the same 
level of profitability. We will leverage the synergies within the 
Group  much  more  consistently.  By  further  optimizing  our 
overall brand strategy, we will ensure that the Group as a whole 
can  exploit  the  profit  potential  of  the  market  even  more 
efficiently.  Further  productivity  gains  are  also  needed.  Cost-
cutting  programs  are  underway  in  all  brands.  There  is  con-
siderable potential at the German sites in particular. 
There is much to be done. Our industry is changing radically, 
with us in the driving seat. Volkswagen is on course to become 
a  climate-neutral  technology  group.  I  look  forward  to  your 
continued support on this journey. 
A strategic milestone in 2019 was the IPO of  TRATON. With this 
move, Volkswagen demonstrated that we are in a position to 
systematically  review  our  portfolio  and  take  decisive  action. 
This includes divesting ourselves of sections of our company 
to focus more squarely on our core automotive business.  
Sincerely, 
We are also improving the quality of our business. Sales Reve-
nue  and  profit  grew  faster  than  unit  sales.  Sales  Revenue
