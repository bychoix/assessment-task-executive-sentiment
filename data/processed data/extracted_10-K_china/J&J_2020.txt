Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition. In 2019, worldwide sales increased 0.6% to $82.1 billion as compared to an increase of 6.7% in 2018. These sales changes consisted of the following: Sales increase/(decrease) due to: 2019 2018 Volume 3.7 % 8.5 % Price (0.9 ) (2.2 ) Currency (2.2 ) 0.4 Total 0.6 % 6.7 % The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures on the worldwide sales growth was a negative impact of 1.7% in 2019 and a positive impact of 0.8% in 2018. Sales by U.S. companies were $42.1 billion in 2019 and $41.9 billion in 2018. This represents increases of 0.5% in 2019 and 5.1% in 2018. Sales by international companies were $40.0 billion in 2019 and $39.7 billion in 2018. This represents an increase of 0.7% in 2019 and 8.5% in 2018. The five-year compound annual growth rates for worldwide, U.S. and international sales were 2.0%, 3.9% and 0.2%, respectively. The ten-year compound annual growth rates for worldwide, U.S. and international sales were 2.9%, 3.1% and 2.6%, respectively. In 2019, sales by companies in Europe experienced a sales decline of 1.5% as compared to the prior year, which included operational growth of 3.8% offset by a negative currency impact of 5.3%. Sales by companies in the Western Hemisphere (excluding the U.S.) experienced a sales decline of 2.8% as compared to the prior year, which included operational growth of 5.7% offset by a negative currency impact of 8.5%. Sales by companies in the Asia-Pacific, Africa region achieved growth of 4.9% as compared to the prior year, including operational growth of 6.9% partially offset by a negative currency impact of 2.0%. In 2019, the Company utilized three wholesalers distributing products for all three segments that represented approximately 15.0%, 12.0% and 11.0% of the total consolidated revenues. In 2018, the Company had three wholesalers distributing products for all three segments that represented approximately 14.0%, 11.0% and 11.0% of the total consolidated revenues. 18 Analysis of Sales by Business Segments Consumer Segment Consumer segment sales in 2019 were $13.9 billion , an increase of 0.3% from 2018, which included 3.0% operational growth and a negative currency impact of 2.7%.  U.S. Consumer segment sales were $5.8 billion , an increase of 1.4% . International sales were $8.1 billion , a  decrease of 0.4% , which included 4.2% operational growth and a negative currency impact of 4.6%.  In 2019, acquisitions and divestitures had a net positive impact of 1.6% on the operational sales growth of the worldwide Consumer segment. Major Consumer Franchise Sales: % Change (Dollars in Millions) 2019 2018 ’19 vs. ’18 Beauty $ 4,593 4,382 4.8 % OTC 4,444 4,334 2.5 Baby Care 1,675 1,858 (9.9 ) Oral Care 1,528 1,555 (1.7 ) Women’s Health 986 1,049 (6.0 ) Wound Care/Other 671 675 (0.6 ) Total Consumer Sales $ 13,898 13,853 0.3 % The Beauty franchise sales of $4.6 billion increased 4.8% as compared to the prior year. Growth was primarily driven by incremental sales from the acquisition of Ci:z Holdings Co., Ltd., (DR.CI:LABO) in Japan as well as market growth and share gains of NEUTROGENA ® and AVEENO ® products. Growth was partially offset by the divestitures of RoC ® and NIZORAL ® in the fiscal year 2018. The Over-the-Counter (OTC) franchise sales of $4.4 billion increased 2.5% as compared to the prior year. Growth was primarily driven by incremental sales from the acquisition of ZARBEES ® . Additional contributors to the growth were TYLENOL ® , Children's MOTRIN ® , digestive health products and anti-smoking aids. The Baby Care franchise sales were $1.7 billion in 2019, a decrease of 9.9% compared to the prior year, primarily due to JOHNSON’s ® competitive pressures coupled with comparisons to prior year relaunch activities and the Baby Center divestiture. The Oral Care franchise sales of $1.5 billion decreased 1.7% as compared to the prior year. Growth in LISTERINE ® Mouthwash and Ready Tabs outside the U.S. was offset by share declines and retailer destocking in the U.S. and the negative impact of currency. The Women’s Health franchise sales were $1.0 billion in 2019, a decrease of 6.0% as compared to the prior year. The decline was primarily driven by the negative impact of currency and weakness in liners partially offset by strength in napkins in Asia Pacific and Latin America. The Wound Care/Other franchise sales were $0.7 billion in 2019, a decrease of 0.6% as compared to the prior year. The decline was primarily driven by the divestiture of COMPEED ® outside the U.S. and the negative impact of currency. 19 Pharmaceutical Segment Pharmaceutical segment sales in 2019 were $42.2 billion , an increase of 3.6% from 2018, which included operational growth of 5.8% and a negative currency impact of 2.2%.  U.S. sales were $23.9 billion , an increase of 2.5% . International sales were $18.3 billion , an increase of 5.0% , which included 10.1% operational growth and a negative currency impact of 5.1%.  In 2019, the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures on the Pharmaceutical segment operational sales growth was negligible. Adjustments to previous reserve estimates, as compared to the prior year, positively impacted the Pharmaceutical segment operational growth by approximately 1.3%, primarily in the Immunology and Cardiovascular/Metabolism/Other therapeutic areas.

Growth was driven by strong uptake of STELARA ® (ustekinumab) in Crohn's disease, and TREMFYA ® (guselkumab) in Psoriasis, expanded indications of SIMPONI ® /SIMPONI ARIA ® (golimumab), and the U.S. immunology market growth. Immunology was negatively impacted by lower sales of REMICADE ® (infliximab) due to increased discounts/rebates and biosimilar competition. The patents for REMICADE ® (infliximab) in certain countries in Europe expired in February 2015. Biosimilar versions of REMICADE ® have been introduced in certain markets outside the U.S., resulting in a reduction in sales of REMICADE ® in those markets.  Additional biosimilar competition will likely result in a further reduction in REMICADE ® sales in markets outside the United States. In the U.S., a biosimilar version of REMICADE ® was introduced in 2016, and additional competitors continue to enter the market. Continued infliximab biosimilar competition in the U.S. market will result in a further reduction in U.S. sales of REMICADE ® . See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of legal matters regarding the REMICADE ® patents. Infectious disease products sales were $3.4 billion in 2019, representing an increase of 3.3% as compared to the prior year. Strong sales of SYMTUZA ® and the launch of JULUCA ® (dolutegravir/rilpivirine) were partially offset by lower sales of PREZISTA ® and PREZCOBIX ® /REZOLSTA ® (darunavir/cobicistat) due to increased competition and loss of exclusivity of PREZISTA ® in certain countries outside the U.S. Neuroscience products sales were $6.3 billion , representing an increase of 4.1% as compared to the prior year. Strong sales of long-acting injectables INVEGA TRINZA ® /TREVICTA ® (paliperidone palmitate) and INVEGA SUSTENNA ® /XEPLION ® were partially offset by cannibalization of RISPERDAL CONSTA ® (risperidone). Oncology products achieved sales of $10.7 billion in 2019, representing an increase of 8.6% as compared to the prior year. Contributors to the growth were strong sales of DARZALEX ® (daratumumab) with continued market growth and share gain, IMBRUVICA ® (ibrutinib) due to increased patient uptake globally. Additionally, sales from the launch of ERLEADA™ (apalutamide) contributed to the growth. Growth was negatively impacted from a decline in U.S. sales of ZYTIGA ® (abiraterone acetate) driven by generic competition partially offset by increased sales outside the U.S.  Lower sales of VELCADE ® (bortezomib) were also due to generic competition. Pulmonary Hypertension products achieved sales of $2.6 billion , representing an increase of 1.9% as compared to the prior year.  Sales of OPSUMIT ® (macitentan) and UPTRAVI ® (selexipag) were due to continued market growth and increased share gains while sales of TRACLEER ® (bosentan) were negatively impacted by generics and cannibalization from OPSUMIT ® . Cardiovascular/Metabolism/Other products sales were $5.2 billion , a decline of 10.7% as compared to the prior year. XARELTO ® (rivaroxaban) sales volume growth was offset by higher discounts and rebates. Lower sales of INVOKANA ® /INVOKAMET ® (canagliflozin) were due to share loss from competitive pressure and a safety label update in the U.S. and lower sales of PROCRIT ® / EPREX ® (epoetin alfa) were due to biosimilar competition. 21 During 2019, the Company advanced its pipeline with several regulatory submissions and approvals for new drugs and additional indications for existing drugs as follows: Product Name          (Chemical Name) Indication US  Approval EU  Approval US Filing EU Filing BALVERSA™ (erdafitinib) Treatment of locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer Ÿ DARZALEX ® (daratumumab) Combination Regimen for Newly Diagnosed, Transplant-eligible Patients with Multiple Myeloma Ÿ Ÿ Newly diagnosed patients with Multiple Myeloma in combination with Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone Ÿ Split-dosing regimen Ÿ Combination therapy for transplant ineligible Multiple Myeloma patients Ÿ Ÿ Subcutaneous Formulation in Multiple Myeloma Ÿ Ÿ ERLEADA™                         (apalutamide) Treatment of Metastatic Castration-Sensitive Prostate Cancer Ÿ Treatment of Metastatic Hormone-Sensitive Prostate Cancer Ÿ IMBRUVICA ® (ibrutinib) Expanded Use in Combination with Obinutuzumab in Adult Patients with Previously Untreated Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia and in Combination with Rituximab in Waldenström's Macroglobulinemia Ÿ Treatment for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia in combination with obinutuzumab Ÿ INVOKANA ® (canagliflozin) Treatment of Diabetic Kidney Disease Ÿ rilpivirine and cabotegravir For Monthly, Injectable, Two Drug Regimen for Treatment of HIV Ÿ Ÿ SPRAVATO ® (esketamine) Treatment-resistant depression Ÿ Ÿ Rapid Reduction of Depressive Symptoms in Adults with Major Depressive Disorder who have Active Suicidal Ideation with Intent Ÿ STELARA ® (ustekinumab) Extended Use for the Treatment of Moderately to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis Ÿ Ÿ Treatment of Pediatric Patients with Moderate to Severe Plaque Psoriasis Ÿ TREMFYA ® (guselkumab) One-press patient-controlled injector Ÿ Treatment of Adults with Active Psoriatic Arthritis Ÿ Ÿ XARELTO ® (rivaroxaban) For the prevention of Blood Clots in Acutely Ill Medical Patients Ÿ 22 Medical Devices Segment The Medical Devices segment sales in 2019 were $26.0 billion , a decrease of 3.8% from 2018, which included an operational decrease of 1.7% and a negative currency impact of 2.1%. U.S. sales were $12.4 billion , a decrease of 3.5% as compared to the prior year. International sales were $13.6 billion , a decrease of 4.1% as compared to the prior year, with an operational decrease of 0.1% and a negative currency impact of 4.0%. In 2019, the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures on the Medical Devices segment worldwide operational sales growth was a negative 5.6% of which, the divestitures of LifeScan and Advanced Sterilization Products (ASP) had an impact of approximately 3.8% and 1.6%, respectively.

Growth in Advanced Surgery was primarily driven by endocutter, biosurgery and energy products. The decline in General Surgery was primarily driven by the negative impact of currency partially offset by growth of wound closure products. The decline in Specialty Surgery was primarily driven by the divestiture of the sterilization business (ASP) partially offset by growth of aesthetic products. The Orthopaedics franchise sales were $8.8 billion in 2019, a decrease of 0.5% , including operational growth of 1.2% offset by a negative currency impact of 1.7% as compared to the prior year. The growth in hips was driven by leadership position in the anterior approach, strong market demand for the ACTIS ® stem and the KINCISE™ surgical automated system. Knees grew outside the U.S. from new products coupled with continued global uptake of ATTUNE ® Revision, offset by a negative currency impact. Growth in trauma was due to strong market growth coupled with continued uptake of new products. The decline in Spine & Other was primarily driven by base business declines in Spine partially offset by growth in Sports which was led by new products, MONOVISC ® in the U.S. and growth in Asia Pacific. The Vision franchise achieved sales of $4.6 billion in 2019, an increase of 1.6% from 2018. Growth was primarily driven by the strength of daily disposable lenses in the ACUVUE ® OASYS contact lenses category. The Surgical operational growth was primarily driven by the strength of cataracts outside the U.S. partially offset by competitive pressures in the U.S. The Interventional Solutions franchise achieved sales of $3.0 billion in 2019, an increase of 13.3% from 2018. Strong growth in the electrophysiology business was driven by Atrial Fibrillation procedure growth and with strong THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH ® SF Contact Force Sensing Catheter and diagnostic catheter sales. 23 Analysis of Consolidated Earnings Before Provision for Taxes on Income Consolidated earnings before provision for taxes on income was $17.3 billion and $18.0 billion for the fiscal years ended 2019 and 2018, respectively. As a percent to sales, consolidated earnings before provision for taxes on income was 21.1% and 22.1%, in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Cost of Products Sold and Selling, Marketing and Administrative Expenses: Cost of products sold and selling, marketing and administrative expenses as a percent to sales were as follows: % of Sales 2019 2018 Cost of products sold 33.6 % 33.2 Percent point increase/(decrease) over the prior year 0.4 (0.1 ) Selling, marketing and administrative expenses 27.0 % 27.6 Percent point increase/(decrease) over the prior year (0.6 ) (0.5 ) In 2019, cost of products sold as a percent to sales increased to 33.6% from 33.2% as compared to the same period a year ago primarily driven by the negative impact of currency in the Pharmaceutical business as well as increased intangible asset amortization expense. Intangible asset amortization expense of $4.5 billion was included in cost of products sold for 2019 as compared to $4.4 billion in 2018. There was a decrease in the percent to sales of selling, marketing and administrative expenses in 2019 as compared to the prior year, primarily due to favorable segment mix with a higher percentage of sales coming from the Pharmaceutical business, planned prioritization and reduced brand marketing expense in the Consumer business partially offset by increased selling and marketing investments in the Medical Devices business. Research and Development Expense: Research and development expense by segment of business was as follows: 2019 2018 (Dollars in Millions) Amount % of Sales* Amount % of Sales* Consumer $ 493 3.5 % 565 4.1 Pharmaceutical 8,834 20.9 8,446 20.7 Medical Devices 2,028 7.8 1,764 6.5 Total research and development expense $ 11,355 13.8 % 10,775 13.2 Percent increase/(decrease) over the prior year 5.4 % 1.7 *As a percent to segment sales 24 Research and development activities represent a significant part of the Company's business. These expenditures relate to the processes of discovering, testing and developing new products, upfront payments and developmental milestones, improving existing products, as well as ensuring product efficacy and regulatory compliance prior to launch. The Company remains committed to investing in research and development with the aim of delivering high quality and innovative products. In 2019, worldwide costs of research and development activities increased by 5.4% compared to 2018 primarily driven by increased investment in the Medical Devices business related to robotics and digital surgery platforms along with higher upfront and developmental milestone payments, primarily from the argenx collaboration in the Pharmaceutical business. Research facilities are located in the U.S., Belgium, Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, Israel, the Netherlands, Poland, Singapore, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom with additional R&D support in over 30 other countries. In-Process Research and Development (IPR&D): In the fiscal first quarter of 2019, the Company recorded an IPR&D charge of $0.9 billion for the remaining intangible asset value related to the development program of AL-8176, an investigational drug for the treatment of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) acquired with the 2014 acquisition of Alios Biopharma Inc. The impairment charge was based on additional information, including clinical data, which became available and led to the Company's decision to abandon the development of AL-8176. In the fiscal third quarter of 2018, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $1.1 billion which included a partial impairment charge of $0.8 billion related to the development program of AL-8176 and an impairment charge of $0.3 billion for the discontinuation of the development project for an anti-thrombin antibody associated with the 2015 acquisition of XO1 Limited. Other (Income) Expense, Net: Other (income) expense, net is the account where the Company records gains and losses related to the sale and write-down of certain investments in equity securities held by Johnson & Johnson Innovation - JJDC, Inc. (JJDC), unrealized gains and losses on investments, gains and losses on divestitures, certain transactional currency gains and losses, acquisition-related costs, litigation accruals and settlements, as well as royalty income. The change in other (income) expense, net for the fiscal year 2019 was additional net expense of $1.1 billion primarily attributable to litigation expense of $5.1 billion in 2019, primarily related to the agreement in principle to settle opioid litigation of $4.0 billion, as compared to litigation expense of $2.0 billion in 2018. This was partially offset by divestiture gains in 2019 of $2.2 billion of which $2.0 billion related to the divestiture of the ASP business. In addition, the fiscal year 2019 included higher unrealized gains on securities of $0.7 billion, an equity step-up gain of $0.3 billion related to the Company's previously held equity investment in DR. CI:LABO, and lower restructuring related expense of $0.2 billion as compared to the same period a year ago. Divestiture gains were approximately $1.2 billion in 2018 and included the LifeScan business, NIZORAL ® , RoC ® and certain non-strategic Pharmaceutical products. Additionally, 2018 included a reversal of a contingent liability of $0.2 billion. Interest (Income) Expense: The fiscal year 2019 included net interest income as compared to an expense in the fiscal year 2018. This was primarily due to the positive effect of net investment hedging arrangements and certain cross currency swaps, and a lower average debt balance. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $19.3 billion at the end of 2019, and averaged $19.5 billion as compared to the cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities total of $19.7 billion and $19.0 billion average cash balance in 2018. The total debt balance at the end of 2019 was $27.7 billion with an average debt balance of $29.1 billion as compared to $30.5 billion at the end of 2018 and an average debt balance of $32.5 billion. The decrease in debt was due to the retirement of long-term debt. Income Before Tax by Segment Income before tax by segment of business were as follows: Income Before Tax Segment Sales Percent of Segment Sales (Dollars in Millions) 2019 2018 2019 2018 2019 2018 Consumer $ 2,061 2,320 13,898 13,853 14.8 % 16.7 Pharmaceutical 8,816 12,568 42,198 40,734 20.9 30.9 Medical Devices 7,286 4,397 25,963 26,994 28.1 16.3 Total (1) 18,163 19,285 82,059 81,581 22.1 23.6 Less: Net expense not allocated to segments (2) 835 1,286 Earnings before provision for taxes on income $ 17,328 17,999 82,059 81,581 21.1 % 22.1 (1) See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details. (2) Amounts not allocated to segments include interest (income) expense and general corporate (income) expense. 25 Consumer Segment: In 2019, the Consumer segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 14.8% , versus 16.7% in 2018. The decrease in the income before tax as a percent of sales in 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily attributable to higher expenses for litigation of $0.1 billion, intangible asset amortization of $0.1 billion and restructuring of $0.1 billion in the fiscal year 2019 as compared to the fiscal year 2018. This was partially offset by planned prioritization and brand marketing expense reductions. The fiscal year 2019 included a gain of $0.3 billion related to the Company's previously held equity investment in DR. CI:LABO. Divestiture gains for the fiscal year of 2018 included a gain of $0.3 billion from the divestiture of NIZORAL ® . Pharmaceutical Segment: In 2019, the Pharmaceutical segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 20.9% versus 30.9% in 2018. The decrease in the income before tax as a percent of sales was primarily due to higher litigation expense of $4.3 billion, primarily due to the agreement in principle to settle opioid litigation of $4.0 billion, increased spending in research and development, including a $0.3 billion upfront payment to argenx. This was partially offset by $0.8 billion of higher unrealized gains on securities, a lower in-process research and development charge of $0.2 billion, and lower Actelion acquisition and integration related costs as compared to the fiscal year 2018. In addition, the fiscal year 2018 included a contingent liability reversal of $0.2 billion and higher divestiture gains of $0.2 billion. Medical Devices Segment: In 2019, the Medical Devices segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 28.1% versus 16.3% in 2018. The increase in the income before tax as a percent to sales was primarily attributable to higher divestiture gains in 2019. Divestiture gains in the fiscal 2019 included a gain of $2.0 billion related to the ASP business. Divestiture gains for the fiscal year of 2018 included a gain of $0.5 billion related to LifeScan. Additionally, the fiscal year 2019 included lower litigation expense of $1.3 billion, lower restructuring charges of $0.2 billion and lower intangible asset amortization expense of $0.1 billion as compared to the fiscal year 2018. This was partially offset by increased investment in robotics and digital solutions. Restructuring: In the fiscal second quarter of 2018, the Company announced plans to implement actions across its global supply chain that are intended to enable the Company to focus resources and increase investments in critical capabilities, technologies and solutions necessary to manufacture and supply its product portfolio of the future, enhance agility and drive growth. The Company expects these supply chain actions will include expanding its use of strategic collaborations, and bolstering its initiatives to reduce complexity, improving cost-competitiveness, enhancing capabilities and optimizing its network.  Discussions regarding specific future actions are ongoing and are subject to all relevant consultation requirements before they are finalized. In total, the Company expects these actions to generate approximately $0.6 to $0.8 billion in annual pre-tax cost savings that will be substantially delivered by 2022. The Company expects to record pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $1.9 to $2.3 billion. The Company estimates that approximately 70% of the cumulative pre-tax costs will result in cash outlays. In 2019, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $0.6 billion, which is included on the following lines of the Consolidated Statement of Earnings, $0.3 billion in restructuring, $0.2 billion in other (income) expense and $0.1 billion in cost of products sold. Total project costs of approximately $0.8 billion have been recorded since the restructuring was announced. See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to the restructuring programs. Provision for Taxes on Income: The worldwide effective income tax rate was 12.7% in 2019 and 15.0% in 2018 . For discussion related to the fiscal 2019 provision for taxes refer to Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. On September 28, 2018 the Swiss Parliament approved the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing (TRAF). On May 19, 2019 a public referendum was held in Switzerland that approved the federal reform proposals. In the fiscal third quarter of 2019, the Swiss Federal Council enacted TRAF which became effective on January 1, 2020. On February 9, 2020 a public referendum on the legislative change was held in the last remaining canton where the Company has significant operations. The legislation was approved by the voters and formal enactment is expected in the fiscal first half of 2020. The Company has not yet elected the transitional provision in this canton. However, the net financial benefit is estimated to be between $0.2 billion and $0.5 billion in the fiscal first half of 2020. The Company does not believe that TRAF will have a material impact to the Company’s ongoing consolidated effective tax rate beginning in fiscal year 2020. 26 Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity & Cash Flows Cash and cash equivalents were $17.3 billion at the end of 2019 as compared to $18.1 billion at the end of 2018. The primary sources and uses of cash that contributed to the $0.8 billion decrease were approximately $23.4 billion of cash generated from operating activities. This was offset by $6.2 billion net cash used by investing activities and $18.0 billion net cash used by financing activities. In addition, the Company had $2.0 billion in marketable securities at the end of 2019 and $1.6 billion at the end of 2018. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Cash flow from operations of $23.4 billion was the result of $15.1 billion of net earnings and $9.1 billion of non-cash expenses and other adjustments for depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, assets write-downs (primarily related to the Alios IPR&D asset), and favorable increases in accounts payable, accrued liabilities and other liabilities of $5.5 billion. This was reduced by $1.6 billion related to an increase in accounts receivable, inventories, other current and non-current assets. as well as non-cash expenses and other adjustments of $2.5 billion for the increase in the deferred tax provision and a net gain on sale of assets/businesses of $2.2 billion (primarily related to the ASP divestiture). Investing activities use of $6.2 billion of cash was primarily used for acquisitions of $5.8 billion primarily related to the acquisitions of Auris Health, Inc. and DR. CI:LABO, additions to property, plant and equipment of $3.5 billion and $0.5 billion from the net purchases of investments. Investing activities also included a source of $3.3 billion of proceeds from the disposal of assets/businesses, primarily the ASP divestiture, and proceeds from credit support agreements of $0.3 billion. Financing activities use of $18.0 billion of cash was primarily used for dividends to shareholders of $9.9 billion, the repurchase of common stock of $6.7 billion and the net retirement of short and long term debt of $2.9 billion. Financing activities also included sources of $1.5 billion from proceeds of stock options exercised/employee withholding tax on stock awards, and other financing activities. On December 17, 2018, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program, authorizing the Company to purchase up to $5.0 billion of the Company's shares of common stock. Shares acquired are available for general corporate purposes. The Company financed the share repurchase program through available cash. As of September 29, 2019, $5.0 billion was repurchased under the program and the program was completed. As of December 29, 2019, the Company's notes payable and long-term debt was in excess of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. As of December 29, 2019, the net debt position was $8.4 billion as compared to the prior year of $10.8 billion. There was a decrease in the net debt position due to retirement of debt. The debt balance at the end of 2019 was $27.7 billion as compared to $30.5 billion in 2018. In 2019, the Company continued to have access to liquidity through the commercial paper market. Additionally, as a result of the TCJA, the Company has access to its cash outside the U.S. at a significantly reduced cost. The Company anticipates that operating cash flows, the ability to raise funds from external sources, borrowing capacity from existing committed credit facilities and access to the commercial paper markets will continue to provide sufficient resources to fund operating needs, including the agreement in principle to settle opioid litigation to be potentially paid over the next two to three years. As discussed in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has completed its audit for the tax years through 2009 and is currently auditing the tax years 2010-2012.  The Company currently expects completion of this audit and settlement of the related tax liabilities in the fiscal year 2020. As of December 29, 2019, the Company has classified unrecognized tax benefits and related interest of approximately $0.9 billion as a current liability in the “Accrued taxes on Income” line in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. This is the amount expected to be paid over the next 12 months with respect to the IRS audit. Subsequent to December 29, 2019, the Company made a payment for approximately $0.6 billion to the U.S. Treasury related to the estimated 2010-2012 tax audit liability in anticipation of the final settlement later in fiscal 2020. The completion of this tax audit may result in additional adjustments to the Company’s unrecognized tax benefit liability that may have a material impact on the Company’s future operating results or cash flows in the period that the audit is substantially completed. The Company monitors the global capital markets on an ongoing basis and from time to time may raise capital when market conditions are favorable.  The Company filed a shelf registration on February 27, 2017, which will enable it to issue debt securities on a timely basis and will be updated as required. For additional details on borrowings, see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Financing and Market Risk The Company uses financial instruments to manage the impact of foreign exchange rate changes on cash flows. Accordingly, the Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to protect the value of certain foreign currency assets and liabilities and to hedge future foreign currency transactions primarily related to product costs. Gains or losses on these contracts are offset by the gains or losses on the underlying transactions. A 10% appreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the December 29, 2019 market rates would increase the unrealized value of the Company’s forward contracts by $271 million.  Conversely, a 27 10% depreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the December 29, 2019 market rates would decrease the unrealized value of the Company’s forward contracts by $331 million. In either scenario, the gain or loss on the forward contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction, and therefore, would have no impact on future anticipated earnings and cash flows. The Company hedges the exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and the effect on certain assets and liabilities in foreign currency, by entering into currency swap contracts. A 1% change in the spread between U.S. and foreign interest rates on the Company’s interest rate sensitive financial instruments would either increase or decrease the unrealized value of the Company’s swap contracts by approximately $1,043 million. In either scenario, at maturity, the gain or loss on the swap contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction, and therefore, would have no impact on future anticipated cash flows. The Company does not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Further, the Company has a policy of only entering into contracts with parties that have at least an investment grade credit rating. The counter-parties to these contracts are major financial institutions and there is no significant concentration of exposure with any one counter-party. Management believes the risk of loss is remote. During the fiscal second quarter of 2017, the Company entered into credit support agreements (CSA) with certain derivative counterparties establishing collateral thresholds based on respective credit ratings and netting agreements. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on credit support agreements. The Company invests in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities which carry a degree of interest rate risk. The fair market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall. A 1% (100 basis points) change in spread on the Company’s interest rate sensitive investments would either increase or decrease the unrealized value of cash equivalents and current marketable securities by approximately $7 million. The Company has access to substantial sources of funds at numerous banks worldwide. In September 2019, the Company secured a new 364-day Credit Facility. Total credit available to the Company approximates $10 billion, which expires on September 10, 2020.  Interest charged on borrowings under the credit line agreement is based on either bids provided by banks, the prime rate, London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR), or other applicable market rate as allowed under the terms of the agreement, plus applicable margins. Commitment fees under the agreement are not material. Total borrowings at the end of 2019 and 2018 were $27.7 billion and $30.5 billion, respectively. The decrease in borrowings was due to the retirement of debt in 2019. In 2019, net debt (cash and current marketable securities, net of debt) was $8.4 billion compared to net debt of $10.8 billion in 2018. Total debt represented 31.8% of total capital (shareholders’ equity and total debt) in 2019 and 33.8% of total capital in 2018. Shareholders’ equity per share at the end of 2019 was $22.59 compared to $22.44 at year-end 2018 . A summary of borrowings can be found in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Contractual Obligations and Commitments The Company’s contractual obligations are primarily for the recently enacted tax legislation, leases, debt and unfunded retirement plans.  There are no other significant obligations. To satisfy these obligations, the Company will use cash from operations.
