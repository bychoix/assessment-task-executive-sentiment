Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition. In 2020, worldwide sales increased 0.6% to $82.6 billion as compared to an increase of 0.6% in 2019. These sales changes consisted of the following: Sales increase/(decrease) due to: 2020 2019 Volume 3.5 % 3.7 % Price (2.3) (0.9) Currency (0.6) (2.2) Total 0.6 % 0.6 % The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures on the worldwide sales growth was a negative impact of 0.3% in 2020 and a negative impact of 1.7% in 2019. Sales by U.S. companies were $43.1 billion in 2020 and $42.1 billion in 2019. This represents increases of 2.5% in 2020 and 0.5% in 2019. Sales by international companies were $39.5 billion in 2020 and $40.0 billion in 2019. This represents a decrease of 1.3% in 2020 and an increase of 0.7% in 2019. The five-year compound annual growth rates for worldwide, U.S. and international sales were 3.3%, 3.9% and 2.8%, respectively. The ten-year compound annual growth rates for worldwide, U.S. and international sales were 3.0%, 3.9% and 2.1%, respectively. In 2020, sales by companies in Europe achieved growth of 2.8% as compared to the prior year, which included operational growth of 2.0% and a positive currency impact of 0.8%. Sales by companies in the Western Hemisphere (excluding the U.S.) experienced a sales decline of 10.2% as compared to the prior year, which included operational growth of 0.4% offset by a negative currency impact of 10.6%. Sales by companies in the Asia-Pacific, Africa region experienced a sales decline of 2.7% as compared to the prior year, including an operational decline of 3.1% partially offset by a positive currency impact of 0.4%. The 2020 results benefited from the inclusion of a 53rd week. (See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for Annual Closing Date details). The Company estimated that the fiscal year 2020 sales growth rate was enhanced by approximately 1.0%. While the additional week added a few days to sales, it also added a full week's worth of operating costs; therefore, the net earnings impact was negligible. In 2020, the Company utilized three wholesalers distributing products for all three segments that represented approximately 16.0%, 12.0% and 12.0% of the total consolidated revenues. In 2019, the Company had three wholesalers distributing products for all three segments that represented approximately 15.0%, 12.0% and 11.0% of the total consolidated revenues. Note: values may have been rounded 20 Analysis of Sales by Business Segments Consumer Health Segment Consumer Health segment sales in 2020 were $14.1 billion, an increase of 1.1% from 2019, which included 3.0% operational growth and a negative currency impact of 1.9%.  U.S. Consumer Health segment sales were $6.4 billion, an increase of 9.0%. International sales were $7.7 billion, a decrease of 4.6%, which included an operational decline of 1.3% and a negative currency impact of 3.3%.  In 2020, acquisitions and divestitures had a net negative impact of 0.1% on the operational sales growth of the worldwide Consumer Health segment. Major Consumer Health Franchise Sales*: % Change (Dollars in Millions) 2020 2019 ’20 vs. ’19 OTC $ 4,824 4,444 8.5 % Skin Health/Beauty** 4,450 4,593 (3.1) Oral Care 1,641 1,528 7.4 Baby Care 1,517 1,675 (9.4) Women’s Health 901 986 (8.6) Wound Care/Other 720 671 7.2 Total Consumer Health* Sales $ 14,053 13,898 1.1 % * Previously referred to as Consumer ** Previously referred to as Beauty The OTC franchise sales of $4.8 billion increased 8.5% as compared to the prior year. Growth was primarily attributable to sales from TYLENOL ® driven by COVID-19 stocking demand, ZYRTEC ® due to competitor product out of stock and PEPCID ® due to competitive product withdrawal both in the U.S., and increased consumption in anti-smoking aids. International sales were negatively impacted by COVID-19 and low incidence of cough and flu. The Skin Health/Beauty franchise sales were $4.5 billion in 2020, a decrease of 3.1% as compared to the prior year. The decline was primarily due to negative COVID-19 related impacts and SKU rationalization partially offset by growth in eCommerce and new product innovation. The Oral Care franchise sales of $1.6 billion increased 7.4% as compared to the prior year primarily attributable to sales of LISTERINE ® mouthwash due to U.S. eCommerce and club channel growth, increased stocking demand related to COVID-19 and new product launches in Asia Pacific. The Baby Care franchise sales were $1.5 billion in 2020, a decrease of 9.4% compared to the prior year. The decline was primarily due to COVID-19 related impacts, SKU rationalization and the Baby Center divestiture in the U.S. partially offset by strength in AVEENO ® baby. The Women’s Health franchise sales were $0.9 billion in 2020, a decrease of 8.6% as compared to the prior year. The decline was primarily driven by COVID-19 impacts. The Wound Care/Other franchise sales were $0.7 billion in 2020, an increase of 7.2% as compared to the prior year. Growth was due to strong performance of NEOSPORIN ® and BAND-AID ® Brand Adhesive Bandages and COVID-19 related demand in the Asia Pacific region. 21 Pharmaceutical Segment Pharmaceutical segment sales in 2020 were $45.6 billion, an increase of 8.0% from 2019, which included operational growth of 8.2% and a negative currency impact of 0.2%.  U.S. sales were $25.7 billion, an increase of 7.8%. International sales were $19.8 billion, an increase of 8.3%, which included 8.8% operational growth and a negative currency impact of 0.5%. In 2020, acquisitions and divestitures had a net negative impact of 0.2% on the operational sales growth of the worldwide Pharmaceutical segment. Adjustments to previous reserve estimates positively impacted the Pharmaceutical segment operational growth by approximately 1.0% in both fiscal years 2020 and 2019.

This was partially offset by COVID-19 related demand and lower sales of REMICADE ® (infliximab) due to increased discounts/rebates and biosimilar competition. The patents for REMICADE ® (infliximab) in certain countries in Europe expired in February 2015. Biosimilar versions of REMICADE ® have been introduced in certain markets outside the United States, resulting in a reduction in sales of REMICADE ® in those markets.  Additional biosimilar competition will likely result in a further reduction in sales of REMICADE ® in markets outside the United States. In the United States, a biosimilar version of REMICADE ® was introduced in 2016, and additional competitors continue to enter the market. Continued infliximab biosimilar competition in the U.S. market will result in a further reduction in U.S. sales of REMICADE ® . Infectious disease products sales were $3.6 billion in 2020, representing an increase of 4.7% as compared to the prior year primarily due to strong sales of SYMTUZA ® and JULUCA ® . This was partially offset by lower sales of PREZISTA ® and PREZCOBIX ® /REZOLSTA ® due to increased competition and loss of exclusivity of PREZISTA ® in certain countries outside the U.S. Neuroscience products sales were $6.5 billion, representing an increase of 3.5% as compared to the prior year. Paliperidone long-acting injectables growth driven by sales of INVEGA SUSTENNA ® /XEPLION ® (paliperidone palmitate) and INVEGA TRINZA ® /TREVICTA ® from new patient starts and persistence. The growth was partially offset by migration from RISPERDAL CONSTA ® (risperidone) and declines in CONCERTA ® (methylphenidate) due to competitive entrants. Oncology products achieved sales of $12.4 billion in 2020, representing an increase of 15.7% as compared to the prior year. Contributors to the growth were strong sales of DARZALEX ® (daratumumab) driven by patient uptake in all lines of therapy and the launch of a subcutaneous formulation in the U.S. and E.U.; IMBRUVICA ® (ibrutinib) due to market growth globally and maintaining strong share and the continued global launch uptake and share gains of ERLEADA ® (apalutamide). Additionally, the growth was negatively impacted by declining sales of ZYTIGA ® (abiraterone acetate) and VELCADE ® (bortezomib) due to generic competition. Pulmonary Hypertension products achieved sales of $3.1 billion, representing an increase of 20.0% as compared to the prior year. Sales growth of OPSUMIT ® (macitentan) and UPTRAVI ® (selexipag) were due to continued share gains and market growth. Additionally, sales of TRACLEER ® (bosentan) were negatively impacted by generics and migration to OPSUMIT ® . Cardiovascular/Metabolism/Other products sales were $4.9 billion, a decline of 6.0% as compared to the prior year. Sales growth of INVOKANA ® /INVOKAMET ® (canagliflozin) were due to market growth and favorable channel mix dynamics in the U.S. and strength in the European region partially offset by U.S. share declines due to competitive pressures. The growth of XARELTO ® (rivaroxaban) was due to demand growth partially offset by higher rebates. Lower sales of PROCRIT ® / EPREX ® (epoetin alfa) were due to biosimilar competition. 23 During 2020, the Company advanced its pipeline with several regulatory submissions and approvals for new drugs and additional indications for existing drugs as follows: Product Name          (Chemical Name) Indication US  Approval EU  Approval US Filing EU Filing Amivantamab Treatment of Patients with Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer with EGFR Exon 20 Insertion Mutations • • DARZALEX ® (daratumumab) Combination Regimen for Newly Diagnosed, Transplant-eligible Patients with Multiple Myeloma • DARZALEX ® (daratumumab) Combination with Carfilzomib and Dexamethasone for patients with Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma • DARZALEX ® FASPRO (daratumumab and hyaluronidase) Subcutaneous Formulation of Daratumumab in the Treatment of Patients with Multiple Myeloma • • ERLEADA ® (apalutamide) Treatment of Metastatic Castration-Sensitive Prostate Cancer • IMBRUVICA ® (ibrutinib) In combination with Rituximab for treatment of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia • INVOKANA ® (canagliflozin) Treatment of Diabetic Kidney Disease • rilpivirine and cabotegravir For Monthly, Injectable, Two Drug Regimen for Treatment of HIV • • Paliperidone Pamitate 6-month Treatment of Schizophrenia • • Ponesimod Treatment of adults with Relapsed Multiple Sclerosis • • SIMPONI ARIA ® (golimumab) Treatment of Polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis and Juvenile Psoriatic Arthritis • SIRTURO ® (bedaquiline) Combination Therapy to Treat Children with Pulmonary Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis • • SPRAVATO ® (esketamine) Rapid Reduction of Depressive Symptoms in Adults with Major Depressive Disorder who have Active Suicidal Ideation with Intent • STELARA ® (ustekinumab) Treatment of Pediatric Patients with Moderate to Severe Plaque Psoriasis • • TREMFYA ® (guselkumab) Treatment of Adults with Active Psoriatic Arthritis • • Uptravi ® IV Pulmonary arterial hypertension • XARELTO ® (rivaroxaban) New Indication to Expand Use in Patients with Peripheral Artery Disease • ZABDENO (Ad26.ZEBOV) and MVABEA (MVA-BN-Filo) Preventive Ebola Vaccine • 24 Medical Devices Segment The Medical Devices segment sales in 2020 were $23.0 billion, a decrease of 11.6% from 2019, which included an operational decrease of 11.4% and a negative currency impact of 0.2%.

International sales were $11.9 billion, a decrease of 12.2% as compared to the prior year, with an operational decrease of 11.8% and a negative currency impact of 0.4%. In 2020, the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures on the Medical Devices segment worldwide operational sales growth was a negative 0.9% of which, the divestiture of Advanced Sterilization Products (ASP) had an impact of approximately 0.8%. Growth was negatively impacted by COVID-19 and associated deferral of medical procedures.

The decline in Advanced Surgery was primarily driven by the negative impact of COVID-19 and competitive pressures in the U.S. This was partially offset by the success of new products outside the U.S. and the recovery of an isolated supply disruption in the prior year related to SURGIFLO ® . The decline in General Surgery was primarily driven by the negative impact of COVID-19 and the ASP divestiture. The Orthopaedics franchise sales were $7.8 billion in 2020, a decrease of 12.2% from 2019. The decline in hips was driven by the negative impact of COVID-19 partially offset by a leadership position in the Anterior approach, strong market demand for the ACTIS ® stem and enabling technologies – KINCISE™ and VELYS™ Hip Navigation. The decline in knees was driven by the negative impact of COVID-19. The decline in Trauma was driven by the negative impact of COVID-19 partially offset by strength from new products. The decline in Spine, Sports & Other was driven by the negative impact of COVID-19 partially offset by the uptake of new products. The Vision franchise sales were of $3.9 billion in 2020, a decrease of 15.2% from 2019. The  Contact Lenses/Other operational decline was due to the negative impact of COVID-19. The Surgical operational decline was primarily driven by the negative impact of COVID-19 and competitive pressures in the U.S. The Interventional Solutions franchise achieved sales of $3.0 billion in 2020, an increase of 1.6% from 2019. Growth in the electrophysiology business was driven by Atrial Fibrillation procedure growth coupled with strength from new products and market recovery offsetting negative impacts from COVID-19. 25 Analysis of Consolidated Earnings Before Provision for Taxes on Income Consolidated earnings before provision for taxes on income was $16.5 billion and $17.3 billion for the years 2020 and 2019, respectively. As a percent to sales, consolidated earnings before provision for taxes on income was 20.0% and 21.1%, in 2020 and 2019, respectively. (Dollars in billions. Percentages in chart are as a percent to total sales) Cost of Products Sold and Selling, Marketing and Administrative Expenses: (Dollars in billions. Percentages in chart are as a percent to total sales) Cost of products sold increased as a percent to sales driven by: • Medical Device idle capacity costs associated with COVID-19 related production slow downs • Establishment of obsolescence reserves and fixed cost deleveraging associated with the impact of COVID-19 in the Medical Devices business • Supply chain costs associated with the development of the COVID-19 vaccine in the Pharmaceutical business partially offset by: • Favorable mix within the Pharmaceutical business • Favorable product mix with a higher percentage of sales coming from the Pharmaceutical business The intangible asset amortization expense included in cost of products sold was $4.7 billion and $4.5 billion, for the years 2020 and 2019, respectively.

In-Process Research and Development (IPR&D): In fiscal year 2020, the Company recorded an IPR&D charge of $0.2 billion primarily related to a partial impairment due to timing and progression of one of the digital surgery platforms acquired with the Auris Health acquisition. In the fiscal year 2019, the Company recorded an IPR&D charge of $0.9 billion for the remaining intangible asset value related to the development program of AL-8176, an investigational drug for the treatment of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) acquired with the 2014 acquisition of Alios Biopharma Inc. The impairment charge was based on additional information, including clinical data, which became available and led to the Company's decision to abandon the development of AL-8176. Other (Income) Expense, Net: Other (income) expense, net is the account where the Company records gains and losses related to the sale and write-down of certain investments in equity securities held by Johnson & Johnson Innovation - JJDC, Inc. (JJDC), unrealized gains and losses on investments, gains and losses on divestitures, certain transactional currency gains and losses, acquisition-related costs, litigation accruals and settlements, as well as royalty income. Other (income) expense, net for the fiscal year 2020 was unfavorable by $0.4 billion as compared to the prior year primarily due to the following: (Dollars in Billions)(Income)/Expense 2020 2019 Change Litigation expense (1) $ 5.1 5.1 — Acquisition and Integration related (2) (1.1) 0.3 (1.4) Unrealized (gains)/losses on securities (0.5) (0.6) 0.1 Equity step-up gain related to DR.

(2) 2020 is primarily driven by a contingent consideration reversal of approximately $1.1 billion related to the timing of certain developmental milestones associated with the Auris Health acquisition. (3) 2019 included the divestiture of ASP Interest (Income) Expense: The fiscal year 2020 included net interest expense of $90 million as compared to income of $39 million in the fiscal year 2019. This was primarily due to reduced interest income resulting from lower rates of interest earned on cash balances and a higher average debt balance. This was partially offset by a lower average debt interest rate and a higher average cash balance. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $25.2 billion at the end of 2020, and averaged $22.2 billion as compared to the cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities total of $19.3 billion and $19.5 billion average cash balance in 2019. The total debt balance at the end of 2020 was $35.3 billion with an average debt balance of $31.5 billion as compared to $27.7 billion at the end of 2019 and an average debt balance of $29.1 billion.

Consumer Health Segment: In 2020, the Consumer Health segment loss before tax as a percent of sales was (7.6)% versus income before tax of 14.8% in 2019. The decrease in the income before tax as a percent of sales was primarily driven by the following: • Higher litigation expense of $3.9 billion in 2020 vs. $0.4 billion in 2019 (primarily associated with talc related reserves and certain settlements) • The fiscal year 2019 included a gain of $0.3 billion related to the Company's previously held equity investment in DR. CI:LABO partially offset by: • Portfolio and investment optimization including execution of the ongoing SKU rationalization program Pharmaceutical Segment: In 2020, the Pharmaceutical segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 33.9% versus 20.9% in 2019. The increase in the income before tax as a percent of sales was primarily driven by the following: • Lower litigation expense of $0.8 billion in 2020 vs. $4.3 billion in 2019 (primarily related to the agreement in principle to settle opioid litigation, of which $1.0 billion is in 2020 and $4.0 billion is in 2019) • An in-process research and development charge of $0.9 billion in fiscal 2019 related to Alios • Lower acquisition and integration related costs in fiscal 2020 • Leveraging in selling, marketing and administrative expense Medical Devices Segment: In 2020, the Medical Devices segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 13.3% versus 28.1% in 2019. The decrease in the income before tax as a percent to sales was primarily driven by the following: • A gain of $2.0 billion related to the ASP divestiture recorded in the fiscal 2019 • Idle capacity costs associated with COVID-19 related production slow downs in fiscal 2020 • Establishment of obsolescence reserves and fixed cost deleveraging associated with the impact of COVID-19 in fiscal 2020 • The negative impact of COVID-19 on sales in fiscal 2020 28 • An in-process research and development charge of $0.2 billion in fiscal 2020 primarily related to the Auris Health acquisition partially offset by: • A contingent consideration reversal of approximately $1.1 billion in fiscal 2020 related to the timing of certain developmental milestones associated with the Auris Health acquisition • Litigation expense was $0.3 billion in 2020 vs. $0.4 billion in 2019 Restructuring: In the fiscal second quarter of 2018, the Company announced plans to implement actions across its global supply chain that are intended to enable the Company to focus resources and increase investments in critical capabilities, technologies and solutions necessary to manufacture and supply its product portfolio of the future, enhance agility and drive growth. The Company expects these supply chain actions will include expanding its use of strategic collaborations, and bolstering its initiatives to reduce complexity, improving cost-competitiveness, enhancing capabilities and optimizing its network.  Discussions regarding specific future actions are ongoing and are subject to all relevant consultation requirements before they are finalized. In total, the Company expects these actions to generate approximately $0.6 to $0.8 billion in annual pre-tax cost savings that will be substantially delivered by 2022. The Company expects to record pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $1.9 to $2.3 billion. The Company estimates that approximately 70% of the cumulative pre-tax costs will result in cash outlays. In 2020, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $0.4 billion, which is included on the following lines of the Consolidated Statement of Earnings, $0.2 billion in restructuring, $0.1 billion in other (income) expense and $0.1 billion in cost of products sold. Total project costs of approximately $1.3 billion have been recorded since the restructuring was announced. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to the restructuring programs. Provision for Taxes on Income: The worldwide effective income tax rate was 10.8% in 2020 and 12.7% in 2019. During the fiscal first quarter of 2021, the Internal Revenue Service published final regulations addressing the requirements for tax deductibility of settlement payments. The Company recorded a pre-tax reserve for $4.0 billion in the fiscal year 2019 based on the agreement in principle to settle opioid litigation and recorded an additional pre-tax $1.0 billion in the fiscal third quarter of 2020 upon which an effective rate of 21.4% has been applied. For discussion related to the fiscal 2020 provision for taxes refer to Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

As of January 3, 2021, the net debt position was $10.1 billion as compared to the prior year of $8.4 billion. There was an increase in the net debt position due to increased borrowings in the fiscal third quarter of 2020. The debt balance at the end of 2020 was $35.3 billion as compared to $27.7 billion in 2019. Considering recent market conditions and the on-going COVID-19 crisis, the Company has evaluated its operating cash flows and liquidity profile and does not foresee any significant incremental risk. The Company anticipates that operating cash flows, the ability to raise funds from external sources, borrowing capacity from existing committed credit facilities and access to the commercial paper markets will continue to provide sufficient resources to fund operating needs, including the talc litigation and agreement in principle to settle opioid litigation of which the majority may be paid over the next two to three years. In addition, the Company monitors the global capital markets on an ongoing basis and from time to time may raise capital when market conditions are favorable. In the fiscal 30 third quarter of 2020, the Company issued approximately $5.0 billion of commercial paper, with approximately $0.8 billion outstanding at year end.  In the fiscal third quarter of 2020, the Company issued senior unsecured notes for a total of $7.5 billion.  For additional details on borrowings, see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The net proceeds from this offering were used to fund the Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. acquisition which closed on October 1, 2020 and for general corporate purposes . Additionally, as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), the Company has access to its cash outside the U.S. at a significantly reduced cost. The following table summarizes the Company’s material contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as of January 3, 2021: To satisfy these obligations, the Company intends to use cash from operations.

The table does not include activity related to business combinations or the Company’s approximate $0.9 billion in contractual supply commitments associated with its development of a COVID-19 vaccine. Financing and Market Risk The Company uses financial instruments to manage the impact of foreign exchange rate changes on cash flows. Accordingly, the Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to protect the value of certain foreign currency assets and liabilities and to hedge future foreign currency transactions primarily related to product costs. Gains or losses on these contracts are offset by the gains or losses on the underlying transactions. A 10% appreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the January 3, 2021 market rates would increase the unrealized value of the Company’s forward contracts by $121 million.  Conversely, a 10% depreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the January 3, 2021 market rates would decrease the unrealized value of the Company’s forward contracts by $148 million. In either scenario, the gain or loss on the forward contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction, and therefore, would have no impact on future anticipated earnings and cash flows. The Company hedges the exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and the effect on certain assets and liabilities in foreign currency, by entering into currency swap contracts. A 1% change in the spread between U.S. and foreign interest rates on the Company’s interest rate sensitive financial instruments would either increase or decrease the unrealized value of the Company’s swap contracts by approximately $1,667 million. In either scenario, at maturity, the gain or loss on the swap contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction, and therefore, would have no impact on future anticipated cash flows. The Company does not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Further, the Company has a policy of only entering into contracts with parties that have at least an investment grade credit rating. The counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions and there is no significant concentration of exposure with any one counterparty. Management believes the risk of loss is remote. The Company entered into credit support agreements (CSA) with certain derivative counterparties establishing collateral thresholds based on respective credit ratings and netting agreements. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on credit support agreements. The Company invests in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities which carry a degree of interest rate risk. The fair market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall. A 1% (100 basis points) change in spread on the Company’s interest rate sensitive investments would either increase or decrease the unrealized value of cash equivalents and current marketable securities by approximately $36 million. The Company has access to substantial sources of funds at numerous banks worldwide. In September 2020, the Company secured a new 364-day Credit Facility. Total credit available to the Company approximates $10 billion, which expires on September 9, 2021.  Interest charged on borrowings under the credit line agreement is based on either bids provided by banks, London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR), Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) Swap Curve or other applicable market rate as allowed plus applicable margins. Commitment fees under the agreement are not material. 31 Total borrowings at the end of 2020 and 2019 were $35.3 billion and $27.7 billion, respectively. The increase in borrowings was the issuance of notes in 2020 when market conditions were favorable. In 2020, net debt (cash and current marketable securities, net of debt) was $10.1 billion compared to net debt of $8.4 billion in 2019. Total debt represented 35.8% of total capital (shareholders’ equity and total debt) in 2020 and 31.8% of total capital in 2019. Shareholders’ equity per share at the end of 2020 was $24.04 compared to $22.59 at year-end 2019. A summary of borrowings can be found in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Dividends The Company increased its dividend in 2020 for the 58th consecutive year. Cash dividends paid were $3.98 per share in 2020 and $3.75 per share in 2019. On January 4, 2021, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $1.01 per share, payable on March 9, 2021 to shareholders of record as of February 23, 2021.
