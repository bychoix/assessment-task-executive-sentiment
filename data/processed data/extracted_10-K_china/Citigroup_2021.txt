We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Change in Accounting Principle As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has changed its method of accounting for the recognition and measurement of credit losses as of January 1, 2020 due to the adoption of ASC Topic 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses. Basis for Opinions The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying management's annual report on internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 132 Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Assessment of the fair value of Level 3 assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis As described in Notes 1, 24 and 25 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis were $918.1 billion and $308.8. billion, respectively at December 31, 2020. The Company estimated the fair value of Level 3 assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis ($16.1 billion and $36.0 billion, respectively at December 31, 2020) utilizing various valuation techniques with one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers being unobservable including, but not limited to, complex internal valuation models, alternative pricing procedures or comparables analysis and discounted cash flows. We identified the assessment of the measurement of fair value for Level 3 assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis as a critical audit matter. A high degree of audit effort, including specialized skills and knowledge, and subjective and complex auditor judgment was involved in the assessment of the Level 3 fair values due to measurement uncertainty. Specifically, the assessment encompassed the evaluation of the fair value methodology, including methods, models and significant assumptions and inputs used to estimate fair value. Significant assumptions and inputs include interest rate, price, yield, credit spread, volatilities, correlations and forward prices. The assessment also included an evaluation of the conceptual soundness and performance of the valuation models. The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge who assisted in evaluating the design and testing the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the Company’s Level 3 fair value measurements including controls over: • valuation methodologies, including significant inputs and assumptions • independent price verification • evaluating that significant model assumptions and inputs reflected those which a market participant would use to determine an exit price in the current market environment • the valuation models used were mathematically accurate and appropriate to value the financial instruments • relevant information used within the Company’s models that was reasonably available was considered in the fair value determination. We evaluated the Company’s methodology for compliance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge who assisted in developing an independent fair value estimate for a selection of certain Level 3 assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis based on independently developed valuation models and assumptions, as applicable, using market data sources we determined to be relevant and reliable and compared our independent expectation to the Company’s fair value measurements. Assessment of the allowance for credit losses collectively evaluated for impairment As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (ASC 326) as of January 1, 2020. As discussed in Notes 1 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s allowance for credit losses related to loans and unfunded lending commitments collectively evaluated for impairment (the collective ACLL) was $27.6 billion as of December 31, 2020. The expected credit losses for the quantitative component of the collective ACLL is the product of multiplying the probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD), and exposure at default (EAD) for consumer and corporate loans. For consumer credit cards, the Company uses the payment rate approach over the life of the loan, which leverages payment rate curves, to determine the payments that should be applied to liquidate the end-of-period balance in the estimation of EAD. For unconditionally cancelable accounts, reserves are based on the expected life of the balance as of the evaluation date and do not include any undrawn commitments that are unconditionally cancelable. The Company’s models utilize a single forward-looking macroeconomic forecast and macroeconomic assumptions over reasonable and supportable forecast periods. Reasonable and supportable forecast periods vary by product. For consumer loan models, the Company uses a 13-quarter reasonable and supportable period and reverts to historical loss experience thereafter. For corporate loan models, the Company uses a nine-quarter reasonable and supportable period followed by a three-quarter transition to historical loss experience. Additionally, for consumer loans, these models consider leading credit indicators including loan delinquencies, as well as economic factors. For corporate loans, these models consider the credit quality as measured by risk ratings and economic factors. The qualitative component considers idiosyncratic events and the uncertainty of forward-looking economic scenarios. 133 We identified the assessment of the collective ACLL as a critical audit matter. The assessment involved significant measurement uncertainty requiring complex auditor judgment, and specialized skills and knowledge as well as experience in the industry. This assessment encompassed the evaluation of the various components of the collective ACLL methodology, including the methods and models used to estimate the PD, LGD, and EAD and certain key assumptions and inputs for the Company’s quantitative and qualitative components. Key assumptions and inputs for consumer loans included loan delinquencies, certain credit indicators, reasonable and supportable forecast periods, expected life as well as economic factors, including unemployment rates, gross domestic product (GDP), and housing prices which are considered in the model. For corporate loans, key assumptions and inputs included risk ratings, reasonable and supportable forecasts, credit conversion factor for unfunded lending commitments, and economic factors, including GDP and unemployment rates considered in the model. Key assumptions and inputs for the qualitative component included the likelihood and severity of a downside scenario and consideration of uncertainties due to idiosyncratic events as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The assessment also included an evaluation of the conceptual soundness and performance of the PD, LGD, and EAD models. In addition, auditor judgment was required to evaluate the sufficiency of audit evidence obtained. The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the Company’s measurement of the collective ACLL estimate, including controls over the: • approval of the collective ACLL methodologies • determination of the key assumptions and inputs used to estimate the quantitative and qualitative components of the collective ACLL • performance monitoring of the PD, LGD, and EAD models. We evaluated the Company’s process to develop the collective ACLL estimate by testing certain sources of data, factors and assumptions that the Company used and considered the relevance and reliability of such data, factors, and assumptions. In addition, we involved credit risk professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in: • reviewing the Company’s collective ACLL methodologies and key assumptions for compliance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles • evaluating judgments made by the Company relative to the development and performance monitoring testing of the PD, LGD, and EAD models by comparing them to relevant Company-specific metrics • assessing the conceptual soundness and performance testing of the PD, LGD, and EAD models by inspecting the model documentation to determine whether the models are suitable for their intended use • assessing the economic forecast scenarios through comparison to publicly available forecasts • evaluating the methodology used to develop certain economic forecast scenarios by comparing it to relevant industry practices • testing corporate loan risk ratings for a selection of borrowers by evaluating the financial performance of the borrower, sources of repayment, and any relevant guarantees or underlying collateral • evaluating the methodology used in determining the qualitative components and the effect of that component on the collective ACLL compared with relevant credit risk factors and consistency with credit trends. We also assessed the sufficiency of the audit evidence obtained related to the collective ACLL by evaluating the: • cumulative results of the audit procedures • qualitative aspects of the Company’s accounting practices • potential bias in the accounting estimates. Assessment of the realizability of deferred tax assets, specifically as it relates to general basket foreign tax credits As discussed in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s net deferred tax assets (DTA) were $31.0 billion as of December 31, 2020. This balance is net of a valuation allowance of $5.2 billion recorded by the Company. The estimation of the DTA for general basket foreign tax credits (FTCs) and related valuation allowance was $5.3 billion and $1.0 billion respectively. The Company evaluated the realization of the DTA for general basket FTCs to determine whether there was more than a 50% likelihood that the DTA for general basket FTCs would be realized, based primarily on the Company’s expectations of future taxable income in each relevant jurisdiction, available tax planning strategies and timing of tax credit expirations. In particular, the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected the economy and business activities in countries where the Company operates, which has impacted the Company’s future forecasts of taxable income as of December 31, 2020. We identified the assessment of the realizability of the DTA for general basket FTCs as a critical audit matter. Due to the significant measurement uncertainty associated with the realizability of the DTA for general basket FTCs, there was a high degree of subjectivity and judgment in evaluating global tax regulations and future taxable income. This assessment encompassed the evaluation of the Company’s estimations that are subjective and complex due to its global structure, given the Company’s assumptions used to determine that sufficient taxable income will be generated or tax planning strategies implemented to support the realization 134 of the DTA for general basket FTCs before expiration of foreign tax credits. The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain controls related to the Company’s DTA realizability process, including controls over the: • realizability of the Company’s deferred tax assets for general basket FTCs • appropriateness of future taxable income and tax planning strategies. We tested the Company’s process to develop the valuation allowance estimate. This included performing an assessment of the policy and methodology used by management in the valuation allowance determination. We involved income tax professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in assessing: • certain assumptions used to determine the Company’s future taxable income, including the interpretation of the various tax laws and regulations and the source and character of future taxable income • the timing of tax credit expirations • the prudence and feasibility of certain tax planning strategies. We performed sensitivity analyses over the Company’s expectations of future taxable income and timing of tax credit expirations. Evaluation of goodwill in the North American and Asia Global Consumer Banking reporting units As discussed in Notes 1 and 16 to the consolidated financial statements, the goodwill balance as of December 31, 2020 was $22.2 billion, of which $12.1 billion related to reporting units within the Global Consumer Banking segment and $10.1 billion related to reporting units within the Institutional Clients Group segment. The Company performs goodwill impairment testing on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit likely exceeds its fair value. This involves estimating the fair value of the reporting units using both discounted cash flow analyses and a market multiples approach. The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected the economy and business activities in countries where the Company operates, which impacted the Company’s future forecasts used in the discounted cash flow analyses. We identified the evaluation of the goodwill impairment analysis for the North America Global Consumer Banking and Asia Global Consumer Banking reporting units, two of the three reporting units within the Global Consumer Banking segment, as a critical audit matter. The estimated fair value of the North America and Asia Global Consumer Banking reporting units marginally exceeded their carrying values, indicating a higher risk due to measurement uncertainty that the goodwill may be impaired and, therefore, involved a high degree of subjective auditor judgment. Specifically, the assessment encompassed the evaluation of the key assumptions used in estimating the fair value of the North America and Asia Global Consumer Banking reporting units, which include the long-term growth rate, discount rate, exit multiple assumptions, certain forecasted macroeconomic assumptions used to inform the forecasted income by reporting unit, and certain assumptions used to forecast income by reporting unit including the forecast period, net interest revenue, and loan volume used in the discounted cash flow analyses. The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the Company’s determination of the estimated fair value of the North America Global Consumer Banking and Asia Global Consumer Banking reporting units, including controls related to management’s process for assessing the appropriateness of: • certain assumptions including the long-term growth rate, discount rate and exit multiple used in the discounted cash flow analyses • certain forecasted macroeconomic assumptions used to inform the forecasted income by reporting unit • certain assumptions used to forecast income by reporting unit including the forecast period, net interest revenue and loan volume. 135 We compared the Company’s historical revenue forecasts to actual results to assess the Company’s ability to accurately forecast. We evaluated the reasonableness of the Company’s forecasts by comparing to analyst reports. In addition, we involved a valuation professional with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in: • developing an independent range of long-term growth rate assumptions by reviewing publicly available data for the United States and Asian markets and comparable industries and comparing it to the Company’s assumption • evaluating the discount rate by assessing the methodology used by management and developing an independent assumption for the discount rate • developing an independent range of the exit assumptions using publicly available data for comparable entities and comparing it to the Company’s assumption • developing an estimate of the fair value of North America and Asia Global Consumer Banking reporting units using the income approach and comparing the results to the Company’s fair value estimate • developing an independent range of control premium assumptions by comparing data from the 2008-2009 financial crisis to the Company’s assumption • assessing the market capitalization reconciliation and the reasonableness of the implied control premium. /s/ KPMG LLP We have served as the Company’s auditor since 1969.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Throughout these Notes, “Citigroup,” “Citi” and the “Company” refer to Citigroup Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. Certain reclassifications, have been made to the prior periods’ financial statements and disclosures to conform to the current period’s presentation. For information on Citi’s recent revisions and reclassifications related to the accounting principle change for variable post-charge-off third-party collection costs, see below and Notes 15 and 30 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Principles of Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Citigroup and its subsidiaries prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The Company consolidates subsidiaries in which it holds, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the voting rights or where it exercises control. Entities where the Company holds 20% to 50% of the voting rights and/or has the ability to exercise significant influence, other than investments of designated venture capital subsidiaries or investments accounted for at fair value under the fair value option, are accounted for under the equity method, and the pro rata share of their income (loss) is included in Other revenue . Income from investments in less-than- 20 %-owned companies is recognized when dividends are received. As discussed in more detail in Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Citigroup also consolidates entities deemed to be variable interest entities when Citigroup is determined to be the primary beneficiary. Gains and losses on the disposition of branches, subsidiaries, affiliates, buildings and other investments are included in Other revenue . Citibank Citibank, N.A. (Citibank) is a commercial bank and wholly owned subsidiary of Citigroup. Citibank’s principal offerings include consumer finance, mortgage lending and retail banking (including commercial banking) products and services; investment banking, cash management and trade finance; and private banking products and services. Variable Interest Entities (VIEs) An entity is a variable interest entity (VIE) if it meets either of the criteria outlined in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 810, Consolidation , which are (i) the entity has equity that is insufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties, or (ii) the entity has equity investors that cannot make significant decisions about the entity’s operations or that do not absorb their proportionate share of the entity’s expected losses or expected returns. The Company consolidates a VIE when it has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and a right to receive benefits or the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could be potentially significant to the VIE (that is, Citi is the primary beneficiary). In addition to variable interests held in consolidated VIEs, the Company has variable interests in other VIEs that are not consolidated because the Company is not the primary beneficiary. All unconsolidated VIEs are monitored by the Company to assess whether any events have occurred to cause its primary beneficiary status to change. All entities not deemed to be VIEs with which the Company has involvement are evaluated for consolidation under other subtopics of ASC 810. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information. Foreign Currency Translation Assets and liabilities of Citi’s foreign operations are translated from their respective functional currencies into U.S. dollars using period-end spot foreign exchange rates. The effects of those translation adjustments are reported in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) , a component of stockholders’ equity, net of any related hedge and tax effects, until realized upon sale or substantial liquidation of the foreign operation, at which point such amounts related to the foreign entity are reclassified into earnings. Revenues and expenses of Citi’s foreign operations are translated monthly from their respective functional currencies into U.S. dollars at amounts that approximate weighted average exchange rates. For transactions that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency, including transactions denominated in the local currencies of foreign operations that use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, the effects of changes in exchange rates are primarily included in Principal transactions , along with the related effects of any economic hedges. Instruments used to hedge foreign currency exposures include foreign currency forward, option and swap contracts and, in certain instances, designated issues of non-U.S. dollar debt. Foreign operations in countries with highly inflationary economies designate the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, with the effects of changes in exchange rates primarily included in Other revenue . Investment Securities Investments include debt and equity securities. Debt securities include bonds, notes and redeemable preferred stocks, as well as certain loan-backed and structured securities that are subject to prepayment risk. Equity securities include common and nonredeemable preferred stock. Debt Securities • Debt securities classified as “held-to-maturity” are securities that the Company has both the ability and the intent to hold until maturity and are carried at amortized cost. Interest income on such securities is included in Interest revenue . • Debt securities classified as “available-for-sale” are carried at fair value with changes in fair value reported in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) , a 146 component of stockholders’ equity, net of applicable income taxes and hedges. Interest income on such securities is included in Interest revenue . Equity Securities • Marketable equity securities are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. • Non-marketable equity securities are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings unless (i) the measurement alternative is elected or (ii) the investment represents Federal Reserve Bank and Federal Home Loan Bank stock or certain exchange seats that continue to be carried at cost. Non-marketable equity securities under the measurement alternative are carried at cost plus or minus changes resulting from observed prices for orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. • Certain investments that would otherwise have been accounted for using the equity method are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings, since the Company elected to apply fair value accounting. For investments in debt securities classified as HTM or AFS, the accrual of interest income is suspended for investments that are in default or for which it is likely that future interest payments will not be made as scheduled. Debt securities not measured at fair value through earnings include securities held in HTM or AFS, and equity securities accounted for under the Measurement Alternative or equity method. These securities are subject to evaluation for impairment as described in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for HTM securities and in Note 13 for AFS, Measurement Alternative and equity method investments. Realized gains and losses on sales of investments are included in earnings, primarily on a specific identification basis. The Company uses a number of valuation techniques for investments carried at fair value, which are described in Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Trading Account Assets and Liabilities Trading account assets include debt and marketable equity securities, derivatives in a receivable position, residual interests in securitizations and physical commodities inventory. In addition, as described in Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, certain assets that Citigroup has elected to carry at fair value under the fair value option, such as loans and purchased guarantees, are also included in Trading account assets . Trading account liabilities include securities sold, not yet purchased (short positions) and derivatives in a net payable position, as well as certain liabilities that Citigroup has elected to carry at fair value (as described in Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Other than physical commodities inventory, all trading account assets and liabilities are carried at fair value. Revenues generated from trading assets and trading liabilities are generally reported in Principal transactions and include realized gains and losses as well as unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair value of such instruments. Interest income on trading assets is recorded in Interest revenue reduced by interest expense on trading liabilities. Physical commodities inventory is carried at the lower of cost or market with related losses reported in Principal transactions . Realized gains and losses on sales of commodities inventory are included in Principal transactions . Investments in unallocated precious metals accounts (gold, silver, platinum and palladium) are accounted for as hybrid instruments containing a debt host contract and an embedded non-financial derivative instrument indexed to the price of the relevant precious metal. The embedded derivative instrument is separated from the debt host contract and accounted for at fair value. The debt host contract is carried at fair value under the fair value option, as described in Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Derivatives used for trading purposes include interest rate, currency, equity, credit and commodity swap agreements, options, caps and floors, warrants, and financial and commodity futures and forward contracts. Derivative asset and liability positions are presented net by counterparty on the Consolidated Balance Sheet when a valid master netting agreement exists and the other conditions set out in ASC Topic 210-20, Balance Sheet—Offsetting , are met. See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company uses a number of techniques to determine the fair value of trading assets and liabilities, which are described in Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Securities Borrowed and Securities Loaned Securities borrowing and lending transactions do not constitute a sale of the underlying securities for accounting purposes and are treated as collateralized financing transactions. Such transactions are recorded at the amount of proceeds advanced or received plus accrued interest. As described in Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has elected to apply fair value accounting to a number of securities borrowing and lending transactions. Fees paid or received for all securities lending and borrowing transactions are recorded in Interest expense or Interest revenue at the contractually specified rate. The Company monitors the fair value of securities borrowed or loaned on a daily basis and obtains or posts additional collateral in order to maintain contractual margin protection. As described in Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company uses a discounted cash flow technique to determine the fair value of securities lending and borrowing transactions. Repurchase and Resale Agreements Securities sold under agreements to repurchase (repos) and securities purchased under agreements to resell (reverse repos) do not constitute a sale (or purchase) of the underlying securities for accounting purposes and are treated as collateralized financing transactions. As described in Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has elected to apply fair value accounting to certain of such transactions, with changes in fair value reported in earnings. Any transactions for which fair value accounting has not been 147 elected are recorded at the amount of cash advanced or received plus accrued interest. Irrespective of whether the Company has elected fair value accounting, interest paid or received on all repo and reverse repo transactions is recorded in Interest expense or Interest revenue at the contractually specified rate. Where the conditions of ASC 210-20-45-11, Balance Sheet—Offsetting: Repurchase and Reverse Repurchase Agreements , are met, repos and reverse repos are presented net on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company’s policy is to take possession of securities purchased under reverse repurchase agreements. The Company monitors the fair value of securities subject to repurchase or resale on a daily basis and obtains or posts additional collateral in order to maintain contractual margin protection. As described in Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company uses a discounted cash flow technique to determine the fair value of repo and reverse repo transactions. Loans Loans are reported at their outstanding principal balances net of any unearned income and unamortized deferred fees and costs, except for credit card receivable balances, which include accrued interest and fees. Loan origination fees and certain direct origination costs are generally deferred and recognized as adjustments to income over the lives of the related loans. As described in Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Citi has elected fair value accounting for certain loans. Such loans are carried at fair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings. Interest income on such loans is recorded in Interest revenue at the contractually specified rate. Loans that are held-for-investment are classified as Loans, net of unearned income on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and the related cash flows are included within the cash flows from investing activities category in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows on the line Change in loans . However, when the initial intent for holding a loan has changed from held-for-investment to held-for-sale (HFS), the loan is reclassified to HFS, but the related cash flows continue to be reported in cash flows from investing activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows on the line Proceeds from sales and securitizations of loans . Consumer Loans Consumer loans represent loans and leases managed primarily by the Global Consumer Banking (GCB) businesses and Corporate/Other . Consumer Non-accrual and Re-aging Policies As a general rule, interest accrual ceases for installment and real estate (both open- and closed-end) loans when payments are 90 days contractually past due. For credit cards and other unsecured revolving loans, however, Citi generally accrues interest until payments are 180 days past due. As a result of OCC guidance, home equity loans in regulated bank entities are classified as non-accrual if the related residential first mortgage is 90 days or more past due. Also as a result of OCC guidance, mortgage loans in regulated bank entities are classified as non-accrual within 60 days of notification that the borrower has filed for bankruptcy, other than Federal Housing Administration (FHA)-insured loans. Loans that have been modified to grant a concession to a borrower in financial difficulty may not be accruing interest at the time of the modification. The policy for returning such modified loans to accrual status varies by product and/or region. In most cases, a minimum number of payments (ranging from one to six ) is required, while in other cases the loan is never returned to accrual status. For regulated bank entities, such modified loans are returned to accrual status if a credit evaluation at the time of, or subsequent to, the modification indicates the borrower is able to meet the restructured terms, and the borrower is current and has demonstrated a reasonable period of sustained payment performance (minimum six months of consecutive payments). For U.S. consumer loans, generally one of the conditions to qualify for modification (other than for loan modifications made through the CARES Act relief provisions or banking agency guidance for pandemic-related issues) is that a minimum number of payments (typically ranging from one to three ) must be made. Upon modification, the loan is re-aged to current status. However, re-aging practices for certain open-ended consumer loans, such as credit cards, are governed by Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) guidelines. For open-ended consumer loans subject to FFIEC guidelines, one of the conditions for the loan to be re-aged to current status is that at least three consecutive minimum monthly payments, or the equivalent amount, must be received. In addition, under FFIEC guidelines, the number of times that such a loan can be re-aged is subject to limitations (generally once in 12 months and twice in five years). Furthermore, FHA and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) loans may only be modified under those respective agencies’ guidelines, and payments are not always required in order to re-age a modified loan to current. Consumer Charge-Off Policies Citi’s charge-off policies follow the general guidelines below: • Unsecured installment loans are charged off at 120 days contractually past due. • Unsecured revolving loans and credit card loans are charged off at 180 days contractually past due. • Loans secured with non-real estate collateral are written down to the estimated value of the collateral, less costs to sell, at 120 days contractually past due. • Real estate-secured loans are written down to the estimated value of the property, less costs to sell, at 180 days contractually past due. • Real estate-secured loans are charged off no later than 180 days contractually past due if a decision has been made not to foreclose on the loans. • Unsecured loans in bankruptcy are charged off within 60 days of notification of filing by the bankruptcy court or in accordance with Citi’s charge-off policy, whichever occurs earlier. • Real estate-secured loans in bankruptcy, other than FHA-insured loans, are written down to the estimated value of the property, less costs to sell, within 60 days of 148 notification that the borrower has filed for bankruptcy or in accordance with Citi’s charge-off policy, whichever is earlier. Corporate Loans Corporate loans represent loans and leases managed by Institutional Clients Group ( ICG ). Corporate loans are identified as impaired and placed on a cash (non-accrual) basis when it is determined, based on actual experience and a forward-looking assessment of the collectability of the loan in full, that the payment of interest or principal is doubtful or when interest or principal is 90 days past due, except when the loan is well collateralized and in the process of collection. Any interest accrued on impaired corporate loans and leases is reversed at 90 days past due and charged against current earnings, and interest is thereafter included in earnings only to the extent actually received in cash. When there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectability of principal, all cash receipts are thereafter applied to reduce the recorded investment in the loan. Impaired corporate loans and leases are written down to the extent that principal is deemed to be uncollectible. Impaired collateral-dependent loans and leases, where repayment is expected to be provided solely by the sale of the underlying collateral and there are no other available and reliable sources of repayment, are written down to the lower of carrying value or collateral value. Cash-basis loans are returned to accrual status when all contractual principal and interest amounts are reasonably assured of repayment and there is a sustained period of repayment performance in accordance with the contractual terms. Loans Held-for-Sale Corporate and consumer loans that have been identified for sale are classified as loans HFS and included in Other assets . The practice of Citi’s U.S. prime mortgage business has been to sell substantially all of its conforming loans. As such, U.S. prime mortgage conforming loans are classified as HFS and the fair value option is elected at origination, with changes in fair value recorded in Other revenue . With the exception of those loans for which the fair value option has been elected, HFS loans are accounted for at the lower of cost or market value, with any write-downs or subsequent recoveries charged to Other revenue . The related cash flows are classified in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows in the cash flows from operating activities category on the line Change in loans held-for-sale . Allowances for Credit Losses (ACL) Commencing January 1, 2020, Citi adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASC) 326, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses , using the methodologies described below. For information about Citi’s accounting for loan losses prior to January 1, 2020, see “Superseded Accounting Principles” below. The current expected credit losses (CECL) methodology is based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable (R&S) forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported financial asset balances. If the asset’s life extends beyond the R&S forecast period, then historical experience is considered over the remaining life of the assets in the ACL. The resulting ACL is adjusted in each subsequent reporting period through Provisions for credit losses in the Consolidated Statement of Income to reflect changes in history, current conditions and forecasts as well as changes in asset positions and portfolios. ASC 326 defines the ACL as a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost of a financial asset to present the net amount that management expects to collect on the financial asset over its expected life. All financial assets carried at amortized cost are in the scope of ASC 326, while assets measured at fair value are excluded. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of impairment on available-for-sale (AFS) securities. Increases and decreases to the allowances are recorded in Provisions for credit losses . The CECL methodology utilizes a lifetime expected credit loss (ECL) measurement objective for the recognition of credit losses for held-for-investment (HFI) loans, held-to-maturity (HTM) debt securities, receivables and other financial assets measured at amortized cost at the time the financial asset is originated or acquired. Within the life of a loan or other financial asset, the methodology generally results in the earlier recognition of the provision for credit losses and the related ACL than prior U.S. GAAP. Estimation of ECLs requires Citi to make assumptions regarding the likelihood and severity of credit loss events and their impact on expected cash flows, which drive the probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD) and exposure at default (EAD) models and, where Citi discounts the ECL, using discounting techniques for certain products. Where the asset’s life extends beyond the R&S forecast period, Citi considers historical experience over the remaining life of the assets in estimating the ACL. Citi uses a multitude of variables in its macroeconomic forecast as part of its calculation of both the qualitative and quantitative components of the ACL, including both domestic and international variables for its global portfolios and exposures. Citi’s forecasts of the U.S. unemployment rate and U.S. Real GDP growth rate represent the key macroeconomic variables that most significantly affect its estimate of its consumer and corporate ACLs. Under the quantitative base scenario, Citi’s 4Q’20 forecasts are for U.S. unemployment to continue to improve as the U.S. moves past the peak of the health and economic crisis. The downside scenario incorporates more adverse economic conditions and subsequently higher unemployment rates and slower GDP recovery. The following are the main factors and interpretations that Citi considers when estimating the ACL under the CECL methodology: • The most important reasons for the 2020 change in the ACL since the adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020 are the pandemic and the resulting economic recessions, which led to higher unemployment and lower GDP forecasts than were expected at the beginning of the year; the impact of government stimulus and relief programs; and portfolio changes and lower loan balances resulting from changed customer spending patterns. 149 • CECL reserves are estimated over the contractual term of the financial asset, which is adjusted for expected prepayments. Expected extensions are generally not considered unless the option to extend the loan cannot be canceled unilaterally by Citi. Modifications are also not considered, unless Citi has a reasonable expectation that it will execute a troubled debt restructuring (TDR). • Credit enhancements that are not freestanding (such as those that are included in the original terms of the contract or those executed in conjunction with the lending transaction) are considered loss mitigants for purposes of CECL reserve estimation. • For unconditionally cancelable accounts such as credit cards, reserves are based on the expected life of the balance as of the evaluation date (assuming no further charges) and do not include any undrawn commitments that are unconditionally cancelable. Reserves are included for undrawn commitments for accounts that are not unconditionally cancelable (such as letters of credit and corporate loan commitments, HELOCs, undrawn mortgage loan commitments and financial guarantees). • CECL models are designed to be economically sensitive. They utilize the macroeconomic forecasts provided by Citi’s economic forecasting team (EFT) that are approved by senior management. Analysis is performed and documented to determine the necessary qualitative management adjustment (QMA) to capture forward-looking macroeconomic expectations and model uncertainty. • The portion of the forecast that reflects the EFT’s reasonable and supportable (R&S) period indicates the maximum length of time its models can produce a R&S macroeconomic forecast, after which mean reversion reflecting historical loss experience is used for the remaining life of the loan to estimate expected credit losses. For the loss forecast, businesses consume the macroeconomic forecast as determined to be appropriate and justifiable. Citi’s ability to forecast credit losses over the reasonable and supportable (R&S) period is based on the ability to forecast economic activity over a reasonable and supportable time window. The R&S period reflects the overall ability to have a reasonable and supportable forecast of credit loss based on economic forecasts. • The loss models consume all or a portion of the R&S economic forecast and then revert to historical loss experience. The R&S forecast period for consumer loans is 13 quarters and, in most cases, reverts to historically based loss experience either immediately or using a straight-line approach thereafter, while the R&S period for wholesale is nine quarters with an additional straight-line  reversion period of three quarters for ECL parameters. • The ACL incorporates provisions for accrued interest on products that are not subject to a non-accrual and timely write-off policy (e.g., cards and Ready Credit, etc.). • The reserves for TDRs are calculated using the discounted cash flow method and consider appropriate macroeconomic forecast data for the exposure type. For TDR loans that are collateral dependent, the ACL is based on the fair value of the collateral. • Citi uses the most recent available information to inform its macroeconomic forecasts, allowing sufficient time for analysis of the results and corresponding approvals. Key variables are reviewed for significant changes through year end and changes to portfolio positions are reflected in the ACL. • Reserves are calculated at an appropriately granular level and on a pooled basis where financial assets share risk characteristics. At a minimum, reserves are calculated at a portfolio level (product and country). Where a financial asset does not share risk characteristics with any of the pools, it is evaluated for credit losses individually. Quantitative and Qualitative Components of the ACL The loss likelihood and severity models use both internal and external information and are sensitive to forecasts of different macroeconomic conditions. For the quantitative component, Citi uses a single forward-looking macroeconomic forecast, complemented by the qualitative component that reflects economic uncertainty due to a different possible more adverse scenario for estimating the ACL. Estimates of these ECLs are based upon (i) Citigroup’s internal system of credit risk ratings; (ii) historical default and loss data, including comprehensive internal history and rating agency information regarding default rates and internal data on the severity of losses in the event of default; and (iii) a R&S forecast of future macroeconomic conditions. ECL is determined primarily by utilizing models for the borrowers’ PD, LGD and EAD. Adjustments may be made to this data, including (i) statistically calculated estimates to cover the historical fluctuation of the default rates over the credit cycle, the historical variability of loss severity among defaulted loans and the degree to which there are large obligor concentrations in the global portfolio, and (ii) adjustments made for specifically known items, such as current environmental factors and credit trends. Any adjustments needed to the modeled expected losses in the quantitative calculations are addressed through a qualitative adjustment. The qualitative adjustment considers, among other things: the uncertainty of forward-looking scenarios based on the likelihood and severity of a possible recession; the uncertainty of economic conditions related to an alternative downside scenario; certain portfolio characteristics and concentrations; collateral coverage; model limitations; idiosyncratic events; and other relevant criteria under banking supervisory guidance for loan loss reserves. The qualitative adjustment also reflects the estimated impact of the pandemic on the economic forecasts and the impact on credit loss estimates. The total ACL is composed of the quantitative and qualitative components. Consumer Loans For consumer loans, most portfolios including North America cards, mortgages and personal installment loans (PILs) are covered by the PD, LGD and EAD loss forecasting models. 150 Some smaller international portfolios are covered by econometric models where the gross credit loss (GCL) rate is forecasted. The modeling of all retail products is performed by examining risk drivers for a given portfolio; these drivers relate to exposures with similar credit risk characteristics and consider past events, current conditions and R&S forecasts. Under the PD x LGD x EAD approach, GCLs and recoveries are captured on an undiscounted basis. Citi incorporates expected recoveries on loans into its reserve estimate, including expected recoveries on assets previously written off. CECL defines the exposure’s expected life as the remaining contractual maturity including any expected prepayments. Subsequent changes to the contractual terms that are the result of a re-underwriting are not included in the loan’s expected CECL life. Citi does not establish reserves for the uncollectible accrued interest on non-revolving consumer products, such as mortgages and installment loans, which are subject to a non-accrual and timely write-off policy. As such, only the principal balance is subject to the CECL reserve methodology and interest does not attract a further reserve. FAS 91-deferred origination costs and fees related to new account originations are amortized within a 12-month period, and an ACL is provided for components in the scope of the ASC. Separate valuation allowances are determined for impaired smaller-balance homogeneous loans whose terms have been modified in a TDR. Long-term modification programs, and short-term (less than 12 months) modifications that provide concessions (such as interest rate reductions) to borrowers in financial difficulty, are reported as TDRs. In addition, loan modifications that involve a trial period are reported as TDRs at the start of the trial period. The ACL for TDRs is determined using a discounted cash flow (DCF) approach. When a DCF approach is used, the initial allowance for ECLs is calculated as the expected contractual cash flows discounted at the loan’s original effective interest rate. DCF techniques are applied only for consumer loans classified as TDR loan exposures. For cards, Citi uses the payment rate approach, which leverages payment rate curves, to determine the payments that should be applied to liquidate the end-of-period balance (CECL balance) in the estimation of EAD. The payment rate approach uses customer payment behavior (payment rate) to establish the portion of the CECL balance that will be paid each month. These payment rates are defined as the percentage of principal payments received in the respective month divided by the prior month’s billed principal balance. The liquidation (CECL payment) amount for each forecast period is determined by multiplying the CECL balance by that period’s forecasted payment rate. The cumulative sum of these payments less the CECL balance produces the balance liquidation curve. Citi does not apply a non-accrual policy to credit card receivables; rather, they are subject to full charge-off at 180 days past due. As such, the entire customer balance up until write-off, including accrued interest and fees, will be subject to the CECL reserve methodology. Corporate Loans and HTM Securities Citi records allowances for credit losses on all financial assets carried at amortized cost that are in the scope of CECL, including corporate loans classified as HFI and HTM debt securities. Discounting techniques are applied for corporate loans classified as HFI and HTM securities and non-accrual/TDR loan exposures. All cash flows are fully discounted to the reporting date. The ACL includes Citi’s estimate of all credit losses expected to be incurred over the estimated full contractual life of the financial asset. The contractual life of the financial asset does not include expected extensions, renewals or modifications, except for instances where the Company reasonably expects to extend the tenor of the financial asset pursuant to a future TDR Where Citi has an unconditional option to extend the contractual term, Citi does not consider the potential extension in determining the contractual term; however, where the borrower has the sole right to exercise the extension option without Citi’s approval, Citi does consider the potential extension in determining the contractual term. The decrease in credit losses under CECL at the date of adoption on January 1, 2020, compared with the prior incurred loss methodology, is largely due to more precise contractual maturities that result in shorter remaining tenors, the incorporation of recoveries and use of more specific historical loss data based on an increase in portfolio segmentation across industries and geographies. The Company primarily bases its ACL on models that assess the likelihood and severity of credit events and their impact on cash flows under R&S forecasted economic scenarios. Allowances consider the probability of the borrower’s default, the loss the Company would incur upon default and the borrower’s exposure at default. Such models discount the present value of all future cash flows, using the asset’s effective interest rate (EIR). Citi applies a more simplified approach based on historical loss rates to certain exposures recorded in Other assets and certain loan exposures in the private bank. The Company considers the risk of nonpayment to be zero for U.S. Treasuries and U.S. government-sponsored agency guaranteed mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and, as such, Citi does not have an ACL for these securities. For all other HTM debt securities, ECLs are estimated using PD models and discounting techniques, which incorporate assumptions regarding the likelihood and severity of credit losses. For structured securities, specific models use relevant assumptions for the underlying collateral type. A discounting approach is applied to HTM direct obligations of a single issuer, similar to that used for corporate HFI loans. Other Financial Assets with Zero Expected Credit Losses For certain financial assets, zero expected credit losses will be recognized where the expectation of nonpayment of the amortized cost basis is zero, based on there being no history of loss and the nature of the receivables. Secured Financing Transactions Most of Citi’s reverse repurchase agreements, securities borrowing arrangements and margin loans require that the borrower continually adjust the amount of the collateral securing Citi’s interest, primarily resulting from changes in the fair value of such collateral. In such arrangements, ACLs are recorded based only on the amount by which the asset’s amortized cost basis exceeds the fair value of the collateral. No ACLs are recorded where the fair value of the collateral is 151 equal to or exceeds the asset’s amortized cost basis, as Citi does not expect to incur credit losses on such well-collateralized exposures. For certain margin loans presented in Loans on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, credit losses are estimated using the same approach as corporate loans. Accrued Interest CECL permits entities to make an accounting policy election not to reserve for interest, if the entity has a policy in place that will result in timely reversal or write-off of interest. However, when a non-accrual or timely charge-off policy is not applied, an ACL is recognized on accrued interest. For HTM debt securities, Citi established a non-accrual policy that results in timely write-off of accrued interest. For corporate loans, where a timely charge-off policy is used, Citi has elected to recognize an ACL on accrued interest receivable. The LGD models for corporate loans include an adjustment for estimated accrued interest. Reasonably Expected TDRs For corporate loans, the reasonable expectation of TDR concept requires that the contractual life over which ECLs are estimated be extended when a TDR that results in a tenor extension is reasonably expected. Reasonably expected TDRs are included in the life of the asset. A discounting technique or collateral-dependent practical expedient is used for non-accrual and TDR loan exposures that do not share risk characteristics with other loans and are individually assessed. Loans modified in accordance with the CARES Act and bank regulatory guidance are not classified as TDRs. Purchased Credit Deteriorated (PCD) Assets ASC 326 requires entities that have acquired financial assets (such as loans and HTM securities) with an intent to hold, to evaluate whether those assets have experienced a more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination. These assets are subject to specialized accounting at initial recognition under CECL. Subsequent measurement of PCD assets will remain consistent with other purchased or originated assets, i.e., non-PCD assets. CECL introduces the notion of PCD assets, which replaces purchased credit impaired (PCI) accounting under prior U.S. GAAP. CECL requires the estimation of credit losses to be performed on a pool basis unless a PCD asset does not share characteristics with any pool. If certain PCD assets do not meet the conditions for aggregation, those PCD assets should be accounted for separately. This determination must be made at the date the PCD asset is purchased. In estimating ECLs from day 2 onward, pools can potentially be reassembled based upon similar risk characteristics. When PCD assets are pooled, Citi determines the amount of the initial ACL at the pool level. The amount of the initial ACL for a PCD asset represents the portion of the total discount at acquisition that relates to credit and is recognized as a “gross-up” of the purchase price to arrive at the PCD asset’s (or pool’s) amortized cost. Any difference between the unpaid principal balance and the amortized cost is considered to be related to non-credit factors and results in a discount or premium, which is amortized to interest income over the life of the individual asset (or pool). Direct expenses incurred related to the acquisition of PCD assets and other assets and liabilities in a business combination are expensed as incurred. Subsequent accounting for acquired PCD assets is the same as the accounting for originated assets; changes in the allowance are recorded in Provisions for credit losses . Consumer Citi does not purchase whole portfolios of PCD assets in its retail businesses. However, there may be a small portion of a purchased portfolio that is identified as PCD at the purchase date. Interest income recognition does not vary between PCD and non-PCD assets. A consumer financial asset is considered to be more-than-insignificantly credit deteriorated if it is more than 30 days past due at the purchase date. Corporate Citi generally classifies wholesale loans and debt securities classified HTM or AFS as PCD when both of the following criteria are met: (i) the purchase price discount is at least 10% of par and (ii) the purchase date is more than 90 days after the origination or issuance date. Citi classifies HTM beneficial interests rated AA- and lower obtained at origination from certain securitization transactions as PCD when there is a significant difference (i.e., 10% or greater) between contractual cash flows, adjusted for prepayments, and expected cash flows at the date of recognition. Reserve Estimates and Policies Management provides reserves for an estimate of lifetime ECLs in the funded loan portfolio on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in the form of an ACL. These reserves are established in accordance with Citigroup’s credit reserve policies, as approved by the Audit Committee of the Citigroup Board of Directors. Citi’s Chief Risk Officer and Chief Financial Officer review the adequacy of the credit loss reserves each quarter with risk management and finance representatives for each applicable business area. Applicable business areas include those having classifiably managed portfolios, where internal credit risk ratings are assigned (primarily ICG) and delinquency managed portfolios (primarily GCB) or modified consumer loans, where concessions were granted due to the borrowers’ financial difficulties. The aforementioned representatives for these business areas present recommended reserve balances for their funded and unfunded lending portfolios along with supporting quantitative and qualitative data discussed below: Estimated credit losses for non-performing, non-homogeneous exposures within a business line’s classifiably managed portfolio and impaired smaller-balance homogeneous loans whose terms have been modified due to the borrowers’ financial difficulties, where it was determined that a concession was granted to the borrower. Consideration may be given to the following, as appropriate, when determining this estimate: (i) the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s original effective rate, (ii) the borrower’s overall financial condition, resources and payment record and (iii) the prospects for support from financially responsible guarantors or the realizable value of any collateral. In the determination of the 152 ACL for TDRs, management considers a combination of historical re-default rates, the current economic environment and the nature of the modification program when forecasting expected cash flows. When impairment is measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows, the entire change in present value is recorded in Provisions for credit losses . Estimated credit losses in the delinquency-managed portfolios for performing exposures. In addition, risk management and finance representatives who cover business areas with delinquency-managed portfolios containing smaller-balance homogeneous loans present their recommended reserve balances based on leading credit indicators, including loan delinquencies and changes in portfolio size as well as economic trends, including current and future housing prices, unemployment, length of time in foreclosure, costs to sell and GDP. This methodology is applied separately for each product within each geographic region in which these portfolios exist. This evaluation process is subject to numerous estimates and judgments. The frequency of default, risk ratings, loss recovery rates, size and diversity of individual large credits and ability of borrowers with foreign currency obligations to obtain the foreign currency necessary for orderly debt servicing, among other things, are all taken into account during this review. Changes in these estimates could have a direct impact on the credit costs in any period and could result in a change in the allowance. Allowance for Unfunded Lending Commitments Credit loss reserves are recognized on all off-balance sheet commitments that are not unconditionally cancelable. Corporate loan EAD models include an incremental usage factor (or credit conversion factor) to estimate ECLs on amounts undrawn at the reporting date. Off-balance sheet commitments include unfunded exposures, revolving facilities, securities underwriting commitments, letters of credit, HELOCs and financial guarantees, which excludes performance guarantees. This reserve is classified on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in Other liabilities . Changes to the allowance for unfunded lending commitments are recorded in Provision for credit losses on unfunded lending commitments . Mortgage Servicing Rights (MSRs) Mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) are recognized as intangible assets when purchased or when the Company sells or securitizes loans acquired through purchase or origination and retains the right to service the loans. Mortgage servicing rights are accounted for at fair value, with changes in value recorded in Other revenue in the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Income. For additional information on the Company’s MSRs, see Notes 16 and 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is subject to annual impairment testing and interim assessments between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Under ASC Topic 350, Intangibles—Goodwill and Other and upon the adoption of ASU No. 2017-04 on January 1, 2020, the Company has an option to assess qualitative factors to determine if it is necessary to perform the goodwill impairment test. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, the Company determines that it is not more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, no further testing is necessary. If, however, the Company determines that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the Company must perform the quantitative test. The Company has an unconditional option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any reporting period and proceed directly to the quantitative test. The quantitative test requires a comparison of the fair value of the individual reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is in excess of the carrying value, the related goodwill is considered not impaired and no further analysis is necessary. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Upon any business disposition, goodwill is allocated to, and derecognized with, the disposed business based on the ratio of the fair value of the disposed business to the fair value of the reporting unit. Additional information on Citi’s goodwill impairment testing can be found in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Intangible Assets Intangible assets— including core deposit intangibles, present value of future profits, purchased credit card relationships, credit card contract related intangibles, other customer relationships and other intangible assets, but excluding MSRs—are amortized over their estimated useful lives. Intangible assets that are deemed to have indefinite useful lives, primarily trade names, are not amortized and are subject to annual impairment tests. An impairment exists if the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value. For other intangible assets subject to amortization, an impairment is recognized if the carrying amount is not recoverable and exceeds the fair value of the intangible asset. Other Assets and Other Liabilities Other assets include, among other items, loans HFS, deferred tax assets, equity method investments, interest and fees receivable, lease right-of-use assets, premises and equipment (including purchased and developed software), repossessed assets and other receivables. Other liabilities include, among other items, accrued expenses and other payables, lease liabilities, deferred tax liabilities and reserves for legal claims, taxes, unfunded lending commitments, repositioning reserves and other payables. 153 Other Real Estate Owned and Repossessed Assets Real estate or other assets received through foreclosure or repossession are generally reported in Other assets , net of a valuation allowance for selling costs and subsequent declines in fair value. Securitizations There are two key accounting determinations that must be made relating to securitizations. Citi first makes a determination as to whether the securitization entity must be consolidated. Second, it determines whether the transfer of financial assets to the entity is considered a sale under GAAP. If the securitization entity is a VIE, the Company consolidates the VIE if it is the primary beneficiary (as discussed in “Variable Interest Entities” above). For all other securitization entities determined not to be VIEs in which Citigroup participates, consolidation is based on which party has voting control of the entity, giving consideration to removal and liquidation rights in certain partnership structures. Only securitization entities controlled by Citigroup are consolidated. Interests in the securitized and sold assets may be retained in the form of subordinated or senior interest-only strips, subordinated tranches, spread accounts and servicing rights. In credit card securitizations, the Company retains a seller’s interest in the credit card receivables transferred to the trusts, which is not in securitized form. In the case of consolidated securitization entities, including the credit card trusts, these retained interests are not reported on Citi’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. The securitized loans remain on the balance sheet. Substantially all of the consumer loans sold or securitized through non-consolidated trusts by Citigroup are U.S. prime residential mortgage loans. Retained interests in non-consolidated mortgage securitization trusts are classified as Trading account assets , except for MSRs, which are included in Intangible assets on Citigroup’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. Debt Short-term borrowings and Long-term debt are accounted for at amortized cost, except where the Company has elected to report the debt instruments, including certain structured notes, at fair value, or the debt is in a fair value hedging relationship. Transfers of Financial Assets For a transfer of financial assets to be considered a sale: (i) the assets must be legally isolated from the Company, even in bankruptcy or other receivership, (ii) the purchaser must have the right to pledge or sell the assets transferred (or, if the purchaser is an entity whose sole purpose is to engage in securitization and asset-backed financing activities through the issuance of beneficial interests and that entity is constrained from pledging the assets it receives, each beneficial interest holder must have the right to sell or pledge their beneficial interests) and (iii) the Company may not have an option or obligation to reacquire the assets. If these sale requirements are met, the assets are removed from the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. If the conditions for sale are not met, the transfer is considered to be a secured borrowing, the assets remain on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the sale proceeds are recognized as the Company’s liability. A legal opinion on a sale generally is obtained for complex transactions or where the Company has continuing involvement with assets transferred or with the securitization entity. For a transfer to be eligible for sale accounting, that opinion must state that the asset transfer would be considered a sale and that the assets transferred would not be consolidated with the Company’s other assets in the event of the Company’s insolvency. For a transfer of a portion of a financial asset to be considered a sale, the portion transferred must meet the definition of a participating interest. A participating interest must represent a pro rata ownership in an entire financial asset; all cash flows must be divided proportionately, with the same priority of payment; no participating interest in the transferred asset may be subordinated to the interest of another participating interest holder; and no party may have the right to pledge or exchange the entire financial asset unless all participating interest holders agree. Otherwise, the transfer is accounted for as a secured borrowing. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Risk Management Activities—Derivatives Used for Hedging Purposes The Company manages its exposures to market movements outside of its trading activities by modifying the asset and liability mix, either directly or through the use of derivative financial products, including interest rate swaps, futures, forwards and purchased options, as well as foreign-exchange contracts. These end-user derivatives are carried at fair value in Trading account assets and Trading account liabilities . See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of the Company’s hedging and derivative activities. Instrument-specific Credit Risk Citi presents separately in AOCI the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk, when the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments. Accordingly, the change in fair value of liabilities for which the fair value option was elected, related to changes in Citigroup’s own credit spreads, is presented in AOCI . Employee Benefits Expense Employee benefits expense includes current service costs of pension and other postretirement benefit plans (which are accrued on a current basis), contributions and unrestricted awards under other employee plans, the amortization of restricted stock awards and costs of other employee benefits. For its most significant pension and postretirement benefit plans (Significant Plans), Citigroup measures and discloses plan obligations, plan assets and periodic plan expense quarterly, instead of annually. The effect of remeasuring the Significant Plan obligations and assets by updating plan actuarial assumptions on a quarterly basis is reflected in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and periodic plan expense. All other plans (All Other Plans) are remeasured annually. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 154 Stock-Based Compensation The Company recognizes compensation expense related to stock and option awards over the requisite service period, generally based on the instruments’ grant-date fair value, reduced by actual forfeitures as they occur. Compensation cost related to awards granted to employees who meet certain age plus years-of-service requirements (retirement-eligible employees) is accrued in the year prior to the grant date, in the same manner as the accrual for cash incentive compensation. Certain stock awards with performance conditions or certain clawback provisions are subject to variable accounting, pursuant to which the associated compensation expense fluctuates with changes in Citigroup’s common stock price. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Income Taxes The Company is subject to the income tax laws of the U.S. and its states and municipalities, as well as the non-U.S. jurisdictions in which it operates. These tax laws are complex and may be subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities. In establishing a provision for income tax expense, the Company must make judgments and interpretations about these tax laws. The Company must also make estimates about when in the future certain items will affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions, both domestic and foreign. Disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be subject to review and adjudication by the court systems of the various tax jurisdictions, or may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or audit. The Company treats interest and penalties on income taxes as a component of Income tax expense . Deferred taxes are recorded for the future consequences of events that have been recognized in financial statements or tax returns, based upon enacted tax laws and rates. Deferred tax assets are recognized subject to management’s judgment about whether realization is more-likely-than-not. ASC 740, Income Taxes , sets out a consistent framework to determine the appropriate level of tax reserves to maintain for uncertain tax positions. This interpretation uses a two-step approach wherein a tax benefit is recognized if a position is more-likely-than-not to be sustained. The amount of the benefit is then measured to be the highest tax benefit that is more than 50% likely to be realized. ASC 740 also sets out disclosure requirements to enhance transparency of an entity’s tax reserves. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further description of the Company’s tax provision and related income tax assets and liabilities. Commissions, Underwriting and Principal Transactions Commissions and fees revenues are recognized in income when earned. Underwriting revenues are recognized in income typically at the closing of the transaction. Principal transactions revenues are recognized in income on a trade-date basis. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the Company’s revenue recognition policies for Commissions and fees , and Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details of Principal transactions revenue. Earnings per Share Earnings per share (EPS) is computed after deducting preferred stock dividends. The Company has granted restricted and deferred share awards with dividend rights that are considered to be participating securities, which are akin to a second class of common stock. Accordingly, a portion of Citigroup’s earnings is allocated to those participating securities in the EPS calculation. Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders after the allocation of dividends and undistributed earnings to the participating securities by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised. It is computed after giving consideration to the weighted average dilutive effect of the Company’s stock options and warrants and convertible securities and after the allocation of earnings to the participating securities. Anti-dilutive options and warrants are disregarded in the EPS calculations. Use of Estimates Management must make estimates and assumptions that affect the Consolidated Financial Statements and the related Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Such estimates are used in connection with certain fair value measurements. See Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussions on estimates used in the determination of fair value. Moreover, estimates are significant in determining the amounts of other-than-temporary impairments, impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets, provisions for probable losses that may arise from credit-related exposures and probable and estimable losses related to litigation and regulatory proceedings, and income taxes. While management makes its best judgment, actual amounts or results could differ from those estimates. Cash Flows Cash equivalents are defined as those amounts included in Cash and due from banks and predominately all of Deposits with banks . Cash flows from risk management activities are classified in the same category as the related assets and liabilities. Related Party Transactions The Company has related party transactions with certain of its subsidiaries and affiliates. These transactions, which are primarily short-term in nature, include cash accounts, collateralized financing transactions, margin accounts, derivative transactions, charges for operational support and the borrowing and lending of funds, and are entered into in the ordinary course of business. 155 ACCOUNTING CHANGES Accounting for Financial Instruments — Credit Losses Overview In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments — Credit Losses (Topic 326). The ASU introduced a new credit loss methodology, the current expected credit losses (CECL) methodology, which requires earlier recognition of credit losses while also providing additional disclosure about credit risk. Citi adopted the ASU as of January 1, 2020, which, as discussed below, resulted in an increase in Citi’s Allowance for credit losses and a decrease to opening Retained earnings , net of deferred income taxes, at January 1, 2020. The CECL methodology utilizes a lifetime “expected credit loss” measurement objective for the recognition of credit losses for loans, held-to-maturity debt securities, receivables and other financial assets measured at amortized cost at the time the financial asset is originated or acquired. The ACL is adjusted each period for changes in expected lifetime credit losses. The CECL methodology represents a significant change from prior U.S. GAAP and replaced the prior multiple existing impairment methods, which generally required that a loss be incurred before it was recognized. Within the life cycle of a loan or other financial asset, the methodology generally results in the earlier recognition of the provision for credit losses and the related ACL than prior U.S. GAAP. For available-for-sale debt securities where fair value is less than cost that Citi intends to hold or more-likely-than-not will not be required to sell, credit-related impairment, if any, is recognized through an ACL and adjusted each period for changes in credit risk. January 1, 2020 CECL Transition (Day 1) Impact The CECL methodology’s impact on expected credit losses, among other things, reflects Citi’s view of the current state of the economy, forecasted macroeconomic conditions and Citi’s portfolios. At the January 1, 2020 date of adoption, based on forecasts of macroeconomic conditions and exposures at that time, the aggregate impact to Citi was an approximate $ 4.1 billion, or an approximate 29 %, pretax increase in the Allowance for credit losses , along with a $ 3.1 billion after-tax decrease in Retained earnings and a deferred tax asset increase of $ 1.0 billion. This transition impact reflects (i) a $ 4.9 billion build to the Allowance for credit losses for Citi’s consumer exposures, primarily driven by the impact on credit card receivables of longer estimated tenors under the CECL lifetime expected credit loss methodology (loss coverage of approximately 23 months) compared to shorter estimated tenors under the probable loss methodology under prior U.S. GAAP (loss coverage of approximately 14 months), net of recoveries; and (ii) a release of $ 0.8 billion of reserves primarily related to Citi’s corporate net loan loss exposures, largely due to more precise contractual maturities that result in shorter remaining tenors, incorporation of recoveries and use of more specific historical loss data based on an increase in portfolio segmentation across industries and geographies. Under the CECL methodology, the Allowance for credit losses consists of quantitative and qualitative components. Citi’s quantitative component of the Allowance for credit losses is model based and utilizes a single forward-looking macroeconomic forecast, complemented by the qualitative component described below, in estimating expected credit losses and discounts inputs for the corporate classifiably managed portfolios. Reasonable and supportable forecast periods vary by product. For example, Citi’s consumer models use a 13-quarter reasonable and supportable period and revert to historical loss experience thereafter, while its corporate loan models use a nine-quarter reasonable and supportable period followed by a three-quarter graduated transition to historical loss experience. Citi’s qualitative component of the Allowance for credit losses considers (i) the uncertainty of forward-looking scenarios based on the likelihood and severity of a possible recession as another possible scenario; (ii) certain portfolio characteristics, such as portfolio concentration and collateral coverage; and (iii) model limitations as well as idiosyncratic events. Citi calculates a judgmental management adjustment, which is an alternative, more adverse scenario that only considers downside risk. Accounting for Variable Post-Charge-Off Third-Party Collection Costs During the second quarter of 2020 Citi changed its accounting for variable post-charge-off third-party collection costs, whereby these costs were accounted for as an increase in expenses as incurred rather than a reduction in expected credit recoveries. Citi concluded that such a change in the method of accounting is preferable in Citi’s circumstances as it better reflects the nature of these collection costs. That is, these costs do not represent reduced payments from borrowers and are similar to Citi’s other executory third-party vendor contracts that are accounted for as operating expenses as incurred. As a result of this change, Citi had a consumer ACL release of $ 426 million in the second quarter of 2020 for its U.S. cards portfolios and $ 122 million in the third quarter of 2020 for its international portfolios. In the fourth quarter of 2020, Citi revised the second quarter of 2020 accounting conclusion from a “change in accounting estimate effected by a change in accounting principle” to a “change in accounting principle,” which requires an adjustment to opening retained earnings rather than net income, with retrospective application to the earliest period presented. Citi considered the guidance in ASC Topic 250, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections ; ASC Topic 270, Interim Reporting ; ASC Topic 250-S99-1, Assessing Materiality ; and ASC Topic 250-S99-23, Accounting Changes Not Retroactively Applied Due to Immateriality, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements . Citi believes that the effects of the revisions were not material to any previously reported quarterly or annual period. As a result, Citi’s full-year and quarterly results have been revised to reflect this change as if it were effective as of January 1, 2020 (impacts to 2018 and 2019 were de minimis). Accordingly, Citi recorded an increase to its beginning retained earnings on January 1, 2020 of $ 330 million and a decrease of $ 443 million to its ACL. Further, Citi recorded a decrease of $ 18 million to its provisions for credit losses on loans in the 156 first quarter of 2020 and an increase of $ 339 million and $ 122 million to its provisions for credit losses on loans in the second and third quarters of 2020, respectively. In addition, Citi`s operating expenses increased by $ 49 million and $ 45 million, with a corresponding decrease in net credit losses, in the first and second quarters of 2020, respectively. As a result of these changes, Citi’s net income for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $ 330 million lower, or $ 0.16 per share lower, than under the previous presentation as a change in accounting estimate. Reference Rate Reform In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting, which provides optional guidance to ease the potential burden in accounting for (or recognizing the effects of) reference rate reform on financial reporting. Specifically, the guidance permits an entity, when certain criteria are met, to consider amendments to contracts made to comply with reference rate reform to meet the definition of a modification under U.S. GAAP. It further allows hedge accounting to be maintained and permits a one-time transfer or sale of qualifying held-to-maturity securities. The expedients and exceptions provided by the amendments are permitted to be adopted any time through December 31, 2022 and do not apply to contract modifications made and hedging relationships entered into or evaluated after December 31, 2022, except for certain optional expedients elected for certain hedging relationships existing as of December 31, 2022. The ASU was adopted by Citi as of June 30, 2020 with prospective application and did not impact financial results in 2020. In January 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-01, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Scope , which clarifies that the scope of the initial accounting relief issued by the FASB in March 2020 includes derivative instruments that do not reference a rate that is expected to be discontinued but that use an interest rate for margining, discounting, or contract price alignment that is modified as a result of reference rate reform (commonly referred to as the "discounting transition"). The amendments do not apply to contract modifications made after December 31, 2022, new hedging relationships entered into after December 31, 2022, and existing hedging relationships evaluated for effectiveness in periods after December 31, 2022, except for hedging relationships existing as of December 31, 2022, that apply certain optional expedients in which the accounting effects are recorded through the end of the hedging relationship. The ASU was adopted by Citi on a full retrospective basis upon issuance and did not impact financial results in 2020. Lease Accounting In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) , which increases the transparency and comparability of accounting for lease transactions. The ASU requires lessees to recognize liabilities for operating leases and corresponding right-of-use (ROU) assets on the balance sheet. The ASU also requires quantitative and qualitative disclosures regarding key information about leasing arrangements. Lessee accounting for finance leases, as well as lessor accounting, is largely unchanged. Effective January 1, 2019, Citi prospectively adopted the provisions of the ASU. At adoption, Citi recognized a lease liability and a corresponding ROU asset of approximately $ 4.4 billion on the Consolidated Balance Sheet related to its future lease payments as a lessee under operating leases. In addition, Citi recorded a $ 151 million increase in Retained earnings for the cumulative effect of recognizing previously deferred gains on sale/leaseback transactions. Adoption of the ASU did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Statement of Income. See Notes 14 and 26 for additional details. Citi has elected not to separate lease and non-lease components in its lease contracts and accounts for them as a single lease component. Citi has also elected not to record an ROU asset for short-term leases that have a term of 12 months or less and do not contain purchase options that Citi is reasonably certain to exercise. The cost of short-term leases is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income on a straight-line basis over the lease term. In addition, Citi applies the portfolio approach to account for certain equipment leases with nearly identical contractual terms. Lessee accounting Operating lease ROU assets and lease liabilities are included in Other assets and Other liabilities , respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Finance lease assets and liabilities are included in Other assets and Long-term debt , respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Citi uses its incremental borrowing rate, factoring in the lease term, to determine the lease liability, which is measured at the present value of future lease payments. The ROU asset is initially measured at the amount of the lease liability plus any prepaid rent and remaining initial direct costs, less any remaining lease incentives and accrued rent. The ROU asset is subject to impairment, during the lease term, in a manner consistent with the impairment of long-lived assets. The lease terms include periods covered by options to extend or terminate the lease depending on whether Citi is reasonably certain to exercise such options. Lessor accounting Lessor accounting is largely unchanged under the ASU. Citi acts as a lessor for power, railcar, shipping and aircraft assets, where Citi has executed operating, direct financing and leveraged leasing arrangements. In a direct financing or a leveraged lease, Citi derecognizes the leased asset and records a lease financing receivable at lease commencement in Loans . Upon lease termination, Citi may obtain control of the asset, which is then recorded in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and any remaining receivable for the asset’s residual value is derecognized. Under the ASU, leveraged lease accounting is grandfathered and may continue to be applied until the leveraged lease is terminated or modified. Upon modification, the lease must be classified as an operating, direct finance or sales-type lease in accordance with the ASU. 157 Separately, as part of managing its real estate footprint, Citi subleases excess real estate space via operating lease arrangements. SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 On December 22, 2017, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 118, which set forth the accounting for the changes in tax law caused by the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Reform). SAB 118 provided guidance where the accounting under ASC 740 was incomplete for certain income tax effects of Tax Reform, at the time of the issuance of an entity’s financial statements for the period in which Tax Reform was enacted (provisional items). Citi disclosed several provisional items recorded as part of its $ 22.6 billion fourth quarter 2017 charge related to Tax Reform. Citi completed its accounting for Tax Reform under SAB 118 during the fourth quarter of 2018 and recorded a one-time, non-cash tax benefit of $ 94 million in Corporate/Other related to amounts that were considered provisional pursuant to SAB 118. The adjustments for the provisional amounts consisted of a $ 1.2 billion benefit relating to a reduction of the valuation allowance against Citi’s FTC carry-forwards and its U.S. residual DTAs related to its non-U.S. branches, offset by additional charges of $ 0.2 billion related to the impact of a change to a “quasi-territorial tax system” and $ 0.9 billion related to the impact of deemed repatriation of undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries. Also, Citi has made a policy election to account for taxes on Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (GILTI) as incurred. Revenue Recognition In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Revenue Recognition), which outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers. The core principle of the revenue model is that an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled, in exchange for those goods or services. The ASU defines the promised good or service as the performance obligation under the contract. While the guidance replaces most existing revenue recognition guidance in GAAP, the ASU is not applicable to financial instruments and, therefore, does not impact a majority of Citi’s revenues, including net interest income, loan fees, gains on sales and mark-to-market accounting. In accordance with the new revenue recognition standard, Citi has identified the specific performance obligation (promised services) associated with the contract with the customer and has determined when that specific performance obligation has been satisfied, which may be at a point in time or over time depending on how the performance obligation is defined. The contracts with customers also contain the transaction price, which consists of fixed consideration and/or consideration that may vary (variable consideration), and is defined as the amount of consideration an entity expects to be entitled to when or as the performance obligation is satisfied, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties (including transaction taxes). The amounts recognized at the point in time the performance obligation is satisfied may differ from the ultimate transaction price associated with that performance obligation when a portion of it is based on variable consideration. For example, some consideration is based on the client’s month-end balance or market values, which are unknown at the time the contract is executed. The remaining transaction price amount, if any, will be recognized as the variable consideration becomes determinable. In certain transactions, the performance obligation is considered satisfied at a point in time in the future. In this instance, Citi defers revenue on the balance sheet that will only be recognized upon completion of the performance obligation. The new revenue recognition standard further clarified the guidance related to reporting revenue gross as principal versus net as an agent. In many cases, Citi outsources a component of its performance obligations to third parties. Citi has determined that it acts as principal in the majority of these transactions and therefore presents the amounts paid to these third parties gross within operating expenses. The Company has retrospectively adopted this standard as of January 1, 2018 and as a result was required to report amounts paid to third parties where Citi is principal to the contract within Operating expenses. The adoption resulted in an increase in both revenue and expenses of approximately $ 1 billion for each of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2018 with similar amounts for prior years. Prior to adoption, these expense amounts were reported as contra revenue primarily within Commissions and fees and Administration and other fiduciary fees revenues. Accordingly, prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the new presentation. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the Company’s revenue recognition policies for Commissions and fees and Administration and other fiduciary fees . Income Tax Impact of Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16, Income Taxes—Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory , which requires an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs. The ASU was effective January 1, 2018 and was adopted as of that date. The impact of this standard was an increase of DTAs by approximately $ 300 million, a decrease of Retained earnings by approximately $ 80 million and a decrease of prepaid tax assets by approximately $ 380 million. Clarifying the Definition of a Business In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business. The definition of a business directly and indirectly affects many areas of accounting (e.g., acquisitions, disposals, goodwill and consolidation). The ASU narrows the definition of a business by introducing a quantitative screen as the first step, such that if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets, then the set of transferred assets and activities is not a business. If the set is not clarified from the quantitative screen, the entity 158 then evaluates whether the set meets the requirement that a business include, at a minimum, an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs. Citi adopted the ASU upon its effective date on January 1, 2018, prospectively. The ongoing impact of the ASU will depend upon the acquisition and disposal activities of Citi. If fewer transactions qualify as a business, there could be less initial recognition of Goodwill , but also less goodwill allocated to disposals. There was no impact during 2018 from the adoption of this ASU. Changes in Accounting for Pension and Postretirement (Benefit) Expense In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-07, Compensation—Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost , which changes the income statement presentation of net benefit expense and requires restating the Company’s financial statements for each of the earlier periods presented in Citi’s annual and interim financial statements. The change in presentation was effective for annual and interim periods starting January 1, 2018. The ASU requires that only the service cost component of net benefit expense be included in Compensation and benefits on the income statement. The other components of net benefit expense are required to be presented outside of Compensation and benefits and are presented in Other operating expenses . Since both of these income statement line items are part of Operating expenses , total Operating expenses and Net income will not change. This change in presentation did not have a material effect on Compensation and benefits and Other operating expenses and was applied prospectively. The components of the net benefit expense are disclosed in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The standard also changes the components of net benefit expense that are eligible for capitalization when employee costs are capitalized in connection with various activities, such as internally developed software, construction-in-progress and loan origination costs. Prospectively from January 1, 2018, only the service cost component of net benefit expense may be capitalized. Existing capitalized balances are not affected. This change in amounts eligible for capitalization does not have a material effect on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures. Hedging In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-12, Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities , which better aligns an entity’s risk management activities and financial reporting for hedging relationships through changes to the designation and measurement guidance for qualifying hedging relationships and the presentation of hedge results. The ASU requires the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument to be presented in the same income statement line as the hedged item and also requires expanded disclosures. Citi adopted this standard on January 1, 2018 and transferred approximately $ 4 billion of prepayable mortgage-backed securities and municipal bonds from held-to-maturity (HTM) into available-for-sale (AFS) securities classification as permitted as a one-time transfer upon adoption of the standard, as these assets were deemed to be eligible to be hedged under the last-of-layer hedge strategy. The impact to opening Retained earnings was immaterial. See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. FUTURE ACCOUNTING CHANGES Long-Duration Insurance Contracts In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-12, Financial Services—Insurance: Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts , which changes the existing recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosures for long-duration contracts issued by an insurance entity. Specifically, the guidance (i) improves the timeliness of recognizing changes in the liability for future policy benefits and prescribes the rate used to discount future cash flows for long-duration insurance contracts, (ii) simplifies and improves the accounting for certain market-based options or guarantees associated with deposit (or account balance) contracts, (iii) simplifies the amortization of deferred acquisition costs and (iv) introduces additional quantitative and qualitative disclosures. Citi has certain insurance subsidiaries, primarily in the U.S. and Mexico, that issue long-duration insurance contracts that will be impacted by the requirements of ASU 2018-12. The effective date of ASU No. 2018-12 was deferred for all insurance entities by ASU No. 2019-09, Finance Services—Insurance: Effective Date (issued in October 2019) and by ASU No. 2020-11, Financial Services—Insurance: Effective Date and Early Application (issued November 2020). Citi plans to adopt the targeted improvements in ASU 2018-12 on January 1, 2023 and is currently evaluating the impact of the standard on its insurance subsidiaries. Citi does not expect a material impact to its results of operations as a result of adopting the standard. SUPERSEDED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES Accounting for Credit Losses Prior to January 1, 2020, Citi applied the incurred loss method for the allowance for credit losses on loans and the other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI) method for HTM securities as follows. Allowance for Credit Losses The allowance for credit losses on loans represents management’s best estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the portfolio, including probable losses related to large individually evaluated impaired loans and troubled debt restructurings. Additions to the allowance are made through the Provision for credit losses on loans . Loan losses are deducted from the allowance and subsequent recoveries are added. Assets received in exchange for loan claims in a restructuring are initially recorded at fair value, with any gain or loss reflected as a recovery or charge-off in the provision. 159 Evaluating HTM Debt Securities for Other-Than-Temporary Impairment (OTTI) The Company conducts periodic reviews of all HTM debt securities with unrealized losses to evaluate whether the impairment is other-than-temporary. An unrealized loss exists when the current fair value of an individual debt security is lower than its adjusted amortized cost basis. Temporary losses related to HTM debt securities generally are not recorded, as these investments are carried at adjusted amortized cost basis. However, for HTM debt securities with credit-related impairment, the credit loss is recognized in earnings as OTTI, and any difference between the cost basis adjusted for the OTTI and fair value is recognized in AOCI and amortized as an adjustment of yield over the remaining contractual life of the security. 160 2. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND SIGNIFICANT DISPOSALS Summary of Discontinued Operations The Company’s results from Discontinued operations consisted of residual activities related to the sales of the Egg Banking plc credit card business in 2011 and the German retail banking business in 2008. All Discontinued operations results are recorded within Corporate/Other. The following table summarizes financial information for all Discontinued operations : In millions of dollars 2020 2019 2018 Total revenues, net of interest expense $ — $ — $ — Loss from discontinued operations $ ( 20 ) $ ( 31 ) $ ( 26 ) Benefit for income taxes — ( 27 ) ( 18 ) Loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes $ ( 20 ) $ ( 4 ) $ ( 8 ) Cash flows from Discontinued operations were not material for all periods presented. Significant Disposals There were no significant disposals during 2020 and 2019. The transaction described below was identified as a significant disposal in 2018. Sale of Mexico Asset Management Business On September 21, 2018, Citi completed the sale of its Mexico asset management business, which was part of Latin America GCB . As part of the sale, Citi derecognized total assets of $ 137 million and total liabilities of $ 41 million. The transaction resulted in a pretax gain on sale of approximately $ 250 million (approximately $ 150 million after-tax) recorded in Other revenue in 2018. Further, Citi and the buyer entered into a 10 -year services framework agreement, with Citi acting as the distributor in exchange for an ongoing fee. Income before taxes for the divested business, excluding the pretax gain on sale, was as follows: In millions of dollars 2020 2019 2018 Income before taxes $ — $ — $ 123 161 3. BUSINESS SEGMENTS Citigroup’s activities are conducted through the following business segments: Global Consumer Banking (GCB) and Institutional Clients Group (ICG) . In addition, Corporate/Other includes activities not assigned to a specific business segment, as well as certain North America legacy loan portfolios, discontinued operations and other legacy assets. The business segments are determined based on products and services provided or type of customers served, of which those identified as non-core are recorded in Corporate/Other and are reflective of how management allocates resources and measures financial performance to make business decisions. GCB includes a global, full-service consumer franchise delivering a wide array of banking, credit card, lending and investment services through a network of local branches, offices and electronic delivery systems and consists of three GCB businesses: North America , Latin America and Asia (including consumer banking activities in certain EMEA countries). ICG consists of Banking and Markets and securities services and provides corporate, institutional, public sector and high-net-worth clients in 96 countries and jurisdictions with a broad range of banking and financial products and services. Corporate/Other includes certain unallocated costs of global functions, other corporate expenses and net treasury results, offsets to certain line-item reclassifications and eliminations, the results of certain North America legacy loan portfolios, discontinued operations and unallocated taxes. The accounting policies of these reportable segments are the same as those disclosed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

COMMISSIONS AND FEES; ADMINISTRATION AND OTHER FIDUCIARY FEES Commissions and Fees The primary components of Commissions and fees revenue are investment banking fees, brokerage commissions, credit card and bank card income and deposit-related fees. Investment banking fees are substantially composed of underwriting and advisory revenues. Such fees are recognized at the point in time when Citigroup’s performance under the terms of a contractual arrangement is completed, which is typically at the closing of a transaction. Reimbursed expenses related to these transactions are recorded as revenue and are included within investment banking fees. In certain instances for advisory contracts, Citi will receive amounts in advance of the deal’s closing. In these instances, the amounts received will be recognized as a liability and not recognized in revenue until the transaction closes. For the periods presented, the contract liability amount was negligible. Out-of-pocket expenses associated with underwriting activity are deferred and recognized at the time the related revenue is recognized, while out-of-pocket expenses associated with advisory arrangements are expensed as incurred. In general, expenses incurred related to investment banking transactions, whether consummated or not, are recorded in Other operating expenses . The Company has determined that it acts as principal in the majority of these transactions and therefore presents expenses gross within Other operating expenses . Brokerage commissions primarily include commissions and fees from the following: executing transactions for clients on exchanges and over-the-counter markets; sales of mutual funds and other annuity products; and assisting clients in clearing transactions, providing brokerage services and other such activities. Brokerage commissions are recognized in Commissions and fees at the point in time the associated service is fulfilled, generally on the trade execution date. Gains or losses, if any, on these transactions are included in Principal transactions (see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Sales of certain investment products include a portion of variable consideration associated with the underlying product. In these instances, a portion of the revenue associated with the sale of the product is not recognized until the variable consideration becomes fixed. The Company recognized $ 495 million, $ 485 million and $ 521 million of revenue related to such variable consideration for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. These amounts primarily relate to performance obligations satisfied in prior periods. Credit card and bank card income is primarily composed of interchange fees, which are earned by card issuers based on purchase sales, and certain card fees, including annual fees. Costs related to customer reward programs and certain payments to partners (primarily based on program sales, profitability and customer acquisitions) are recorded as a reduction of credit card and bank card income. Citi’s credit card programs have certain partner sharing agreements that vary by partner. These partner sharing agreements are subject to contractually based performance thresholds that if met, would require Citi to make ongoing payments to the partner. The threshold is based on the profitability of a program and is generally calculated based on predefined program revenues less predefined program expenses. In most of Citi’s partner sharing agreements, program expenses include net credit losses and, to the extent that the increase in net credit losses reduces Citi’s liability for the partners’ share for a given program year, it would generally result in lower payments to partners in total for that year and vice versa. Further, in some instances, other partner payments are based on program sales and new account acquisitions.Interchange revenues are recognized as earned on a daily basis when Citi’s performance obligation to transmit funds to the payment networks has been satisfied. Annual card fees, net of origination costs, are deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis over a 12-month period. Costs related to card reward programs are recognized when the rewards are earned by the cardholders. Payments to partners are recognized when incurred. Deposit-related fees consist of service charges on deposit accounts and fees earned from performing cash management activities and other deposit account services. Such fees are recognized in the period in which the related service is provided. Transactional service fees primarily consist of fees charged for processing services such as cash management, global payments, clearing, international funds transfer and other trade services. Such fees are recognized as/when the associated service is satisfied, which normally occurs at the point in time the service is requested by the customer and provided by Citi. Insurance distribution revenue consists of commissions earned from third-party insurance companies for marketing and selling insurance policies on behalf of such entities. Such commissions are recognized in Commissions and fees at the point in time the associated service is fulfilled, generally when the insurance policy is sold to the policyholder. Sales of certain insurance products include a portion of variable consideration associated with the underlying product. In these instances, a portion of the revenue associated with the sale of the policy is not recognized until the variable consideration becomes determinable. The Company recognized $ 290 million, $ 322 million and $ 386 million of revenue related to such variable consideration for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. These amounts primarily relate to performance obligations satisfied in prior periods. Insurance premiums consist of premium income from insurance policies that Citi has underwritten and sold to policyholders. 164 The following table presents Commissions and fees revenue: 2020 2019 2018 In millions of dollars ICG GCB Corp/Other Total ICG GCB Corp/Other Total ICG GCB Corp/Other Total Investment banking $ 4,483 $ — $ — $ 4,483 $ 3,767 $ — $ — $ 3,767 $ 3,568 $ — $ — $ 3,568 Brokerage commissions 1,986 974 — 2,960 1,771 841 — 2,612 1,977 815 — 2,792 Credit card and bank card income Interchange fees 703 7,301 — 8,004 1,222 8,621 — 9,843 1,077 8,112 11 9,200 Card-related loan fees 23 626 — 649 60 718 — 778 63 627 12 702 Card rewards and partner payments ( 380 ) ( 8,293 ) — ( 8,673 ) ( 691 ) ( 8,883 ) — ( 9,574 ) ( 504 ) ( 8,253 ) ( 12 ) ( 8,769 ) Deposit-related fees (1) 958 376 — 1,334 1,048 470 — 1,518 1,031 572 1 1,604 Transactional service fees 886 88 — 974 824 123 — 947 733 83 4 820 Corporate finance (2) 457 — — 457 616 — — 616 734 — — 734 Insurance distribution revenue 11 492 — 503 12 524 — 536 14 565 11 590 Insurance premiums — 125 — 125 — 186 — 186 — 119 — 119 Loan servicing 82 30 25 137 78 55 21 154 100 91 37 228 Other 118 310 4 432 99 261 3 363 116 139 14 269 Total commissions and fees (3) $ 9,327 $ 2,029 $ 29 $ 11,385 $ 8,806 $ 2,916 $ 24 $ 11,746 $ 8,909 $ 2,870 $ 78 $ 11,857 (1) Includes overdraft fees of $ 100 million, $ 127 million and $ 128 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Overdraft fees are accounted for under ASC 310. (2) Consists primarily of fees earned from structuring and underwriting loan syndications or related financing activity. This activity is accounted for under ASC 310. (3) Commissions and fees includes $( 7,160 ) million, $( 7,695 ) million and $( 6,853 ) million not accounted for under ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Amounts reported in Commissions and fees accounted for under other guidance primarily include card-related loan fees, card reward programs and certain partner payments, corporate finance fees, insurance premiums and loan servicing fees. 165 Administration and Other Fiduciary Fees Administration and other fiduciary fees revenue is primarily composed of custody fees and fiduciary fees. The custody product is composed of numerous services related to the administration, safekeeping and reporting for both U.S. and non-U.S. denominated securities. The services offered to clients include trade settlement, safekeeping, income collection, corporate action notification, record-keeping and reporting, tax reporting and cash management. These services are provided for a wide range of securities, including but not limited to equities, municipal and corporate bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, money market instruments, U.S. Treasuries and agencies, derivative instruments, mutual funds, alternative investments and precious metals. Custody fees are recognized as or when the associated promised service is satisfied, which normally occurs at the point in time the service is requested by the customer and provided by Citi. Fiduciary fees consist of trust services and investment management services. As an escrow agent, Citi receives, safe-keeps, services and manages clients’ escrowed assets, such as cash, securities, property (including intellectual property), contracts or other collateral. Citi performs its escrow agent duties by safekeeping the funds during the specified time period agreed upon by all parties and therefore earns its revenue evenly during the contract duration. Investment management services consist of managing assets on behalf of Citi’s retail and institutional clients. Revenue from these services primarily consists of asset-based fees for advisory accounts, which are based on the market value of the client’s assets and recognized monthly, when the market value is fixed. In some instances, the Company contracts with third-party advisors and with third-party custodians. The Company has determined that it acts as principal in the majority of these transactions and therefore presents the amounts paid to third parties gross within Other operating expenses .

These amounts include guarantee fees. 166 6. PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS Principal transactions revenue consists of realized and unrealized gains and losses from trading activities. Trading activities include revenues from fixed income, equities, credit and commodities products and foreign exchange transactions that are managed on a portfolio basis and characterized below based on the primary risk managed by each trading desk. Not included in the table below is the impact of net interest revenue related to trading activities, which is an integral part of trading activities’ profitability. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information about net interest revenue related to trading activities. Principal transactions include CVA (credit valuation adjustments) and FVA (funding valuation adjustments) on over-the-counter derivatives, and gains (losses) on certain economic hedges on loans in ICG . These adjustments are discussed further in Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In certain transactions, Citi incurs fees and presents these fees paid to third parties in operating expenses. The following table presents Principal transactions revenue: In millions of dollars 2020 2019 2018 Interest rate risks (1) $ 5,561 $ 3,831 $ 2,889 Foreign exchange risks (2) 4,158 3,850 3,772 Equity risks (3) 1,343 808 1,221 Commodity and other risks (4) 1,133 546 668 Credit products and risks (5) 1,690 ( 143 ) 355 Total $ 13,885 $ 8,892 $ 8,905 (1)    Includes revenues from government securities and corporate debt, municipal securities, mortgage securities and other debt instruments.

INCENTIVE PLANS Discretionary Annual Incentive Awards Citigroup grants immediate cash bonus payments and various forms of immediate and deferred awards as part of its discretionary annual incentive award program involving a large segment of Citigroup’s employees worldwide. Most of the shares of common stock issued by Citigroup as part of its equity compensation programs are issued to settle the vesting of the stock components of these awards. Discretionary annual incentive awards are generally awarded in the first quarter of the year based on the previous year’s performance. Awards valued at less than U.S. $ 100,000 (or the local currency equivalent) are generally paid entirely in the form of an immediate cash bonus. Pursuant to Citigroup policy and/or regulatory requirements, certain employees are subject to mandatory deferrals of incentive pay and generally receive 25 %– 60 % of their awards in a combination of restricted or deferred stock, deferred cash stock units or deferred cash. Discretionary annual incentive awards to many employees in the EU are subject to deferral requirements regardless of the total award value, with at least 50 % of the immediate incentive delivered in the form of a stock payment award subject to a restriction on sale or transfer (generally, for 12 months). Deferred annual incentive awards may be delivered in the form of one or more award types: a restricted or deferred stock award under Citi’s Capital Accumulation Program (CAP), or a deferred cash stock unit award and/or a deferred cash award under Citi’s Deferred Cash Award Plan. The applicable mix of awards may vary based on the employee’s minimum deferral requirement and the country of employment. Subject to certain exceptions (principally, for retirement-eligible employees), continuous employment within Citigroup is required to vest in CAP, deferred cash stock unit and deferred cash awards. Post employment vesting by retirement-eligible employees and participants who meet other conditions is generally conditioned upon their refraining from competition with Citigroup during the remaining vesting period, unless the employment relationship has been terminated by Citigroup under certain conditions. Generally, the deferred awards vest in equal annual installments over three - or four-year periods. Vested CAP awards are delivered in shares of common stock. Deferred cash awards are payable in cash and, except as prohibited by applicable regulatory guidance, earn a fixed notional rate of interest that is paid only if and when the underlying principal award amount vests. Deferred cash stock unit awards are payable in cash at the vesting value of the underlying stock. Generally, in the EU, vested CAP shares are subject to a restriction on sale or transfer after vesting, and vested deferred cash awards and deferred cash stock units are subject to hold back (generally, for 6 or 12 months based on the award type). Unvested CAP, deferred cash stock units and deferred cash awards are subject to one or more clawback provisions that apply in certain circumstances, including gross misconduct. CAP and deferred cash stock unit awards, made to certain employees, are subject to a formulaic performance-based vesting condition pursuant to which amounts otherwise scheduled to vest will be reduced based on the amount of any pretax loss in the participant’s business in the calendar year preceding the scheduled vesting date. A minimum reduction of 20 % applies for the first dollar of loss for CAP and deferred cash stock unit awards. In addition, deferred cash awards are subject to a discretionary performance-based vesting condition under which an amount otherwise scheduled to vest may be reduced in the event of a “material adverse outcome” for which a participant has “significant responsibility.” These awards are also subject to an additional clawback provision pursuant to which unvested awards may be canceled if the employee engaged in misconduct or exercised materially imprudent judgment, or failed to supervise or escalate the behavior of other employees who did. Sign-on and Long-Term Retention Awards Stock awards and deferred cash awards may be made at various times during the year as sign-on awards to induce new hires to join Citi or to high-potential employees as long-term retention awards. Vesting periods and other terms and conditions pertaining to these awards tend to vary by grant. Generally, recipients must remain employed through the vesting dates to vest in the awards, except in cases of death, disability or involuntary termination other than for gross misconduct. These awards do not usually provide for post employment vesting by retirement-eligible participants. Outstanding (Unvested) Stock Awards A summary of the status of unvested stock awards granted as discretionary annual incentive or sign-on and long-term retention awards is presented below: Unvested stock awards Shares Weighted- average grant date fair value per share Unvested at December 31, 2019 30,194,715 $ 61.30 Granted (1) 12,361,412 76.68 Canceled ( 606,918 ) 69.22 Vested (2) ( 13,722,917 ) 58.45 Unvested at December 31, 2020 28,226,292 $ 69.25 (1) The weighted-average fair value of the shares granted during 2019 and 2018 was $ 61.78 and $ 73.87 , respectively. (2) The weighted-average fair value of the shares vesting during 2020 was approximately $ 79.68 per share. Total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock awards was $ 580 million at December 31, 2020. The cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.6 years. 168 Performance Share Units Certain executive officers were awarded a target number of performance share units (PSUs) every February from 2017 to 2020, for performance in the year prior to the award date. The PSUs granted each February from 2017 to 2020 were earned over the preceding three-year performance period, based half on return on tangible common equity performance in the last year of the three-year performance period and the remaining half on cumulative earnings per share over the three-year performance period. For all award years, if the total shareholder return is negative over the three-year performance period, executives may earn no more than 100 % of the target PSUs, regardless of the extent to which Citigroup outperforms peer firms. The number of PSUs ultimately earned could vary from zero , if performance goals are not met, to as much as 150 % of target, if performance goals are meaningfully exceeded. For all award years, the value of each PSU is equal to the value of one share of Citi common stock. Dividend equivalents will be accrued and paid on the number of earned PSUs after the end of the performance period. PSUs are subject to variable accounting, pursuant to which the associated value of the award will fluctuate with changes in Citigroup’s stock price and the attainment of the specified performance goals for each award, until the award is settled solely in cash after the end of the performance period. The value of the award, subject to the performance goals, is estimated using a simulation model that incorporates multiple valuation assumptions, including the probability of achieving the specified performance goals of each award. The risk-free rate used in the model is based on the applicable U.S. Treasury yield curve. Other significant assumptions for the awards are as follows: Valuation assumptions 2020 2019 2018 Expected volatility 22.26 % 25.33 % 24.93 % Expected dividend yield 2.82 2.67 1.75 A summary of the performance share unit activity for 2020 is presented below: Performance share units Units Weighted- average grant date fair value per unit Outstanding, beginning of year 1,492,000 $ 71.69 Granted (1) 440,349 78.06 Canceled — — Payments ( 598,546 ) 59.22 Outstanding, end of year 1,333,803 $ 79.39 (1) Grant activity for 2020 includes additional units earned on the 2017 grant. The weighted-average grant price for the 2020 grant alone was $ 83.45 . The weighted-average grant date fair value per unit awarded in 2019 and 2018 was $ 72.83 and $ 83.24 , respectively. PSUs granted in 2017 were equitably adjusted after the enactment of Tax Reform, as required under the terms of those awards. The adjustments were intended to reproduce the expected value of the awards immediately prior to the passage of Tax Reform. Stock Option Programs All outstanding stock options are fully vested, with the related expense recognized as a charge to income in prior periods. 169 The following table presents information with respect to stock option activity under Citigroup’s stock option programs: 2020 2019 2018 Options Weighted- average exercise price Intrinsic value per share Options Weighted- average exercise price Intrinsic value per share Options Weighted- average exercise price Intrinsic value per share Outstanding, beginning of year 166,650 $ 47.42 $ 32.47 762,225 $ 101.84 $ — 1,138,813 $ 161.96 $ — Canceled — — — ( 11,365 ) 40.80 — — — — Expired — — — ( 449,916 ) 142.30 — ( 376,588 ) 283.63 — Exercised — — — ( 134,294 ) 39.00 23.50 — — — Outstanding, end of year 166,650 $ 47.42 $ 14.24 166,650 $ 47.42 $ 32.47 762,225 $ 101.84 $ — Exercisable, end of year 166,650 166,650 762,225 The following table summarizes information about stock options outstanding under Citigroup’s stock option programs at December 31, 2020: Options outstanding Options exercisable Range of exercise prices Number outstanding Weighted-average contractual life remaining Weighted-average exercise price Number exercisable Weighted-average exercise price $ 41.54 –$ 60.00 166,650 0.4 years $ 47.42 166,650 $ 47.42 Total at December 31, 2020 166,650 0.4 years $ 47.42 166,650 $ 47.42 Other Variable Incentive Compensation Citigroup has various incentive plans globally that are used to motivate and reward performance primarily in the areas of sales, operational excellence and customer satisfaction. Participation in these plans is generally limited to employees who are not eligible for discretionary annual incentive awards. Other forms of variable compensation include monthly commissions paid to financial advisors and mortgage loan officers. Summary Except for awards subject to variable accounting, the total expense recognized for stock awards represents the grant date fair value of such awards, which is generally recognized as a charge to income ratably over the vesting period, other than for awards to retirement-eligible employees and immediately vested awards. Whenever awards are made or are expected to be made to retirement-eligible employees, the charge to income is accelerated based on when the applicable conditions to retirement eligibility were or will be met. If the employee is retirement eligible on the grant date, or the award is vested at the grant date, the entire expense is recognized in the year prior to grant. Recipients of Citigroup stock awards generally do not have any stockholder rights until shares are delivered upon vesting or exercise, or after the expiration of applicable required holding periods. Recipients of restricted or deferred stock awards and deferred cash stock unit awards, however, may, except as prohibited by applicable regulatory guidance, be entitled to receive or accrue dividends or dividend-equivalent payments during the vesting period. Recipients of restricted stock awards generally are entitled to vote the shares in their award during the vesting period. Once a stock award vests, the shares delivered to the participant are freely transferable, unless they are subject to a restriction on sale or transfer for a specified period. All equity awards granted since April 19, 2005 have been made pursuant to stockholder-approved stock incentive plans that are administered by the Personnel and Compensation Committee of the Citigroup Board of Directors, which is composed entirely of independent non-employee directors. At December 31, 2020, approximately 34.0 million shares of Citigroup common stock were authorized and available for grant under Citigroup’s 2019 Stock Incentive Plan, the only plan from which equity awards are currently granted. The 2019 Stock Incentive Plan and predecessor plans permit the use of treasury stock or newly issued shares in connection with awards granted under the plans. Treasury shares were used to settle vestings from 2017 to 2020, and for the first quarter of 2021, except where local laws favor newly issued shares. The use of treasury stock or newly issued shares to settle stock awards does not affect the compensation expense recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Income for equity awards. 170 Incentive Compensation Cost The following table shows components of compensation expense, relating to certain of the incentive compensation programs described above: In millions of dollars 2020 2019 2018 Charges for estimated awards to retirement-eligible colleagues $ 748 $ 683 $ 669 Amortization of deferred cash awards, deferred cash stock units and performance stock units 201 355 202 Immediately vested stock award expense (1) 95 82 75 Amortization of restricted and deferred stock awards (2) 420 404 435 Other variable incentive compensation 627 666 640 Total $ 2,091 $ 2,190 $ 2,021 (1)    Represents expense for immediately vested stock awards that generally were stock payments in lieu of cash compensation. The expense is generally accrued as cash incentive compensation in the year prior to grant. (2)    All periods include amortization expense for all unvested awards to non-retirement-eligible colleagues. 171 8. RETIREMENT BENEFITS Pension and Postretirement Plans The Company has several non-contributory defined benefit pension plans covering certain U.S. employees and has various defined benefit pension and termination indemnity plans covering employees outside the U.S. The U.S. qualified defined benefit plan was frozen effective January 1, 2008 for most employees. Accordingly, no additional compensation-based contributions have been credited to the cash balance portion of the plan for existing plan participants after 2007. However, certain employees covered under the prior final pay plan formula continue to accrue benefits. The Company also offers postretirement health care and life insurance benefits to certain eligible U.S. retired employees, as well as to certain eligible employees outside the U.S. The Company also sponsors a number of non-contributory, nonqualified pension plans. These plans, which are unfunded, provide supplemental defined pension benefits to certain U.S. employees. With the exception of certain employees covered under the prior final pay plan formula, the benefits under these plans were frozen in prior years. The plan obligations, plan assets and periodic plan expense for the Company’s most significant pension and postretirement benefit plans (Significant Plans) are measured and disclosed quarterly, instead of annually. The Significant Plans captured approximately 90 % of the Company’s global pension and postretirement plan obligations as of December 31, 2020. All other plans (All Other Plans) are measured annually with a December 31 measurement date. Net (Benefit) Expense The following table summarizes the components of net (benefit) expense recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income for the Company’s pension and postretirement plans for Significant Plans and All Other Plans: Pension plans Postretirement benefit plans U.S. plans Non-U.S. plans U.S. plans Non-U.S. plans In millions of dollars 2020 2019 2018 2020 2019 2018 2020 2019 2018 2020 2019 2018 Benefits earned during the year $ — $ 1 $ 1 $ 147 $ 146 $ 146 $ — $ — $ — $ 7 $ 8 $ 9 Interest cost on benefit obligation 378 469 514 246 287 292 17 24 26 93 104 102 Expected return on assets ( 824 ) ( 821 ) ( 844 ) ( 245 ) ( 281 ) ( 291 ) ( 17 ) ( 18 ) ( 14 ) ( 77 ) ( 84 ) ( 88 ) Amortization of unrecognized: Prior service cost (benefit) 2 2 2 5 ( 4 ) ( 4 ) ( 2 ) — — ( 9 ) ( 10 ) ( 10 ) Net actuarial loss 233 200 165 70 61 53 — — ( 1 ) 20 23 29 Curtailment loss (gain) (1) — 1 1 ( 8 ) ( 6 ) ( 1 ) — — — — — — Settlement (gain) loss (1) — — — ( 1 ) 6 7 — — — — — — Total net (benefit) expense $ ( 211 ) $ ( 148 ) $ ( 161 ) $ 214 $ 209 $ 202 $ ( 2 ) $ 6 $ 11 $ 34 $ 41 $ 42 (1) Curtailment and settlement relate to repositioning and divestiture actions. Contributions The Company’s funding practice for U.S. and non-U.S. pension and postretirement plans is generally to fund to minimum funding requirements in accordance with applicable local laws and regulations. The Company may increase its contributions above the minimum required contribution, if appropriate. In addition, management has the ability to change its funding practices. For the U.S. pension plans, there were no required minimum cash contributions for 2020 or 2019. The following table summarizes the Company’s actual contributions for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, as well as expected Company contributions for 2021. Expected contributions are subject to change, since contribution decisions are affected by various factors, such as market performance, tax considerations and regulatory requirements.

(2) During 2020 and 2019, the actuarial loss is primarily due to the decline in global discount rates offset by actual return on assets due to favorable asset returns. (3) U.S. postretirement benefit plans were net of Employer Group Waiver Plan subsidy of $ 40 million and $ 22 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. (4) Curtailment and settlement (gains) losses relate to repositioning and divestiture activities. (5) The U.S. qualified pension plan is fully funded under specified Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) funding rules as of January 1, 2021 and no minimum required funding is expected for 2021. (6) The nonqualified plans of the Company are unfunded. 173 The following table shows the change in AOCI related to the Company’s pension, postretirement and post employment plans: In millions of dollars 2020 2019 2018 Beginning of year balance, net of tax (1)(2) $ ( 6,809 ) $ ( 6,257 ) $ ( 6,183 ) Actuarial assumptions changes and plan experience ( 1,464 ) ( 2,300 ) 1,288 Net asset gain (loss) due to difference between actual and expected returns 1,076 1,427 ( 1,732 ) Net amortization 318 274 214 Prior service credit (cost) 108 ( 7 ) ( 7 ) Curtailment/settlement gain (3) ( 8 ) 1 7 Foreign exchange impact and other ( 108 ) ( 66 ) 136 Change in deferred taxes, net 23 119 20 Change, net of tax $ ( 55 ) $ ( 552 ) $ ( 74 ) End of year balance, net of tax (1)(2) $ ( 6,864 ) $ ( 6,809 ) $ ( 6,257 ) (1) See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of net AOCI balance.

At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the aggregate projected benefit obligation (PBO), the aggregate accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) and the aggregate fair value of plan assets are presented for all defined benefit pension plans with a PBO in excess of plan assets and for all defined benefit pension plans with an ABO in excess of plan assets as follows: PBO exceeds fair value of plan assets ABO exceeds fair value of plan assets U.S. plans (1) Non-U.S. plans U.S. plans (1) Non-U.S. plans In millions of dollars 2020 2019 2020 2019 2020 2019 2020 2019 Projected benefit obligation $ 736 $ 13,453 $ 4,849 $ 4,445 $ 736 $ 13,453 $ 4,723 $ 2,748 Accumulated benefit obligation 734 13,447 4,400 4,041 734 13,447 4,329 2,435 Fair value of plan assets — 12,717 3,310 3,089 — 12,717 3,212 1,429 (1) As of December 31, 2020, only the nonqualified plans’ PBO and ABO exceeded plan assets; As of December 31, 2019, both the qualified and nonqualified plans’ PBO and ABO exceeded plan assets. Plan Assumptions The Company utilizes a number of assumptions to determine plan obligations and expenses. Changes in one or a combination of these assumptions will have an impact on the Company’s pension and postretirement PBO, funded status and (benefit) expense. Changes in the plans’ funded status resulting from changes in the PBO and fair value of plan assets will have a corresponding impact on Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) . The actuarial assumptions at the respective years ended December 31 in the table below are used to measure the year-end PBO and the net periodic (benefit) expense for the subsequent year (period). Since Citi’s Significant Plans are measured on a quarterly basis, the year-end rates for those plans are used to calculate the net periodic (benefit) expense for the subsequent year’s first quarter. As a result of the quarterly measurement process, the net periodic (benefit) expense for the Significant Plans is calculated at each respective quarter end based on the preceding quarter-end rates (as shown below for the U.S. and non-U.S. pension and postretirement plans). The actuarial assumptions for All Other Plans are measured annually. 174 Certain assumptions used in determining pension and postretirement benefit obligations and net benefit expense for the Company’s plans are shown in the following table: At year end 2020 2019 Discount rate U.S. plans Qualified pension 2.45 % 3.25 % Nonqualified pension 2.35 3.25 Postretirement 2.20 3.15 Non-U.S. pension plans Range (1) -0.25 to 11.15 -0.10 to 11.30 Weighted average 3.14 3.65 Non-U.S. postretirement plans Range 0.80 to 8.55 0.90 to 9.10 Weighted average 7.42 7.76 Future compensation increase rate (2) Non-U.S. pension plans Range 1.20 to 11.25 1.50 to 11.50 Weighted average 3.10 3.17 Expected return on assets U.S. plans Qualified pension 5.80 6.70 Postretirement (3) 5.80 / 1.50 6.70 / 3.00 Non-U.S. pension plans Range 0.00 to 11.50 0.00 to 11.50 Weighted average 3.39 3.95 Non-U.S. postretirement plans Range 5.95 to 8.00 6.20 to 8.00 Weighted average 7.99 7.99 (1) Due to substantial downward movement in yields, there were negative discount rates for plans with relatively short duration in major markets, such as the Eurozone and Switzerland. (2)    Not material for U.S. plans. (3)    For the year ended 2020 and 2019, the expected return on assets for the VEBA Trust was 1.50 % and 3.00 % respectively.

(2)    Due to substantial downward movement in yields, there were negative discount rates for plans with relatively short duration in major markets, such as the Eurozone and Switzerland. (3)    Not material for U.S. plans. (4)    The expected return on assets for the U.S. pension and postretirement plans was lowered from 6.70 % to 5.80 % effective January 1, 2021 to reflect the lower interest rate environment and a change in target asset allocation. 175 Discount Rate The discount rates for the U.S. pension and postretirement plans were selected by reference to a Citigroup-specific analysis using each plan’s specific cash flows and compared with high-quality corporate bond indices for reasonableness. The discount rates for the non-U.S. pension and postretirement plans are selected by reference to high-quality corporate bond rates in countries that have developed corporate bond markets. However, where developed corporate bond markets do not exist, the discount rates are selected by reference to local government bond rates with a premium added to reflect the additional risk for corporate bonds in certain countries. Effective December 31, 2019, the established rounding convention is to the nearest 5 bps for all countries. Expected Return on Assets The Company determines its assumptions for the expected return on assets for its U.S. pension and postretirement plans using a “building block” approach, which focuses on ranges of anticipated rates of return for each asset class. A weighted average range of nominal rates is then determined based on target allocations to each asset class. Market performance over a number of earlier years is evaluated covering a wide range of economic conditions to determine whether there are sound reasons for projecting any past trends. The Company considers the expected return on assets to be a long-term assessment of return expectations and does not anticipate changing this assumption unless there are significant changes in investment strategy or economic conditions. This contrasts with the selection of the discount rate and certain other assumptions, which are reconsidered annually (or quarterly for the Significant Plans) in accordance with GAAP. The expected return on assets for the U.S. pension and postretirement plans Trust was 5.80 % at December 31, 2020 and 6.70 % at December 31, 2019 and 2018. The expected return on assets reflects the expected annual appreciation of the plan assets and reduces the Company’s annual pension expense. The expected return on assets is deducted from the sum of service cost, interest cost and other components of pension expense to arrive at the net pension (benefit) expense. The following table shows the expected return on assets used in determining the Company’s pension expense compared to the actual return on assets during 2020, 2019 and 2018 for the U.S. pension and postretirement plans: U.S. plans (During the year) 2020 2019 2018 Expected return on assets U.S. pension and postretirement trust 6.70 % 6.70 % 6.80 %/ 6.70 % VEBA trust 3.00 3.00 3.00 Actual return on assets (1) U.S. pension and postretirement trust 12.84 15.20 - 3.40 VEBA trust 2.11 1.91 to 2.76 0.43 to 1.41 (1) Actual return on assets is presented net of fees. Sensitivities of Certain Key Assumptions The following tables summarize the effect on pension expense: Discount rate One-percentage-point increase In millions of dollars 2020 2019 2018 U.S. plans $ 34 $ 28 $ 25 Non-U.S. plans ( 16 ) ( 19 ) ( 22 ) One-percentage-point decrease In millions of dollars 2020 2019 2018 U.S. plans $ ( 52 ) $ ( 44 ) $ ( 37 ) Non-U.S. plans 25 32 32 The U.S. Qualified Pension Plan was frozen in 2008, and as a result, most service costs have been eliminated. The pension expense for the U.S. Qualified Pension Plan is therefore driven primarily by interest cost rather than by service cost. An increase in the discount rate generally increases pension expense. For Non-U.S. Pension Plans that are not frozen (in countries such as Mexico, the U.K. and South Korea), there is more service cost. The pension expense for the Non-U.S. Plans is driven by both service cost and interest cost. An increase in the discount rate generally decreases pension expense due to the greater impact on service cost compared to interest cost. Since the U.S. Qualified Pension Plan was frozen, most of the prospective service cost has been eliminated and the gain/loss amortization period was changed to the life expectancy for inactive participants. As a result, pension expense for the U.S. Qualified Pension Plan is driven more by interest costs than service costs, and an increase in the discount rate would increase pension expense, while a decrease in the discount rate would decrease pension expense. The following tables summarize the effect on pension expense: Expected return on assets One-percentage-point increase In millions of dollars 2020 2019 2018 U.S. plans $ ( 123 ) $ ( 123 ) $ ( 126 ) Non-U.S. plans ( 66 ) ( 64 ) ( 64 ) One-percentage-point decrease In millions of dollars 2020 2019 2018 U.S. plans $ 123 $ 123 $ 126 Non-U.S. plans 66 64 64 176 Health Care Cost Trend Rate Assumed health care cost trend rates were as follows: 2020 2019 Health care cost increase rate for U.S. plans Following year 6.50 % 6.75 % Ultimate rate to which cost increase is assumed to decline 5.00 5.00 Year in which the ultimate rate is reached 2027 2027 Health care cost increase rate for non-U.S. plans (weighted average) Following year 6.85 % 6.85 % Ultimate rate to which cost increase is assumed to decline 6.85 6.85 Year in which the ultimate rate is reached 2021 2020 Interest Crediting Rate The Company has cash balance plans and other plans with promised interest crediting rates. For these plans, the interest crediting rates are set in line with plan rules or country legislation and do not change with market conditions. Weighted average interest crediting rate At year end 2020 2019 2018 U.S. plans 1.45 % 2.25 % 3.25 % Non-U.S. plans 1.60 1.61 1.68 Plan Assets Citigroup’s pension and postretirement plans’ asset allocations for the U.S. plans and the target allocations by asset category based on asset fair values, are as follows: Target asset allocation U.S. pension assets at December 31, U.S. postretirement assets at December 31, Asset category (1) 2021 2020 2019 2020 2019 Equity securities (2) 0 – 26 % 16 % 17 % 16 % 17 % Debt securities (3) 35 – 82 59 58 59 58 Real estate 0 – 7 4 4 4 4 Private equity 0 – 10 3 3 3 3 Other investments 0 – 30 18 18 18 18 Total 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % (1) Asset allocations for the U.S. plans are set by investment strategy, not by investment product. For example, private equities with an underlying investment in real estate are classified in the real estate asset category, not private equity. (2) Equity securities in the U.S. pension and postretirement plans do not include any Citigroup common stock at the end of 2020 and 2019. (3) The VEBA Trust for postretirement benefits is primarily invested in cash equivalents and debt securities in 2020 and 2019 and is not reflected in the table above. Third-party investment managers and advisors provide their services to Citigroup’s U.S. pension and postretirement plans. Assets are rebalanced as the Company’s Pension Plan Investment Committee deems appropriate. Citigroup’s investment strategy, with respect to its assets, is to maintain a globally diversified investment portfolio across several asset classes that, when combined with Citigroup’s contributions to the plans, will maintain the plans’ ability to meet all required benefit obligations. Citigroup’s pension and postretirement plans’ weighted-average asset allocations for the non-U.S. plans and the actual ranges, and the weighted-average target allocations by asset category based on asset fair values, are as follows: Non-U.S. pension plans Target asset allocation Actual range at December 31, Weighted-average at December 31, Asset category (1) 2021 2020 2019 2020 2019 Equity securities 0 – 100 % 0 – 100 % 0 – 100 % 15 % 13 % Debt securities 0 – 100 0 – 100 0 – 100 77 80 Real estate 0 – 15 0 – 12 0 – 15 1 1 Other investments 0 – 100 0 – 100 0 – 100 7 6 Total 100 % 100 % (1) Similar to the U.S. plans, asset allocations for certain non-U.S. plans are set by investment strategy, not by investment product. 177 Non-U.S. postretirement plans Target asset allocation Actual range at December 31, Weighted-average at December 31, Asset category (1) 2021 2020 2019 2020 2019 Equity securities 0 – 38 % 0 – 38 % 0 – 31 % 38 % 27 % Debt securities 56 – 100 56 – 100 66 – 100 56 71 Other investments 0 – 6 0 – 6 0 – 3 6 2 Total 100 % 100 % (1) Similar to the U.S. plans, asset allocations for certain non-U.S. plans are set by investment strategy, not by investment product. Fair Value Disclosure For information on fair value measurements, including descriptions of Levels 1, 2 and 3 of the fair value hierarchy and the valuation methodology utilized by the Company, see Notes 1 and 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Investments measured using the NAV per share practical expedient are excluded from Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 in the tables below. Certain investments may transfer between the fair value hierarchy classifications during the year due to changes in valuation methodology and pricing sources.

The investment strategies are targeted to produce a total return that, when combined with the Company’s contributions to the funds, will maintain the funds’ ability to meet all required benefit obligations. Risk is controlled through diversification of asset types and investments in domestic and international equities, fixed income securities and cash and short-term investments. The target asset allocation in most locations outside the U.S. is primarily in equity and debt securities. These allocations may vary by geographic region and country depending on the nature of applicable obligations and various other regional considerations. The wide variation in the actual range of plan asset allocations for the funded non-U.S. plans is a result of differing local statutory requirements and economic conditions. For example, in certain countries local law requires that all pension plan assets must be invested in fixed income investments, government funds or local-country securities. Significant Concentrations of Risk in Plan Assets The assets of the Company’s pension plans are diversified to limit the impact of any individual investment. The U.S. qualified pension plan is diversified across multiple asset classes, with publicly traded fixed income, publicly traded equity, hedge funds, and real estate representing the most significant asset allocations. Investments in these four asset classes are further diversified across funds, managers, strategies, vintages, sectors and geographies, depending on the specific characteristics of each asset class. The pension assets for the Company’s non-U.S. Significant Plans are primarily invested in publicly traded fixed income and publicly traded equity securities. Oversight and Risk Management Practices The framework for the Company’s pension oversight process includes monitoring of retirement plans by plan fiduciaries and/or management at the global, regional or country level, as appropriate. Independent Risk Management contributes to the risk oversight and monitoring for the Company’s U.S. qualified pension plan and non-U.S. Significant Pension Plans. Although the specific components of the oversight process are tailored to the requirements of each region, country and plan, the following elements are common to the Company’s monitoring and risk management process: • periodic asset/liability management studies and strategic asset allocation reviews; • periodic monitoring of funding levels and funding ratios; • periodic monitoring of compliance with asset allocation guidelines; • periodic monitoring of asset class and/or investment manager performance against benchmarks; and • periodic risk capital analysis and stress testing. Estimated Future Benefit Payments The Company expects to pay the following estimated benefit payments in future years: Pension plans Postretirement benefit plans In millions of dollars U.S. plans Non-U.S. plans U.S. plans Non-U.S. plans 2021 $ 820 $ 566 $ 58 $ 76 2022 832 504 55 80 2023 847 507 52 85 2024 852 521 49 90 2025 857 527 45 96 2026–2030 4,101 2,698 181 550 Post Employment Plans The Company sponsors U.S. post employment plans that provide income continuation and health and welfare benefits to certain eligible U.S. employees on long-term disability.

The most significant defined contribution plan is the Citi Retirement Savings Plan sponsored by the Company in the U.S. Under the Citi Retirement Savings Plan, eligible U.S. employees received matching contributions of up to 6 % of their eligible compensation for 2020 and 2019, subject to statutory limits. In addition, for eligible employees whose eligible compensation is $ 100,000 or less, a fixed contribution of up to 2 % of eligible compensation is provided. All Company contributions are invested according to participants’ individual elections. The following tables summarize the Company contributions for the defined contribution plans: U.S. plans In millions of dollars 2020 2019 2018 Company contributions $ 414 $ 404 $ 396 Non-U.S. plans In millions of dollars 2020 2019 2018 Company contributions $ 304 $ 281 $ 283 182 9.

Deferred Income Taxes Deferred income taxes at December 31 related to the following: In millions of dollars 2020 2019 Deferred tax assets Credit loss deduction $ 6,791 $ 3,809 Deferred compensation and employee benefits 2,510 2,224 U.S. tax on non-U.S. earnings 1,195 1,030 Investment and loan basis differences 1,486 2,727 Tax credit and net operating loss carry-forwards 17,416 19,711 Fixed assets and leases 2,935 2,607 Other deferred tax assets 3,832 3,341 Gross deferred tax assets $ 36,165 $ 35,449 Valuation allowance $ 5,177 $ 6,476 Deferred tax assets after valuation allowance $ 30,988 $ 28,973 Deferred tax liabilities Intangibles and leases $ ( 2,526 ) $ ( 2,640 ) Debt issuances ( 50 ) ( 201 ) Non-U.S. withholding taxes ( 921 ) ( 974 ) Interest-related items ( 597 ) ( 587 ) Other deferred tax liabilities ( 2,054 ) ( 1,477 ) Gross deferred tax liabilities $ ( 6,148 ) $ ( 5,879 ) Net deferred tax assets $ 24,840 $ 23,094 183 Unrecognized Tax Benefits The following is a rollforward of the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits: In millions of dollars 2020 2019 2018 Total unrecognized tax benefits at January 1 $ 721 $ 607 $ 1,013 Net amount of increases for current year’s tax positions 51 50 40 Gross amount of increases for prior years’ tax positions 217 151 46 Gross amount of decreases for prior years’ tax positions ( 74 ) ( 44 ) ( 174 ) Amounts of decreases relating to settlements ( 40 ) ( 21 ) ( 283 ) Reductions due to lapse of statutes of limitation ( 13 ) ( 23 ) ( 23 ) Foreign exchange, acquisitions and dispositions ( 1 ) 1 ( 12 ) Total unrecognized tax benefits at December 31 $ 861 $ 721 $ 607 The total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 that, if recognized, would affect Citi’s tax expense are $ 0.7 billion, $ 0.6 billion and $ 0.4 billion, respectively. The remaining uncertain tax positions have offsetting amounts in other jurisdictions or are temporary differences. Interest and penalties (not included in unrecognized tax benefits above) are a component of Provision for income taxes . 2020 2019 2018 In millions of dollars Pretax Net of tax Pretax Net of tax Pretax Net of tax Total interest and penalties on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at January 1 $ 100 $ 82 $ 103 $ 85 $ 121 $ 101 Total interest and penalties in the Consolidated Statement of Income 14 10 ( 4 ) ( 4 ) 6 6 Total interest and penalties on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31 (1) 118 96 100 82 103 85 (1) Includes $ 4 million, $ 3 million and $ 2 million for non-U.S. penalties in 2020, 2019 and 2018. Also includes $ 1 million, $ 1 million and $ 1 million for state penalties in 2020, 2019 and 2018. As of December 31, 2020, Citi was under audit by the Internal Revenue Service and other major taxing jurisdictions around the world. It is thus reasonably possible that significant changes in the gross balance of unrecognized tax benefits may occur within the next 12 months.The potential range of amounts that could affect Citi’s effective tax rate is between $ 0 and $ 150 million. The following are the major tax jurisdictions in which the Company and its affiliates operate and the earliest tax year subject to examination: Jurisdiction Tax year United States 2016 Mexico 2016 New York State and City 2009 United Kingdom 2016 India 2016 Singapore 2011 Hong Kong 2014 Ireland 2016 Non-U.S. Earnings Non-U.S. pretax earnings approximated $ 13.8 billion in 2020, $ 16.7 billion in 2019 and $ 16.1 billion in 2018. As a U.S. corporation, Citigroup and its U.S. subsidiaries are currently subject to U.S. taxation on all non-U.S. pretax earnings of non-U.S. branches. Beginning in 2018, there is a separate foreign tax credit (FTC) basket for branches. Also, dividends from a non-U.S. subsidiary or affiliate are effectively exempt from U.S. taxation. The Company provides income taxes on the book over tax basis differences of non-U.S. subsidiaries except to the extent that such differences are indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. At December 31, 2020, $ 11.0 billion of basis differences of non-U.S. entities was indefinitely invested. At the existing tax rates, additional taxes (net of U.S. FTCs) of $ 4.3 billion would have to be provided if such assertions were reversed. Income taxes are not provided for the Company’s “savings bank base year bad debt reserves” that arose before 1988, because under current U.S. tax rules, such taxes will become payable only to the extent that such amounts are distributed in excess of limits prescribed by federal law. At December 31, 2020, the amount of the base year reserves totaled approximately $ 358 million (subject to a tax of $ 75 million). 184 Deferred Tax Assets As of December 31, 2020, Citi had a valuation allowance of $ 5.2 billion, composed of valuation allowances of $ 1.0 billion on its general basket FTC carry-forwards, $ 2.4 billion on its branch basket FTC carry-forwards, $ 1.0 billion on its U.S. residual DTA related to its non-U.S. branches, $ 0.6 billion on local non-U.S. DTAs and $ 0.2 billion on state net operating loss carry-forwards. The amount of Citi’s valuation allowances (VA) may change in future years. In 2020, Citi’s VA for carry-forward FTCs in its branch basket decreased by $ 1.0 billion and the related VA for the U.S. tax effect on non-U.S. branch temporary differences increased by $ 0.2 billion. Of this total branch-related change of $ 0.8 billion, $ 0.6 billion impacted the tax provision as discussed below. The remainder of the branch basket-related VA decrease of $ 0.2 billion was primarily due to carry-forward expirations and changes in foreign exchange rates. The level of branch pretax income, the local branch tax rate and the allocations of Overall Domestic Loss (ODL) and expenses for U.S. tax purposes to the branch basket are the main factors in determining the branch VA. Citi computed these factors for 2020. While the COVID-19 pandemic reduced branch earnings, the allocated ODL was not diminished since a large portion of the pandemic losses will not be recognizable for U.S. taxable income until a future period. In addition, lower than forecasted U.S. interest rates resulted in a lower allocation of interest expense to non-U.S. branches. The combination of the factors enumerated are reflected in the VA release of $ 0.5 billion in Citi’s full-year effective tax rate. Citi also released branch basket VA of $ 0.1 billion in the fourth quarter, with respect to future years, based upon Citi’s Operating Plan and estimates of future branch basket factors, as outlined above. In Citi’s general basket for FTCs, changes in the forecasted amount of income in U.S. locations derived from sources outside the U.S., in addition to tax examination changes from prior years, could alter the amount of valuation allowance that is needed against such FTCs. The valuation allowance for the general basket decreased by $ 0.1 billion to $ 1.0 billion, primarily due to the expiration of carry-forwards in 2020. In the general FTC basket, foreign source income, an important driver in the utilization of FTC carry-forwards for the current year and future years, has been reduced due to the compression in interest rate spreads. The pandemic has otherwise reduced U.S. income, which impacts ODL usage and, correspondingly, the utilization of FTC carry-forwards. Accordingly, management identified actions, which became prudent due to the effects of the pandemic, to increase future foreign source income and U.S. taxable income. These planning actions include geographic asset movements, deferral of future FTC recognition and capitalization of expenses for tax purposes, resulting in no tax provision change to Citi’s general basket VA in 2020. In light of the pandemic, Citi will continue to monitor its forecasts and mix of earnings, which could affect Citi’s valuation allowance against FTC carry-forwards. Citi continues to look for additional actions that are prudent and feasible, taking into account client, regulatory and operational considerations. The valuation allowance for U.S. residual DTA related to its non-U.S. branches increased from $ 0.8 billion to $ 1.0 billion, primarily due to higher capitalized expenses. In addition, the non-U.S. local valuation allowance was reduced from $ 1.0 billion to $ 0.6 billion, primarily due to an expiration of NOL carry-forwards in a non-U.S. jurisdiction. The following table summarizes Citi’s DTAs: In billions of dollars Jurisdiction/component (1) DTAs balance December 31, 2020 DTAs balance December 31, 2019 U.S. federal (2) Net operating losses (NOLs) (3) $ 3.0 $ 2.8 Foreign tax credits (FTCs) 4.4 6.3 General business credits (GBCs) 3.6 2.5 Future tax deductions and credits 7.9 6.2 Total U.S. federal $ 18.9 $ 17.8 State and local New York NOLs $ 1.5 $ 1.7 Other state NOLs 0.1 0.2 Future tax deductions 1.7 1.3 Total state and local $ 3.3 $ 3.2 Non-U.S. NOLs $ 0.6 $ 0.5 Future tax deductions 2.0 1.6 Total non-U.S. $ 2.6 $ 2.1 Total $ 24.8 $ 23.1 (1) All amounts are net of valuation allowances.

(2) Pretax. The time remaining for utilization of the FTC component has shortened, given the passage of time. Although realization is not assured, Citi believes that the realization of the recognized net DTAs of $ 24.8 billion at December 31, 2020 is more-likely-than-not, based upon expectations as to future taxable income in the jurisdictions in which the DTAs arise and consideration of available tax planning strategies (as defined in ASC 740, Income Taxes ). The majority of Citi’s U.S. federal net operating loss carry-forward and all of its New York State and City net operating loss carry-forwards, are subject to a carry-forward period of 20 years. This provides enough time to fully utilize the DTAs pertaining to these existing NOL carry-forwards. This is due to Citi’s forecast of sufficient U.S. taxable income and the fact that New York State and City continue to tax Citi’s non-U.S. income. With respect to the FTCs component of the DTAs, the carry-forward period is 10 years. Utilization of FTCs in any year is generally limited to 21 % of foreign source taxable income in that year. However, overall domestic losses that Citi has incurred of approximately $ 26 billion as of December 31, 2020 are allowed to be reclassified as foreign source income to the extent of 50 %– 100 % (at taxpayer’s election) of domestic source income produced in subsequent years. Such resulting foreign source income would substantially cover the FTC carry-forwards after valuation allowance. As noted in the tables above, Citi’s FTC carry-forwards were $ 4.4 billion ($ 7.8 billion before valuation allowance) as of December 31, 2020, compared to $ 6.3 billion as of December 31, 2019. Citi believes that it will generate sufficient U.S. taxable income within the 10-year carry-forward period to be able to utilize the net FTCs after the valuation allowance, after considering any FTCs produced in the tax return for such period, which must be used prior to any carry-forward utilization. 186 10. EARNINGS PER SHARE The following table reconciles the income and share data used in the basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) computations: In millions of dollars, except per share amounts 2020 2019 2018 Earnings per common share Income from continuing operations before attribution of noncontrolling interests $ 11,107 $ 19,471 $ 18,088 Less: Noncontrolling interests from continuing operations 40 66 35 Net income from continuing operations (for EPS purposes) $ 11,067 $ 19,405 $ 18,053 Loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes ( 20 ) ( 4 ) ( 8 ) Citigroup’s net income $ 11,047 $ 19,401 $ 18,045 Less: Preferred dividends (1) 1,095 1,109 1,174 Net income available to common shareholders $ 9,952 $ 18,292 $ 16,871 Less: Dividends and undistributed earnings allocated to employee restricted and deferred shares with rights to dividends, applicable to basic EPS 73 121 200 Net income allocated to common shareholders for basic EPS $ 9,879 $ 18,171 $ 16,671 Weighted-average common shares outstanding applicable to basic EPS (in millions) 2,085.8 2,249.2 2,493.3 Basic earnings per share (2) Income from continuing operations $ 4.75 $ 8.08 $ 6.69 Discontinued operations ( 0.01 ) — — Net income per share—basic $ 4.74 $ 8.08 $ 6.69 Net income allocated to common shareholders for basic EPS $ 9,879 $ 18,171 $ 16,671 Add back: Dividends allocated to employee restricted and deferred shares with rights to dividends that are forfeitable 30 33 — Net income allocated to common shareholders for diluted EPS $ 9,909 $ 18,204 $ 16,671 Weighted-average common shares outstanding applicable to basic EPS (in millions) $ 2,085.8 $ 2,249.2 $ 2,493.3 Effect of dilutive securities Options (3) 0.1 0.1 0.1 Other employee plans 13.1 16.0 1.4 Adjusted weighted-average common shares outstanding applicable to diluted EPS (in millions) (4) 2,099.0 2,265.3 2,494.8 Diluted earnings per share (2) Income from continuing operations $ 4.73 $ 8.04 $ 6.69 Discontinued operations ( 0.01 ) — — Net income per share—diluted $ 4.72 $ 8.04 $ 6.68 (1) See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the potential future impact of preferred stock dividends. (2) Due to rounding, earnings per share on continuing operations and discontinued operations may not sum to earnings per share on net income. (3) During 2020, weighted-average options to purchase 0.1 million shares of common stock were outstanding but not included in the computation of earnings per share because the weighted-average exercise price of $ 56.25 per share was anti-dilutive. During 2019, no significant options to purchase shares of common stock were outstanding. During 2018, weighted-average options to purchase 0.5 million shares of common stock were outstanding but not included in the computation of earnings per share because the weighted-average exercise prices of $ 145.69 per share was anti-dilutive. (4) Due to rounding, weighted-average common shares outstanding applicable to basic EPS and the effect of dilutive securities may not sum to weighted-average common shares outstanding applicable to diluted EPS. 187 11. SECURITIES BORROWED, LOANED AND SUBJECT TO REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS Securities borrowed and purchased under agreements to resell , at their respective carrying values, consisted of the following: December 31, In millions of dollars 2020 2019 Securities purchased under agreements to resell $ 204,655 $ 169,874 Deposits paid for securities borrowed 90,067 81,448 Total, net (1) $ 294,722 $ 251,322 Allowance for credit losses on securities purchased and borrowed (2) ( 10 ) — Total, net of allowance $ 294,712 $ 251,322 Securities loaned and sold under agreements to repurchase , at their respective carrying values, consisted of the following: December 31, In millions of dollars 2020 2019 Securities sold under agreements to repurchase $ 181,194 $ 155,164 Deposits received for securities loaned 18,331 11,175 Total, net (1) $ 199,525 $ 166,339 (1)     The above tables do not include securities-for-securities lending transactions of $ 6.8 billion and $ 6.3 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, where the Company acts as lender and receives securities that can be sold or pledged as collateral. In these transactions, the Company recognizes the securities received at fair value within Other assets and the obligation to return those securities as a liability within Brokerage payables . (2)    See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. The resale and repurchase agreements represent collateralized financing transactions. Citi executes these transactions primarily through its broker-dealer subsidiaries to facilitate customer matched-book activity and to efficiently fund a portion of Citi’s trading inventory. Transactions executed by Citi’s bank subsidiaries primarily facilitate customer financing activity. To maintain reliable funding under a wide range of market conditions, including under periods of stress, Citi manages these activities by taking into consideration the quality of the underlying collateral and stipulating financing tenor. Citi manages the risks in its collateralized financing transactions by conducting daily stress tests to account for changes in capacity, tenors, haircut, collateral profile and client actions. In addition, Citi maintains counterparty diversification by establishing concentration triggers and assessing counterparty reliability and stability under stress. It is the Company’s policy to take possession of the underlying collateral, monitor its market value relative to the amounts due under the agreements and, when necessary, require prompt transfer of additional collateral in order to maintain contractual margin protection. For resale and repurchase agreements, when necessary, the Company posts additional collateral in order to maintain contractual margin protection. Collateral typically consists of government and government-agency securities, corporate and municipal bonds, equities and mortgage- and other asset-backed securities. The resale and repurchase agreements are generally documented under industry standard agreements that allow the prompt close-out of all transactions (including the liquidation of securities held) and the offsetting of obligations to return cash or securities by the non-defaulting party, following a payment default or other type of default under the relevant master agreement. Events of default generally include (i) failure to deliver cash or securities as required under the transaction, (ii) failure to provide or return cash or securities as used for margining purposes, (iii) breach of representation, (iv) cross-default to another transaction entered into among the parties, or, in some cases, their affiliates and (v) a repudiation of obligations under the agreement. The counterparty that receives the securities in these transactions is generally unrestricted in its use of the securities, with the exception of transactions executed on a tri-party basis, where the collateral is maintained by a custodian and operational limitations may restrict its use of the securities. A substantial portion of the resale and repurchase agreements is recorded at fair value, as described in Notes 24 and 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The remaining portion is carried at the amount of cash initially advanced or received, plus accrued interest, as specified in the respective agreements. The securities borrowing and lending agreements also represent collateralized financing transactions similar to the resale and repurchase agreements. Collateral typically consists of government and government-agency securities and corporate debt and equity securities. Similar to the resale and repurchase agreements, securities borrowing and lending agreements are generally documented under industry standard agreements that allow the prompt close-out of all transactions (including the liquidation of securities held) and the offsetting of obligations to return cash or securities by the non-defaulting party, following a payment default or other default by the other party under the relevant master agreement. Events of default and rights to use securities under the securities borrowing and lending agreements are similar to the resale and repurchase agreements referenced above. A substantial portion of securities borrowing and lending agreements is recorded at the amount of cash advanced or received. The remaining portion is recorded at fair value as the Company elected the fair value option for certain securities borrowed and loaned portfolios, as described in Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. With respect to securities loaned, the Company receives cash collateral in an amount generally in excess of the market value of the securities loaned. The Company monitors the market value of securities borrowed and securities loaned on a daily basis and obtains or posts additional collateral in order to maintain contractual margin protection. 188 The enforceability of offsetting rights incorporated in the master netting agreements for resale and repurchase agreements, and securities borrowing and lending agreements, is evidenced to the extent that (i) a supportive legal opinion has been obtained from counsel of recognized standing that provides the requisite level of certainty regarding the enforceability of these agreements and (ii) the exercise of rights by the non-defaulting party to terminate and close out transactions on a net basis under these agreements will not be stayed or avoided under applicable law upon an event of default including bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceeding. A legal opinion may not have been sought or obtained for certain jurisdictions where local law is silent or sufficiently ambiguous to determine the enforceability of offsetting rights or where adverse case law or conflicting regulation may cast doubt on the enforceability of such rights. In some jurisdictions and for some counterparty types, the insolvency law for a particular counterparty type may be nonexistent or unclear as overlapping regimes may exist. For example, this may be the case for certain sovereigns, municipalities, central banks and U.S. pension plans. The following tables present the gross and net resale and repurchase agreements and securities borrowing and lending agreements and the related offsetting amounts permitted under ASC 210-20-45. The tables also include amounts related to financial instruments that are not permitted to be offset under ASC 210-20-45, but would be eligible for offsetting to the extent that an event of default has occurred and a legal opinion supporting enforceability of the offsetting rights has been obtained. Remaining exposures continue to be secured by financial collateral, but the Company may not have sought or been able to obtain a legal opinion evidencing enforceability of the offsetting right.

BROKERAGE RECEIVABLES AND BROKERAGE PAYABLES The Company has receivables and payables for financial instruments sold to and purchased from brokers, dealers and customers, which arise in the ordinary course of business. Citi is exposed to risk of loss from the inability of brokers, dealers or customers to pay for purchases or to deliver the financial instruments sold, in which case Citi would have to sell or purchase the financial instruments at prevailing market prices. Credit risk is reduced to the extent that an exchange or clearing organization acts as a counterparty to the transaction and replaces the broker, dealer or customer in question. Citi seeks to protect itself from the risks associated with customer activities by requiring customers to maintain margin collateral in compliance with regulatory and internal guidelines. Margin levels are monitored daily, and customers deposit additional collateral as required. Where customers cannot meet collateral requirements, Citi may liquidate sufficient underlying financial instruments to bring the customer into compliance with the required margin level. Exposure to credit risk is impacted by market volatility, which may impair the ability of clients to satisfy their obligations to Citi. Credit limits are established and closely monitored for customers and for brokers and dealers engaged in forwards, futures and other transactions deemed to be credit sensitive. Brokerage receivables and Brokerage payables consisted of the following: December 31, In millions of dollars 2020 2019 Receivables from customers $ 18,097 $ 15,912 Receivables from brokers, dealers and clearing organizations 26,709 23,945 Total brokerage receivables (1) $ 44,806 $ 39,857 Payables to customers $ 39,319 $ 37,613 Payables to brokers, dealers and clearing organizations 11,165 10,988 Total brokerage payables (1) $ 50,484 $ 48,601 (1)     Includes brokerage receivables and payables recorded by Citi broker-dealer entities that are accounted for in accordance with the AICPA Accounting Guide for Brokers and Dealers in Securities as codified in ASC 940-320. 191 13. INVESTMENTS The following table presents Citi’s investments by category: December 31, In millions of dollars 2020 2019 Debt securities available-for-sale (AFS) $ 335,084 $ 280,265 Debt securities held-to-maturity (HTM) (1) 104,943 80,775 Marketable equity securities carried at fair value (2) 515 458 Non-marketable equity securities carried at fair value (2) 551 704 Non-marketable equity securities measured using the measurement alternative (3) 962 700 Non-marketable equity securities carried at cost (4) 5,304 5,661 Total investments $ 447,359 $ 368,563 (1) Carried at adjusted amortized cost basis, net of any ACL. (2) Unrealized gains and losses are recognized in earnings. (3) Impairment losses and adjustments to the carrying value as a result of observable price changes are recognized in earnings. See “Non-Marketable Equity Securities Not Carried at Fair Value” below. (4) Represents shares issued by the Federal Reserve Bank, Federal Home Loan Banks and certain exchanges of which Citigroup is a member. The following table presents interest and dividend income on investments: In millions of dollars 2020 2019 2018 Taxable interest $ 7,554 $ 9,269 $ 8,704 Interest exempt from U.S. federal income tax 301 404 521 Dividend income 134 187 269 Total interest and dividend income on investments $ 7,989 $ 9,860 $ 9,494 The following table presents realized gains and losses on the sales of investments, which exclude impairment losses: In millions of dollars 2020 2019 2018 Gross realized investment gains $ 1,895 $ 1,599 $ 682 Gross realized investment losses ( 139 ) ( 125 ) ( 261 ) Net realized gains on sales of investments $ 1,756 $ 1,474 $ 421 192 The Company from time to time may sell certain debt securities that were classified as HTM. These sales are in response to significant deterioration in the creditworthiness of the issuers or securities or because the Company has collected a substantial portion (at least 85 %) of the principal outstanding at acquisition of the security. In addition, certain other debt securities were reclassified to AFS investments in response to significant credit deterioration. Because the Company generally intends to sell these reclassified debt securities, Citi recorded impairment on the securities. In 2018, $ 61 million of HTM debt securities were sold and $ 8 million of HTM debt securities were reclassified to AFS in accordance with generally accepting accounting standards. There were no such activities during 2019 and 2020. Debt Securities Available-for-Sale The amortized cost and fair value of AFS debt securities were as follows: December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 In millions of dollars Amortized cost Gross unrealized gains Gross unrealized losses Allowance for credit losses Fair value Amortized cost Gross unrealized gains Gross unrealized losses Fair value Debt securities AFS Mortgage-backed securities (1) U.S. government-sponsored agency guaranteed $ 42,836 $ 1,134 $ 52 $ — $ 43,918 $ 34,963 $ 547 $ 280 $ 35,230 Non-U.S. residential 568 3 — — 571 789 3 — 792 Commercial 49 1 — — 50 75 — — 75 Total mortgage-backed securities $ 43,453 $ 1,138 $ 52 $ — $ 44,539 $ 35,827 $ 550 $ 280 $ 36,097 U.S. Treasury and federal agency securities U.S. Treasury $ 144,094 $ 2,108 $ 49 $ — $ 146,153 $ 106,429 $ 50 $ 380 $ 106,099 Agency obligations 50 1 — — 51 5,336 3 20 5,319 Total U.S. Treasury and federal agency securities $ 144,144 $ 2,109 $ 49 $ — $ 146,204 $ 111,765 $ 53 $ 400 $ 111,418 State and municipal $ 3,753 $ 13 $ 47 $ — $ 3,719 $ 5,024 $ 43 $ 89 $ 4,978 Foreign government 123,467 1,623 122 — 124,968 110,958 586 241 111,303 Corporate 10,444 152 91 5 10,500 11,266 52 101 11,217 Asset-backed securities (1) 277 5 4 — 278 524 — 2 522 Other debt securities 4,871 5 — — 4,876 4,729 1 — 4,730 Total debt securities AFS $ 330,409 $ 5,045 $ 365 $ 5 $ 335,084 $ 280,093 $ 1,285 $ 1,113 $ 280,265 (1) The Company invests in mortgage- and asset-backed securities, which are typically issued by VIEs through securitization transactions. The Company’s maximum exposure to loss from these VIEs is equal to the carrying amount of the securities, which is reflected in the table above. For mortgage- and asset-backed securitizations in which the Company has other involvement, see Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. At December 31, 2020, the amortized cost of fixed income securities exceeded their fair value by $ 365 million. Of the $ 365 million, $ 280 million represented unrealized losses on fixed income investments that have been in a gross-unrealized-loss position for less than a year and, of these, 70 % were rated investment grade; and $ 85 million represented unrealized losses on fixed income investments that have been in a gross-unrealized-loss position for a year or more and, of these, 78 % were rated investment grade. Of the $ 85 million, $ 61 million represents foreign government securities. 193 The following table shows the fair value of AFS debt securities that have been in an unrealized loss position: Less than 12 months 12 months or longer Total In millions of dollars Fair value Gross unrealized losses Fair value Gross unrealized losses Fair value Gross unrealized losses December 31, 2020 Debt securities AFS Mortgage-backed securities U.S. government-sponsored agency guaranteed $ 3,588 $ 30 $ 298 $ 22 $ 3,886 $ 52 Non-U.S. residential 1 — — — 1 — Commercial 7 — 4 — 11 — Total mortgage-backed securities $ 3,596 $ 30 $ 302 $ 22 $ 3,898 $ 52 U.S. Treasury and federal agency securities U.S. Treasury $ 25,031 $ 49 $ — $ — $ 25,031 $ 49 Agency obligations 50 — — — 50 — Total U.S. Treasury and federal agency securities $ 25,081 $ 49 $ — $ — $ 25,081 $ 49 State and municipal $ 3,214 $ 47 $ 24 $ — $ 3,238 $ 47 Foreign government 29,344 61 3,502 61 32,846 122 Corporate 1,083 90 24 1 1,107 91 Asset-backed securities 194 3 39 1 233 4 Other debt securities 182 — — — 182 — Total debt securities AFS $ 62,694 $ 280 $ 3,891 $ 85 $ 66,585 $ 365 December 31, 2019 Debt securities AFS Mortgage-backed securities U.S. government-sponsored agency guaranteed $ 9,780 $ 242 $ 1,877 $ 38 $ 11,657 $ 280 Non-U.S. residential 208 — 1 — 209 — Commercial 16 — 27 — 43 — Total mortgage-backed securities $ 10,004 $ 242 $ 1,905 $ 38 $ 11,909 $ 280 U.S. Treasury and federal agency securities U.S. Treasury $ 45,484 $ 248 $ 26,907 $ 132 $ 72,391 $ 380 Agency obligations 781 2 3,897 18 4,678 20 Total U.S. Treasury and federal agency securities $ 46,265 $ 250 $ 30,804 $ 150 $ 77,069 $ 400 State and municipal $ 362 $ 62 $ 266 $ 27 $ 628 $ 89 Foreign government 35,485 149 8,170 92 43,655 241 Corporate 2,916 98 123 3 3,039 101 Asset-backed securities 112 1 166 1 278 2 Other debt securities 1,307 — — — 1,307 — Total debt securities AFS $ 96,451 $ 802 $ 41,434 $ 311 $ 137,885 $ 1,113 194 The following table presents the amortized cost and fair value of AFS debt securities by contractual maturity dates: December 31, 2020 2019 In millions of dollars Amortized cost Fair value Amortized cost Fair value Mortgage-backed securities (1) Due within 1 year $ 27 $ 27 $ 20 $ 20 After 1 but within 5 years 567 571 573 574 After 5 but within 10 years 688 757 594 626 After 10 years (2) 42,171 43,184 34,640 34,877 Total $ 43,453 $ 44,539 $ 35,827 $ 36,097 U.S. Treasury and federal agency securities Due within 1 year $ 34,834 $ 34,951 $ 40,757 $ 40,688 After 1 but within 5 years 108,160 110,091 70,128 69,850 After 5 but within 10 years 1,150 1,162 854 851 After 10 years (2) — — 26 29 Total $ 144,144 $ 146,204 $ 111,765 $ 111,418 State and municipal Due within 1 year $ 427 $ 428 $ 932 $ 932 After 1 but within 5 years 189 198 714 723 After 5 but within 10 years 276 267 195 215 After 10 years (2) 2,861 2,826 3,183 3,108 Total $ 3,753 $ 3,719 $ 5,024 $ 4,978 Foreign government Due within 1 year $ 48,133 $ 48,258 $ 42,611 $ 42,666 After 1 but within 5 years 67,365 68,586 58,820 59,071 After 5 but within 10 years 5,908 6,011 8,192 8,198 After 10 years (2) 2,061 2,113 1,335 1,368 Total $ 123,467 $ 124,968 $ 110,958 $ 111,303 All other (3) Due within 1 year $ 6,661 $ 6,665 $ 7,306 $ 7,311 After 1 but within 5 years 7,814 7,891 8,279 8,275 After 5 but within 10 years 1,018 1,034 818 797 After 10 years (2) 99 64 116 86 Total $ 15,592 $ 15,654 $ 16,519 $ 16,469 Total debt securities AFS $ 330,409 $ 335,084 $ 280,093 $ 280,265 (1) Includes mortgage-backed securities of U.S. government-sponsored agencies.

There was no allowance as of December 31, 2019 due to CECL not being adopted until January 1, 2020. (2) The Company invests in mortgage- and asset-backed securities. These securitizations are generally considered VIEs. The Company’s maximum exposure to loss from these VIEs is equal to the carrying amount of the securities, which is reflected in the table above. For mortgage- and asset-backed securitizations in which the Company has other involvement, see Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (3) In August 2020, Citibank transferred $ 13.1 billion of investments in U.S. Treasury securities from AFS classification to HTM classification in accordance with ASC 320. At the time of transfer, the securities were in an unrealized gain position of $ 144 million. The gain amounts will remain in AOCI and will be amortized over the remaining life of the securities. (4) In March 2019, Citibank transferred $ 5 billion of agency residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) from AFS classification to HTM classification in accordance with ASC 320. At the time of transfer, the securities were in an unrealized loss position of $ 56 million. The loss amounts will remain in AOCI and be amortized over the remaining life of the securities. (5) In December 2019, Citibank transferred $ 173 million of state and municipal bonds from AFS classification to HTM classification in accordance with ASC 320. At the time of transfer, the bonds were in an unrealized gain position of $ 5 million. The gain amounts will remain in AOCI and be amortized over the remaining life of the securities. 196 The Company has the positive intent and ability to hold these securities to maturity or, where applicable, to exercise any issuer call options, absent any unforeseen significant changes in circumstances, including deterioration in credit or changes in regulatory capital requirements. The net unrealized losses classified in AOCI for HTM securities primarily relate to debt securities previously classified as AFS that were transferred to HTM, and include any cumulative fair value hedge adjustments. The net unrealized loss amount also includes any non-credit-related changes in fair value of HTM debt securities that have suffered credit impairment recorded in earnings. The AOCI balance related to HTM debt securities is amortized as an adjustment of yield, in a manner consistent with the accretion of any difference between the carrying value at the transfer date and par value of the same debt securities. The table below shows the fair value of debt securities HTM that have been in an unrecognized loss position at December 31, 2019: Less than 12 months 12 months or longer Total In millions of dollars Fair value Gross unrecognized losses Fair value Gross unrecognized losses Fair value Gross unrecognized losses December 31, 2019 Debt securities HTM Mortgage-backed securities $ 3,590 $ 10 $ 1,116 $ 11 $ 4,706 $ 21 State and municipal 34 1 1,125 27 1,159 28 Foreign government 1,970 1 — — 1,970 1 Asset-backed securities 7,972 11 765 48 8,737 59 Total debt securities HTM $ 13,566 $ 23 $ 3,006 $ 86 $ 16,572 $ 109 Note: Excluded from the gross unrecognized losses presented in the table above are $( 582 ) million of net unrealized losses recorded in AOCI as of December 31, 2019, primarily related to the difference between the amortized cost and carrying value of HTM debt securities that were reclassified from AFS.

(2) Investments with no stated maturities are included as contractual maturities of greater than 10 years. Actual maturities may differ due to call or prepayment rights. (3) Includes corporate and asset-backed securities. HTM Debt Securities Delinquency and Non-Accrual Details Citi did not have any HTM securities that were delinquent or on non-accrual status at December 31, 2020. There were no purchased credit-deteriorated HTM debt securities held by the Company as of December 31, 2020. 198 Evaluating Investments for Impairment AFS Debt Securities Overview—AFS Debt Securities The Company conducts periodic reviews of all AFS debt securities with unrealized losses to evaluate whether the impairment resulted from expected credit losses or from other factors and to evaluate the Company’s intent to sell such securities. An AFS debt security is impaired when the current fair value of an individual AFS debt security is less than its amortized cost basis. The Company recognizes the entire difference between amortized cost basis and fair value in earnings for impaired AFS debt securities that Citi has an intent to sell or for which Citi believes it will more-likely-than-not be required to sell prior to recovery of the amortized cost basis. However, for those AFS debt securities that the Company does not intend to sell and is not likely to be required to sell, only the credit-related impairment is recognized in earnings by recording an ACL. Any remaining fair value decline for such securities is recorded in AOCI . The Company does not consider the length of time that the fair value of a security is below its amortized cost when determining if a credit loss exists. For AFS debt securities, credit losses exist where Citi does not expect to receive contractual principal and interest cash flows sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis of a security. The ACL is limited to the amount by which the AFS debt security’s amortized cost basis exceeds its fair value. The allowance is increased or decreased if credit conditions subsequently worsen or improve. Reversals of credit losses are recognized in earnings. The Company’s review for impairment of AFS debt securities generally entails: • identification and evaluation of impaired investments; • consideration of evidential matter, including an evaluation of factors or triggers that could cause individual positions to qualify as credit impaired and those that would not support credit impairment; and • documentation of the results of these analyses, as required under business policies. The sections below describe the Company’s process for identifying expected credit impairments for debt security types that have the most significant unrealized losses as of December 31, 2020. Mortgage-Backed Securities Citi records no allowances for credit losses on U.S. government-agency-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities, because the Company expects to incur no credit losses in the event of default due to a history of incurring no credit losses and due to the nature of the counterparties. State and Municipal Securities The process for estimating credit losses in Citigroup’s AFS state and municipal bonds is primarily based on a credit analysis that incorporates third-party credit ratings. Citi monitors the bond issuers and any insurers providing default protection in the form of financial guarantee insurance. The average external credit rating, ignoring any insurance, is Aa2/AA. In the event of an external rating downgrade or other indicator of credit impairment (i.e., based on instrument-specific estimates of cash flows or probability of issuer default), the subject bond is specifically reviewed for adverse changes in the amount or timing of expected contractual principal and interest payments. For AFS state and municipal bonds with unrealized losses that Citi plans to sell, or would more-likely-than-not be required to sell, the full impairment is recognized in earnings. For AFS state and municipal bonds where Citi has no intent to sell and it is more-likely-than-not that the Company will not be required to sell, Citi records an allowance for expected credit losses for the amount it expects not to collect, capped at the difference between the bond’s amortized cost basis and fair value. Equity Method Investments Management assesses equity method investments that have fair values that are lower than their respective carrying values for other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI). Fair value is measured as price multiplied by quantity if the investee has publicly listed securities. If the investee is not publicly listed, other methods are used (see Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). For impaired equity method investments that Citi plans to sell prior to recovery of value or would more-likely-than-not be required to sell, with no expectation that the fair value will recover prior to the expected sale date, the full impairment is recognized in earnings as OTTI regardless of severity and duration. The measurement of the OTTI does not include partial projected recoveries subsequent to the balance sheet date. For impaired equity method investments that management does not plan to sell and is not more-likely-than-not to be required to sell prior to recovery of value, the evaluation of whether an impairment is other-than-temporary is based on (i) whether and when an equity method investment will recover in value and (ii) whether the investor has the intent and ability to hold that investment for a period of time sufficient to recover the value. The determination of whether the impairment is considered other-than-temporary considers the following indicators: • the cause of the impairment and the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, including any specific events that may influence the operations of the issuer; • the intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value; and • the length of time and extent to which fair value has been less than the carrying value. 199 Recognition and Measurement of Impairment The following tables present

changes in fair value recognized in earnings unless (i) the measurement alternative is elected or (ii) the investment represents Federal Reserve Bank and Federal Home Loan Bank stock or certain exchange seats that continue to be carried at cost. The election to measure a non-marketable equity security using the measurement alternative is made on an instrument-by-instrument basis. Under the measurement alternative, an equity security is carried at cost plus or minus changes resulting from observable prices in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. The carrying value of the equity security is adjusted to fair value on the date of an observed transaction. Fair value may differ from the observed transaction price due to a number of factors, including marketability adjustments and differences in rights and obligations when the observed transaction is not for the identical investment held by Citi. Equity securities under the measurement alternative are also assessed for impairment. On a quarterly basis, management qualitatively assesses whether each equity security under the measurement alternative is impaired. Impairment indicators that are considered include, but are not limited to, the following: • a significant deterioration in the earnings performance, credit rating, asset quality or business prospects of the investee; • a significant adverse change in the regulatory, economic or technological environment of the investee; • a significant adverse change in the general market condition of either the geographical area or the industry in which the investee operates; • a bona fide offer to purchase, an offer by the investee to sell or a completed auction process for the same or similar investment for an amount less than the carrying amount of that investment; and • factors that raise significant concerns about the investee’s ability to continue as a going concern, such as negative cash flows from operations, working capital deficiencies or noncompliance with statutory capital requirements or debt covenants. When the qualitative assessment indicates that impairment exists, the investment is written down to fair value, with the full difference between the fair value of the investment and its carrying amount recognized in earnings. Below is the carrying value of non-marketable equity securities measured using the measurement alternative at December 31, 2020 and 2019: In millions of dollars December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 Measurement alternative: Carrying value $ 962 $ 700 Below are amounts recognized in earnings and life-to-date amounts for non-marketable equity securities measured using the measurement alternative: Years ended December 31, In millions of dollars 2020 2019 Measurement alternative (1) : Impairment losses $ 56 $ 9 Downward changes for observable prices 19 16 Upward changes for observable prices 144 123 (1)     See Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these nonrecurring fair value measurements. Life-to-date amounts on securities still held In millions of dollars December 31, 2020 Measurement alternative: Impairment losses $ 68 Downward changes for observable prices 53 Upward changes for observable prices 486 A similar impairment analysis is performed for non-marketable equity securities carried at cost. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, there was no impairment loss recognized in earnings for non-marketable equity securities carried at cost. 202 Investments in Alternative Investment Funds That Calculate Net Asset Value The Company holds investments in certain alternative investment funds that calculate net asset value (NAV), or its equivalent, including private equity funds, funds of funds and real estate funds, as provided by third-party asset managers. Investments in such funds are generally classified as non-marketable equity securities carried at fair value. The fair values of these investments are estimated using the NAV of the Company’s ownership interest in the funds. Some of these investments are in “covered funds” for purposes of the Volcker Rule, which prohibits certain proprietary investment activities and limits the ownership of, and relationships with, covered funds. On April 21, 2017, Citi’s request for extension of the permitted holding period under the Volcker Rule for certain of its investments in illiquid funds was approved, allowing the Company to hold such investments until the earlier of five years from the July 21, 2017 expiration date of the general conformance period or the date such investments mature or are otherwise conformed with the Volcker Rule.

(2) With respect to the Company’s investments in private equity funds and real estate funds, distributions from each fund will be received as the underlying assets held by these funds are liquidated. It is estimated that the underlying assets of these funds will be liquidated over a period of several years as market conditions allow. Private equity and real estate funds do not allow redemption of investments by their investors. Investors are permitted to sell or transfer their investments, subject to the approval of the general partner or investment manager of these funds, which generally may not be unreasonably withheld. (3) Includes several real estate funds that invest primarily in commercial real estate in the U.S., Europe and Asia. 203 14. LOANS Citigroup loans are reported in two categories: consumer and corporate. These categories are classified primarily according to the segment and subsegment that manage the loans. Consumer Loans Consumer loans represent loans and leases managed primarily by GCB and Corporate/Other. Citigroup has established a risk management process to monitor, evaluate and manage the principal risks associated with its consumer loan portfolio. Credit quality indicators that are actively monitored include delinquency status, consumer credit scores under Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) and loan to value (LTV) ratios, each as discussed in more detail below. Included in the loan table above are lending products whose terms may give rise to greater credit issues. Credit cards with below-market introductory interest rates and interest-only loans are examples of such products. These products are closely managed using credit techniques that are intended to mitigate their higher inherent risk. Delinquency Status Delinquency status is monitored and considered a key indicator of credit quality of consumer loans. Principally, the U.S. residential first mortgage loans use the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) method of reporting delinquencies, which considers a loan delinquent if a monthly payment has not been received by the end of the day immediately preceding the loan’s next due date. All other loans use a method of reporting delinquencies that considers a loan delinquent if a monthly payment has not been received by the close of business on the loan’s next due date. As a general policy, residential first mortgages, home equity loans and installment loans are classified as non-accrual when loan payments are 90 days contractually past due. Credit cards and unsecured revolving loans generally accrue interest until payments are 180 days past due. Home equity loans in regulated bank entities are classified as non-accrual if the related residential first mortgage is 90 days or more past due. Mortgage loans, other than Federal Housing Administration (FHA)-insured loans, are classified as non-accrual within 60 days of notification that the borrower has filed for bankruptcy. The policy for re-aging modified U.S. consumer loans to current status varies by product. Generally, one of the conditions to qualify for these modifications is that a minimum number of payments (typically ranging from one to three ) be made. Upon modification, the loan is re-aged to current status. However, re-aging practices for certain open-ended consumer loans, such as credit cards, are governed by Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) guidelines. For open-ended consumer loans subject to FFIEC guidelines, one of the conditions for a loan to be re-aged to current status is that at least three consecutive minimum monthly payments, or the equivalent amount, must be received. In addition, under FFIEC guidelines, the number of times that such a loan can be re-aged is subject to limitations (generally once in 12 months and twice in five years). Furthermore, FHA and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) loans are modified under those respective agencies’ guidelines and payments are not always required in order to re-age a modified loan to current. 204 The following tables provide Citi’s consumer loans by type: Consumer Loans, Delinquencies and Non-Accrual Status at December 31, 2020 In millions of dollars Total current (1)(2) 30–89 days past due (3)(4) ≥ 90 days past due (3)(4) Past due government guaranteed (5) Total loans Non-accrual loans for which there are no loan loss reserves Non-accrual loans for which there are loan loss reserves Total non-accrual 90 days past due and accruing In North America offices (6) Residential first mortgages (7) $ 46,471 $ 402 $ 381 $ 524 $ 47,778 $ 136 $ 509 $ 645 $ 332 Home equity loans (8)(9) 6,829 78 221 — 7,128 72 307 379 — Credit cards 127,827 1,228 1,330 — 130,385 — — — 1,330 Personal, small business and other 4,472 27 10 — 4,509 2 33 35 — Total $ 185,599 $ 1,735 $ 1,942 $ 524 $ 189,800 $ 210 $ 849 $ 1,059 $ 1,662 In offices outside North America (6) Residential first mortgages (7) $ 39,557 $ 213 $ 199 $ — $ 39,969 $ — $ 486 $ 486 $ — Credit cards 21,718 429 545 — 22,692 — 384 384 376 Personal, small business and other 35,925 319 134 — 36,378 — 212 212 — Total $ 97,200 $ 961 $ 878 $ — $ 99,039 $ — $ 1,082 $ 1,082 $ 376 Total Citigroup (10) $ 282,799 $ 2,696 $ 2,820 $ 524 $ 288,839 $ 210 $ 1,931 $ 2,141 $ 2,038 Consumer Loans, Delinquencies and Non-Accrual Status at December 31, 2019 In millions of dollars Total current (1)(2) 30–89 days past due (3) ≥ 90 days past due (3) Past due government guaranteed (5) Total loans Total non-accrual 90 days past due and accruing In North America offices (6) Residential first mortgages (7) $ 45,942 $ 411 $ 221 $ 434 $ 47,008 $ 479 $ 288 Home equity loans (8)(9) 8,860 174 189 — 9,223 405 — Credit cards 145,477 1,759 1,927 — 149,163 — 1,927 Personal, small business and other 3,641 44 14 — 3,699 21 — Total $ 203,920 $ 2,388 $ 2,351 $ 434 $ 209,093 $ 905 $ 2,215 In offices outside North America (6) Residential first mortgages (7) $ 37,654 $ 210 $ 160 $ — $ 38,024 $ 425 $ — Credit cards 25,111 426 372 — 25,909 310 242 Personal, small business and other 36,118 272 132 — 36,522 176 — Total $ 98,883 $ 908 $ 664 $ — $ 100,455 $ 911 $ 242 Total Citigroup (10) $ 302,803 $ 3,296 $ 3,015 $ 434 $ 309,548 $ 1,816 $ 2,457 (1) Loans less than 30 days past due are presented as current.

These scores are continually updated by the agencies based upon an individual’s credit actions (e.g., taking out a loan or missed or late payments). The following tables provide details on the FICO scores for Citi’s U.S. consumer loan portfolio based on end-of-period receivables by year of origination. FICO scores are updated monthly for substantially all of the portfolio or, otherwise, on a quarterly basis for the remaining portfolio.

Impaired consumer loans include non-accrual loans, as well as smaller-balance homogeneous loans whose terms have been modified due to the borrower’s financial difficulties and where Citi has granted a concession to the borrower. These modifications may include interest rate reductions and/or principal forgiveness. Impaired consumer loans exclude smaller-balance homogeneous loans that have not been modified and are carried on a non-accrual basis.

Mexico is included in offices outside North America. The classification between offices in North America and outside North America is based on the domicile of the booking unit. The difference between the domicile of the booking unit and the domicile of the managing unit is not material. (2) Loans secured primarily by real estate. (3) Corporate loans are net of unearned income of ($ 844 ) million and ($ 814 ) million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Unearned income on corporate loans primarily represents interest received in advance, but not yet earned, on loans originated on a discounted basis. The Company sold and/or reclassified to held-for-sale $ 2.2 billion and $ 2.6 billion of corporate loans during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Company did not have significant purchases of corporate loans classified as held-for-investment for the years ended December 31, 2020 or 2019. Lease financing Citi is a lessor in the power, railcars, shipping and aircraft sectors, where the Company has executed operating, direct financing and leveraged leases. Citi’s $ 0.7 billion of lease financing receivables, as of December 31, 2020, is composed of approximately equal balances of direct financing lease receivables and net investments in leveraged leases. Citi uses the interest rate implicit in the lease to determine the present value of its lease financing receivables. Interest income on direct financing and leveraged leases during the year ended December 31, 2020 was not material. The Company’s leases have an average remaining maturity of approximately three and a half years. In certain cases, Citi obtains residual value insurance from third parties and/or the lessee to manage the risk associated with the residual value of the leased assets. The receivable related to the residual value of the leased assets is $ 0.3 billion as of December 31, 2020, while the amount covered by residual value guarantees is $ 0.2 billion. The Company’s operating leases, where Citi is a lessor, are not significant to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Delinquency Status Citi generally does not manage corporate loans on a delinquency basis. Corporate loans are identified as impaired and placed on a cash (non-accrual) basis when it is determined, based on actual experience and a forward-looking assessment of the collectability of the loan in full, that the payment of interest or principal is doubtful or when interest or principal is 90 days past due, except when the loan is well collateralized and in the process of collection. Any interest accrued on impaired corporate loans and leases is reversed at 90 days and charged against current earnings, and interest is thereafter included in earnings only to the extent actually received in cash. When there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectability of principal, all cash receipts are thereafter applied to reduce the recorded investment in the loan. While corporate loans are generally managed based on their internally assigned risk rating (see further discussion below), the following tables present delinquency information by corporate loan type. 212 Corporate Loan Delinquencies and Non-Accrual Details at December 31, 2020 In millions of dollars 30–89 days past due and accruing (1) ≥ 90 days past due and accruing (1) Total past due and accruing Total non-accrual (2) Total current (3) Total loans (4) Commercial and industrial $ 400 $ 109 $ 509 $ 2,795 $ 153,036 $ 156,340 Financial institutions 668 65 733 92 86,864 87,689 Mortgage and real estate 450 247 697 505 70,836 72,038 Lease financing 62 12 74 24 640 738 Other 112 19 131 111 63,157 63,399 Loans at fair value 6,840 Total $ 1,692 $ 452 $ 2,144 $ 3,527 $ 374,533 $ 387,044 Corporate Loan Delinquencies and Non-Accrual Details at December 31, 2019 In millions of dollars 30–89 days past due and accruing (1) ≥ 90 days past due and accruing (1) Total past due and accruing Total non-accrual (2) Total current (3) Total loans (4) Commercial and industrial $ 676 $ 93 $ 769 $ 1,828 $ 164,249 $ 166,846 Financial institutions 791 3 794 50 91,008 91,852 Mortgage and real estate 534 4 538 188 62,425 63,151 Lease financing 58 9 67 41 1,277 1,385 Other 190 22 212 81 62,341 62,634 Loans at fair value 4,067 Total $ 2,249 $ 131 $ 2,380 $ 2,188 $ 381,300 $ 389,935 (1) Corporate loans that are 90 days past due are generally classified as non-accrual. Corporate loans are considered past due when principal or interest is contractually due but unpaid. (2) Non-accrual loans generally include those loans that are 90 days or more past due or those loans for which Citi believes, based on actual experience and a forward-looking assessment of the collectability of the loan in full, that the payment of interest or principal is doubtful. (3) Loans less than 30 days past due are presented as current. (4) Total loans include loans at fair value, which are not included in the various delinquency columns. Citigroup has a risk management process to monitor, evaluate and manage the principal risks associated with its corporate loan portfolio. As part of its risk management process, Citi assigns numeric risk ratings to its corporate loan facilities based on quantitative and qualitative assessments of the obligor and facility. These risk ratings are reviewed at least annually or more often if material events related to the obligor or facility warrant. Factors considered in assigning the risk ratings include financial condition of the obligor, qualitative assessment of management and strategy, amount and sources of repayment, amount and type of collateral and guarantee arrangements, amount and type of any contingencies associated with the obligor and the obligor’s industry and geography. The obligor risk ratings are defined by ranges of default probabilities. The facility risk ratings are defined by ranges of loss norms, which are the product of the probability of default and the loss given default. The investment grade rating categories are similar to the category BBB-/Baa3 and above as defined by S&P and Moody’s. Loans classified according to the bank regulatory definitions as special mention, substandard and doubtful will have risk ratings within the non-investment-grade categories. 213 Corporate Loans Credit Quality Indicators Recorded investment in loans (1) Term loans by year of origination Revolving line of credit arrangements (2) Totals as of In millions of dollars 2020 2019 2018 2017 2016 Prior December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 Investment grade (3) Commercial and industrial (4) $ 38,398 $ 7,607 $ 5,929 $ 3,909 $ 2,094 $ 8,670 $ 25,819 $ 92,426 $ 110,797 Financial institutions (4) 10,560 2,964 2,106 782 681 2,030 56,239 75,362 80,533 Mortgage and real estate 6,793 6,714 5,174 2,568 1,212 1,719 1,557 25,737 27,571 Other (5) 10,874 3,566 4,597 952 780 5,290 31,696 57,755 58,155 Total investment grade $ 66,625 $ 20,851 $ 17,806 $ 8,211 $ 4,767 $ 17,709 $ 115,311 $ 251,280 $ 277,056 Non-investment grade (3) Accrual Commercial and industrial (4) $ 19,683 $ 4,794 $ 4,645 $ 2,883 $ 1,182 $ 4,533 $ 23,400 $ 61,120 $ 54,220 Financial institutions (4) 7,413 700 654 274 141 197 2,855 12,234 11,269 Mortgage and real estate 1,882 1,919 2,058 1,457 697 837 551 9,401 3,811 Other (5) 1,407 918 725 370 186 657 1,986 6,249 5,734 Non-accrual Commercial and industrial (4) 260 203 192 143 57 223 1,717 2,795 1,828 Financial institutions 1 — — — — — 91 92 50 Mortgage and real estate 13 4 3 18 8 32 427 505 188 Other (5) 15 3 12 29 2 65 9 135 122 Total non-investment grade $ 30,674 $ 8,541 $ 8,289 $ 5,174 $ 2,273 $ 6,544 $ 31,036 $ 92,531 $ 77,222 Non-rated private bank loans managed on a delinquency basis (3)(6) $ 9,823 $ 7,121 $ 3,533 $ 3,674 $ 4,300 $ 7,942 $ — $ 36,393 $ 31,590 Loans at fair value (7) 6,840 4,067 Corporate loans, net of unearned income $ 107,122 $ 36,513 $ 29,628 $ 17,059 $ 11,340 $ 32,195 $ 146,347 $ 387,044 $ 389,935 (1) Recorded investment in a loan includes net deferred loan fees and costs, unamortized premium or discount, less any direct write-downs.

(4) Includes certain short-term loans with less than one year in tenor. (5) Other includes installment and other, lease financing and loans to government and official institutions. (6) Non-rated private bank loans mainly include mortgage and real estate loans to private banking clients. (7) Loans at fair value include loans to commercial and industrial, financial institutions, mortgage and real estate and other. Impaired collateral-dependent loans and leases, where repayment is expected to be provided solely by the sale of the underlying collateral and there are no other available and reliable sources of repayment, are written down to the lower of carrying value or collateral value, less cost to sell. Cash-basis loans are returned to an accrual status when all contractual principal and interest amounts are reasonably assured of repayment and there is a sustained period of repayment performance, generally six months , in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan. 214 Non-Accrual Corporate Loans The following tables present non-accrual loan information by corporate loan type and interest income recognized on non-accrual corporate loans: At and for the year ended December 31, 2020 In millions of dollars Recorded investment (1) Unpaid principal balance Related specific allowance Average carrying value (2) Interest income recognized (3) Non-accrual corporate loans Commercial and industrial $ 2,795 $ 3,664 $ 442 $ 2,649 $ 14 Financial institutions 92 181 17 132 — Mortgage and real estate 505 803 38 413 — Lease financing 24 24 — 34 — Other 111 235 18 174 21 Total non-accrual corporate loans $ 3,527 $ 4,907 $ 515 $ 3,402 $ 35 At and for the year ended December 31, 2019 In millions of dollars Recorded investment (1) Unpaid principal balance Related specific allowance Average carrying value (2) Interest income recognized (3) Non-accrual corporate loans Commercial and industrial $ 1,828 $ 1,942 $ 283 $ 1,449 $ 33 Financial institutions 50 120 2 63 — Mortgage and real estate 188 362 10 192 — Lease financing 41 41 — 8 — Other 81 202 4 76 9 Total non-accrual corporate loans $ 2,188 $ 2,667 $ 299 $ 1,788 $ 42 December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 In millions of dollars Recorded investment (1) Related specific allowance Recorded investment (1) Related specific allowance Non-accrual corporate loans with specific allowances Commercial and industrial $ 1,523 $ 442 $ 714 $ 283 Financial institutions 90 17 40 2 Mortgage and real estate 246 38 48 10 Lease financing — — — — Other 68 18 7 4 Total non-accrual corporate loans with specific allowances $ 1,927 $ 515 $ 809 $ 299 Non-accrual corporate loans without specific allowances Commercial and industrial $ 1,272 $ 1,114 Financial institutions 2 10 Mortgage and real estate 259 140 Lease financing 24 41 Other 43 74 Total non-accrual corporate loans without specific allowances $ 1,600 N/A $ 1,379 N/A (1) Recorded investment in a loan includes net deferred loan fees and costs, unamortized premium or discount, less any direct write-downs.

(2) TDRs involving changes in the amount or timing of principal payments may involve principal forgiveness or deferral of periodic and/or final principal payments. Because forgiveness of principal is rare for corporate loans, modifications typically have little to no impact on the loans’ projected cash flows and thus little to no impact on the allowance established for the loans. Charge-offs for amounts deemed uncollectible may be recorded at the time of the restructuring or may have already been recorded in prior periods such that no charge-off is required at the time of the modification. (3) TDRs involving changes in the amount or timing of interest payments may involve a below-market interest rate. The following table presents total corporate loans modified in a TDR as well as those TDRs that defaulted and for which the payment default occurred within one year of a permanent modification. Default is defined as 60 days past due, except for classifiably managed commercial banking loans, where default is defined as 90 days past due.

GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS Goodwill The changes in Goodwill by segment were as follows: In millions of dollars Global Consumer Banking Institutional Clients Group Corporate/Other Total Balance at December 31, 2017 $ 12,128 $ 10,112 $ 16 $ 22,256 Foreign exchange translation $ ( 41 ) $ ( 153 ) $ — $ ( 194 ) Divestitures (1) — — ( 16 ) ( 16 ) Balance at December 31, 2018 $ 12,087 $ 9,959 $ — $ 22,046 Foreign exchange translation $ 15 $ 65 $ — $ 80 Balance at December 31, 2019 $ 12,102 $ 10,024 $ — $ 22,126 Foreign exchange translation $ 40 $ ( 4 ) $ — $ 36 Balance at December 31, 2020 $ 12,142 $ 10,020 $ — $ 22,162 (1)    Primarily related to the sale of consumer operations in Colombia in 2018. The Company performed its annual goodwill impairment test as of July 1, 2020, at the level below each business segment (referred to as a reporting unit) which indicated that the fair values of the Company’s reporting units as a percentage of their carrying values ranged from approximately 115 % to 136 %, resulting in no impairment. While the inherent risk related to uncertainty is embedded in the key assumptions used in the valuations, the economic environment and Citi’s outlook continues to evolve due to the challenges and uncertainties related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Further deterioration in macroeconomic and market conditions, including potential adverse effects to economic forecasts due to the severity and duration of the pandemic, as well as the responses of governments, customers and clients, could negatively influence the assumptions used in the valuations, in particular, the discount rates, exit multiples and growth rates used in net income projections. If the future were to differ from management’s estimate of key assumptions (e.g., net interest revenue and loan volume), and associated cash flows were to decrease, Citi could potentially experience material goodwill impairment charges in the future. For additional information regarding Citi’s goodwill impairment testing process, see the following Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements: Note 1 for Citi’s Accounting Policy for goodwill, including the adoption of a new accounting standard regarding the subsequent measurement of goodwill, and Note 3 for a description of Citi’s Business Segments. 220 Intangible Assets The components of intangible assets were as follows: December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 In millions of dollars Gross carrying amount Accumulated amortization Net carrying amount Gross carrying amount Accumulated amortization Net carrying amount Purchased credit card relationships $ 5,648 $ 4,229 $ 1,419 $ 5,676 $ 4,059 $ 1,617 Credit card contract-related intangibles (1) 3,929 1,276 2,653 5,393 3,069 2,324 Core deposit intangibles 45 44 1 434 433 1 Other customer relationships 455 314 141 424 275 149 Present value of future profits 32 30 2 34 31 3 Indefinite-lived intangible assets 190 — 190 228 — 228 Other 72 67 5 82 77 5 Intangible assets (excluding MSRs) $ 10,371 $ 5,960 $ 4,411 $ 12,271 $ 7,944 $ 4,327 Mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) (2) 336 — 336 495 — 495 Total intangible assets $ 10,707 $ 5,960 $ 4,747 $ 12,766 $ 7,944 $ 4,822 (1) Primarily reflects contract-related intangibles associated with the American Airlines, The Home Depot, Costco and AT&T credit card program agreements, which represented 96 % of the aggregate net carrying amount as of December 31, 2020.

Borrowings under bank lines of credit may be at interest rates based on LIBOR, CD rates, the prime rate or bids submitted by the banks. Citigroup pays commitment fees for its lines of credit. Some of Citigroup’s non-bank subsidiaries have credit facilities with Citigroup’s subsidiary depository institutions, including Citibank. Borrowings under these facilities are secured in accordance with Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act. Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc. (CGMHI) has borrowing agreements consisting of facilities that CGMHI has been advised are available, but where no contractual lending obligation exists.

Certain Citigroup consolidated hedging activities are also included in this line. The Company issues both fixed- and variable-rate debt in a range of currencies. It uses derivative contracts, primarily interest rate swaps, to effectively convert a portion of its fixed-rate debt to variable-rate debt. The maturity structure of the derivatives generally corresponds to the maturity structure of the debt being hedged. In addition, the Company uses other derivative contracts to manage the foreign exchange impact of certain debt issuances. At December 31, 2020, the Company’s overall weighted average interest rate for long-term debt, excluding structured notes accounted for at fair value, was 2.66 % on a contractual basis and 2.64 % including the effects of derivative contracts. 222 Aggregate annual maturities of long-term debt obligations (based on final maturity dates) including trust preferred securities are as follows: In millions of dollars 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 Thereafter Total Citigroup Inc. $ 15,605 $ 13,159 $ 14,805 $ 12,329 $ 13,733 $ 100,933 $ 170,564 Bank 18,577 14,608 2,685 4,588 501 3,782 44,741 Broker-dealer 9,139 8,978 8,557 4,089 4,643 20,975 56,381 Total $ 43,321 $ 36,745 $ 26,047 $ 21,006 $ 18,877 $ 125,690 $ 271,686 The following table summarizes Citi’s outstanding trust preferred securities at December 31, 2020: Junior subordinated debentures owned by trust Trust Issuance date Securities issued Liquidation value (1) Coupon rate (2) Common shares issued to parent Amount Maturity Redeemable by issuer beginning In millions of dollars, except securities and share amounts Citigroup Capital III Dec. 1996 194,053 $ 194 7.625 % 6,003 $ 200 Dec. 1, 2036 Not redeemable Citigroup Capital XIII Sept. 2010 89,840,000 2,246 3 mo LIBOR + 637 bps 1,000 2,246 Oct. 30, 2040 Oct. 30, 2015 Citigroup Capital XVIII June 2007 99,901 137 3 mo Sterling LIBOR + 88.75 bps 50 137 June 28, 2067 June 28, 2017 Total obligated $ 2,577 $ 2,583 Note: Distributions on the trust preferred securities and interest on the subordinated debentures are payable semiannually for Citigroup Capital III and Citigroup Capital XVIII and quarterly for Citigroup Capital XIII.

REGULATORY CAPITAL Citigroup is subject to risk-based capital and leverage standards issued by the Federal Reserve Board, which constitute the U.S. Basel III rules. Citi’s U.S.-insured depository institution subsidiaries, including Citibank, are subject to similar standards issued by their respective primary bank regulatory agencies. These standards are used to evaluate capital adequacy and include the required minimums shown in the following table. The regulatory agencies are required by law to take specific, prompt corrective actions with respect to institutions that do not meet minimum capital standards. The following table sets forth for Citigroup and Citibank the regulatory capital tiers, total risk-weighted assets, quarterly adjusted average total assets, Total Leverage Exposure, risk-based capital ratios and leverage ratios: In millions of dollars, except ratios Stated minimum Citigroup Citibank Well- capitalized minimum December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 Well- capitalized minimum December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 Common Equity Tier 1 Capital $ 147,274 $ 137,798 $ 142,884 $ 130,720 Tier 1 Capital 167,053 155,805 144,992 132,847 Total Capital (Tier 1 Capital + Tier 2 Capital)—Standardized Approach 204,849 193,711 169,235 157,253 Total Capital (Tier 1 Capital + Tier 2 Capital)—Advanced Approaches 195,959 181,337 161,294 145,918 Total risk-weighted assets—Standardized Approach 1,221,576 1,168,848 1,030,081 1,022,607 Total risk-weighted assets—Advanced Approaches 1,255,284 1,142,804 1,012,129 938,735 Quarterly adjusted average total assets (1) 2,265,615 1,957,039 1,680,056 1,459,780 Total Leverage Exposure (2) 2,386,881 2,513,702 2,167,969 1,958,173 Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio (3) 4.5 % N/A 11.73 % 11.79 % 6.5 % 13.87 % 12.78 % Tier 1 Capital ratio (3) 6.0 6.0 % 13.31 13.33 8.0 14.08 12.99 Total Capital ratio (3) 8.0 10.0 15.61 15.87 10.0 15.94 15.38 Tier 1 Leverage ratio 4.0 N/A 7.37 7.96 5.0 8.63 9.10 Supplementary Leverage ratio 3.0 N/A 7.00 6.20 6.0 6.69 6.78 (1) Tier 1 Leverage ratio denominator.

As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, Citibank’s reportable Common Equity Tier 1 Capital and Tier 1 Capital ratios were the lower derived under the Basel III Standardized Approach, whereas the Total Capital ratios were the lower derived under the Basel III Advanced Approaches frameworks as of December 31, 2020 and the lower derived under the Standardized Approach as of December 31, 2019. N/A Not applicable As indicated in the table above, Citigroup and Citibank were “well capitalized” under the current federal bank regulatory agency definitions as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. Banking Subsidiaries—Constraints on Dividends There are various legal limitations on the ability of Citigroup’s subsidiary depository institutions to extend credit, pay dividends or otherwise supply funds to Citigroup and its non-bank subsidiaries. The approval of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is required if total dividends declared in any calendar year were to exceed amounts specified by the agency’s regulations. In determining the dividends, each subsidiary depository institution must also consider its effect on applicable risk-based capital and leverage ratio requirements, as well as policy statements of the federal bank regulatory agencies that indicate that banking organizations should generally pay dividends out of current operating earnings. Citigroup received $ 2.3 billion and $ 17.3 billion in dividends from Citibank during 2020 and 2019, respectively. 224 19.

SECURITIZATIONS AND VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES Uses of Special Purpose Entities A special purpose entity (SPE) is an entity designed to fulfill a specific limited need of the company that organized it. The principal uses of SPEs by Citi are to obtain liquidity and favorable capital treatment by securitizing certain financial assets, to assist clients in securitizing their financial assets and to create investment products for clients. SPEs may be organized in various legal forms, including trusts, partnerships or corporations. In a securitization, through the SPE’s issuance of debt and equity instruments, certificates, commercial paper or other notes of indebtedness, the company transferring assets to the SPE converts all (or a portion) of those assets into cash before they would have been realized in the normal course of business. These issuances are recorded on the balance sheet of the SPE, which may or may not be consolidated onto the balance sheet of the company that organized the SPE. Investors usually have recourse only to the assets in the SPE, but may also benefit from other credit enhancements, such as a collateral account, a line of credit or a liquidity facility, such as a liquidity put option or asset purchase agreement. Because of these enhancements, the SPE issuances typically obtain a more favorable credit rating than the transferor could obtain for its own debt issuances. This results in less expensive financing costs than unsecured debt. The SPE may also enter into derivative contracts in order to convert the yield or currency of the underlying assets to match the needs of the SPE investors or to limit or change the credit risk of the SPE. Citigroup may be the provider of certain credit enhancements as well as the counterparty to any related derivative contracts. Most of Citigroup’s SPEs are variable interest entities (VIEs), as described below. Variable Interest Entities VIEs are entities that have either a total equity investment that is insufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or whose equity investors lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest (i.e., ability to make significant decisions through voting rights or similar rights and a right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity or an obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity). Investors that finance the VIE through debt or equity interests or other counterparties providing other forms of support, such as guarantees, certain fee arrangements or certain types of derivative contracts, are variable interest holders in the entity. The variable interest holder, if any, that has a controlling financial interest in a VIE is deemed to be the primary beneficiary and must consolidate the VIE. Citigroup would be deemed to have a controlling financial interest and be the primary beneficiary if it has both of the following characteristics: • power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance; and • an obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE, or a right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE. The Company must evaluate each VIE to understand the purpose and design of the entity, the role the Company had in the entity’s design and its involvement in the VIE’s ongoing activities. The Company then must evaluate which activities most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIE and who has the power to direct such activities. For those VIEs where the Company determines that it has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance, the Company must then evaluate its economic interests, if any, and determine whether it could absorb losses or receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. When evaluating whether the Company has an obligation to absorb losses that could potentially be significant, it considers the maximum exposure to such loss without consideration of probability. Such obligations could be in various forms, including, but not limited to, debt and equity investments, guarantees, liquidity agreements and certain derivative contracts. In various other transactions, the Company may (i) act as a derivative counterparty (for example, interest rate swap, cross-currency swap or purchaser of credit protection under a credit default swap or total return swap where the Company pays the total return on certain assets to the SPE), (ii) act as underwriter or placement agent, (iii) provide administrative, trustee or other services or (iv) make a market in debt securities or other instruments issued by VIEs. The Company generally considers such involvement, by itself, not to be variable interests and thus not an indicator of power or potentially significant benefits or losses. 230 Citigroup’s involvement with consolidated and unconsolidated VIEs with which the Company holds significant variable interests or has continuing involvement through servicing a majority of the assets in a VIE is presented below: As of December 31, 2020 Maximum exposure to loss in significant unconsolidated VIEs (1) Funded exposures (2) Unfunded exposures In millions of dollars Total involvement with SPE assets Consolidated VIE/SPE assets Significant unconsolidated VIE assets (3) Debt investments Equity investments Funding commitments Guarantees and derivatives Total Credit card securitizations $ 32,420 $ 32,420 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — Mortgage securitizations (4) U.S. agency-sponsored 123,999 — 123,999 1,948 — — 61 2,009 Non-agency-sponsored 46,132 939 45,193 2,550 — 2 1 2,553 Citi-administered asset-backed commercial paper conduits 16,730 16,730 — — — — — — Collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) 18,332 — 18,332 4,273 — — — 4,273 Asset-based financing (5) 222,274 8,069 214,205 25,153 1,587 9,114 — 35,854 Municipal securities tender option bond trusts (TOBs) 3,349 835 2,514 — — 1,611 — 1,611 Municipal investments 20,335 — 20,335 2,569 4,056 3,041 — 9,666 Client intermediation 1,352 910 442 88 — — 56 144 Investment funds 488 153 335 — — 15 — 15 Other — — — — — — — — Total $ 485,411 $ 60,056 $ 425,355 $ 36,581 $ 5,643 $ 13,783 $ 118 $ 56,125 As of December 31, 2019 Maximum exposure to loss in significant unconsolidated VIEs (1) Funded exposures (2) Unfunded exposures In millions of dollars Total involvement with SPE assets Consolidated VIE/SPE assets Significant unconsolidated VIE assets (3) Debt investments Equity investments Funding commitments Guarantees and derivatives Total Credit card securitizations $ 43,534 $ 43,534 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — Mortgage securitizations (4) U.S. agency-sponsored 117,374 — 117,374 2,671 — — 72 2,743 Non-agency-sponsored 39,608 1,187 38,421 876 — — 1 877 Citi-administered asset-backed commercial paper conduits 15,622 15,622 — — — — — — Collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) 17,395 — 17,395 4,199 — — — 4,199 Asset-based financing (5) 196,728 6,139 190,589 23,756 1,151 9,524 — 34,431 Municipal securities tender option bond trusts (TOBs) 6,950 1,458 5,492 4 — 3,544 — 3,548 Municipal investments 20,312 — 20,312 2,636 4,274 3,034 — 9,944 Client intermediation 1,455 1,391 64 4 — — — 4 Investment funds 827 174 653 5 — 16 1 22 Other 352 1 351 169 — 39 — 208 Total $ 460,157 $ 69,506 $ 390,651 $ 34,320 $ 5,425 $ 16,157 $ 74 $ 55,976 (1)    The definition of maximum exposure to loss is included in the text that follows this table. (2)    Included on Citigroup’s December 31, 2020 and 2019 Consolidated Balance Sheet. (3)    A significant unconsolidated VIE is an entity in which the Company has any variable interest or continuing involvement considered to be significant, regardless of the likelihood of loss. (4)    Citigroup mortgage securitizations also include agency and non-agency (private label) re-securitization activities. These SPEs are not consolidated. See “Re-securitizations” below for further discussion. (5)    Included within this line are loans to third-party sponsored private equity funds, which represent $ 78 billion and $ 69 billion in unconsolidated VIE assets and $ 425 million and $ 711 million in maximum exposure to loss as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 231 The previous tables do not include: • certain venture capital investments made by some of the Company’s private equity subsidiaries, as the Company accounts for these investments in accordance with the Investment Company Audit Guide (codified in ASC 946); • certain investment funds for which the Company provides investment management services and personal estate trusts for which the Company provides administrative, trustee and/or investment management services; • certain third-party sponsored private equity funds to which the Company provides secured credit facilities. The Company has no decision-making power and does not consolidate these funds, some of which may meet the definition of a VIE. The Company’s maximum exposure to loss is generally limited to a loan or lending-related commitment. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company’s maximum exposure to loss related to these deals was $ 57 billion and $ 52.5 billion, respectively (for more information on these positions, see Notes 14 and 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements); • certain VIEs structured by third parties in which the Company holds securities in inventory, as these investments are made on arm’s-length terms; • certain positions in mortgage- and asset-backed securities held by the Company, which are classified as Trading account assets or Investments , in which the Company has no other involvement with the related securitization entity deemed to be significant (for more information on these positions, see Notes 13 and 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements); • certain representations and warranties exposures in legacy ICG -sponsored mortgage- and asset-backed securitizations in which the Company has no variable interest or continuing involvement as servicer. The outstanding balance of mortgage loans securitized during 2005 to 2008 in which the Company has no variable interest or continuing involvement as servicer was approximately $ 5.22 billion and $ 6 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively; • certain representations and warranties exposures in Citigroup residential mortgage securitizations in which the original mortgage loan balances are no longer outstanding; and • VIEs such as trust preferred securities trusts used in connection with the Company’s funding activities. The Company does not have a variable interest in these trusts. The asset balances for consolidated VIEs represent the carrying amounts of the assets consolidated by the Company. The carrying amount may represent the amortized cost or the current fair value of the assets depending on the legal form of the asset (e.g., loan or security) and the Company’s standard accounting policies for the asset type and line of business. The asset balances for unconsolidated VIEs in which the Company has significant involvement represent the most current information available to the Company. In most cases, the asset balances represent an amortized cost basis without regard to impairments, unless fair value information is readily available to the Company. The maximum funded exposure represents the balance sheet carrying amount of the Company’s investment in the VIE. It reflects the initial amount of cash invested in the VIE, adjusted for any accrued interest and cash principal payments received. The carrying amount may also be adjusted for increases or declines in fair value or any impairment in value recognized in earnings. The maximum exposure of unfunded positions represents the remaining undrawn committed amount, including liquidity and credit facilities provided by the Company or the notional amount of a derivative instrument considered to be a variable interest. In certain transactions, the Company has entered into derivative instruments or other arrangements that are not considered variable interests in the VIE (e.g., interest rate swaps, cross-currency swaps or where the Company is the purchaser of credit protection under a credit default swap or total return swap where the Company pays the total return on certain assets to the SPE). Receivables under such arrangements are not included in the maximum exposure amounts. 232 Funding Commitments for Significant Unconsolidated VIEs—Liquidity Facilities and Loan Commitments The following table presents the notional amount of liquidity facilities and loan commitments that are classified as funding commitments in the VIE tables above: December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 In millions of dollars Liquidity facilities Loan/equity commitments Liquidity facilities Loan/equity commitments Non-agency-sponsored mortgage securitizations $ — $ 2 $ — $ — Asset-based financing — 9,114 — 9,524 Municipal securities tender option bond trusts (TOBs) 1,611 — 3,544 — Municipal investments — 3,041 — 3,034 Investment funds — 15 — 16 Other — — — 39 Total funding commitments $ 1,611 $ 12,172 $ 3,544 $ 12,613 Consolidated VIEs The Company engages in on-balance sheet securitizations, which are securitizations that do not qualify for sales treatment; thus, the assets remain on Citi’s Consolidated Balance Sheet, and any proceeds received are recognized as secured liabilities. The consolidated VIEs represent more than a hundred separate entities with which the Company is involved. In general, the third-party investors in the obligations of consolidated VIEs have legal recourse only to the assets of the respective VIEs and do not have such recourse to the Company, except where Citi has provided a guarantee to the investors or is the counterparty to certain derivative transactions involving the VIE. Thus, Citigroup’s maximum legal exposure to loss related to consolidated VIEs is significantly less than the carrying value of the consolidated VIE assets due to outstanding third-party financing. Intercompany assets and liabilities are excluded from Citi’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. All VIE assets are restricted from being sold or pledged as collateral. The cash flows from these assets are the only source used to pay down the associated liabilities, which are non-recourse to Citi’s general assets. See the Consolidated Balance Sheet for more information about these Consolidated VIE assets and liabilities. Significant Interests in Unconsolidated VIEs—Balance Sheet Classification The following table presents the carrying amounts and classification of significant variable interests in unconsolidated VIEs: In billions of dollars December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 Cash $ — $ — Trading account assets 2.0 2.6 Investments 10.6 9.9 Total loans, net of allowance 29.3 26.7 Other 0.3 0.5 Total assets $ 42.2 $ 39.7 233 Credit Card Securitizations The Company securitizes credit card receivables through trusts established to purchase the receivables. Citigroup transfers receivables into the trusts on a non-recourse basis. Credit card securitizations are revolving securitizations: as customers pay their credit card balances, the cash proceeds are used to purchase new receivables and replenish the receivables in the trust. Substantially all of the Company’s credit card securitization activity is through two trusts—Citibank Credit Card Master Trust (Master Trust) and Citibank Omni Master Trust (Omni Trust), with the substantial majority through the Master Trust. These trusts are consolidated entities because, as servicer, Citigroup has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the trusts. Citigroup holds a seller’s interest and certain securities issued by the trusts, which could result in exposure to potentially significant losses or benefits from the trusts. Accordingly, the transferred credit card receivables remain on Citi’s Consolidated Balance Sheet with no gain or loss recognized. The debt issued by the trusts to third parties is included on Citi’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. Citi utilizes securitizations as one of the sources of funding for its business in North America . The following table reflects amounts related to the Company’s securitized credit card receivables: In billions of dollars December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 Ownership interests in principal amount of trust credit card receivables Sold to investors via trust-issued securities $ 15.7 $ 19.7 Retained by Citigroup as trust-issued securities 7.9 6.2 Retained by Citigroup via non-certificated interests 11.1 17.8 Total $ 34.7 $ 43.7 The following table summarizes selected cash flow information related to Citigroup’s credit card securitizations: In billions of dollars 2020 2019 2018 Proceeds from new securitizations $ 0.3 $ — $ 6.8 Pay down of maturing notes ( 4.3 ) ( 7.6 ) ( 8.3 ) Managed Loans After securitization of credit card receivables, the Company continues to maintain credit card customer account relationships and provides servicing for receivables transferred to the trusts. As a result, the Company considers the securitized credit card receivables to be part of the business it manages. As Citigroup consolidates the credit card trusts, all managed securitized card receivables are on-balance sheet. Funding, Liquidity Facilities and Subordinated Interests As noted above, Citigroup securitizes credit card receivables through two securitization trusts—Master Trust and Omni Trust. The liabilities of the trusts are included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, excluding those retained by Citigroup. Master Trust Liabilities (at Par Value) The Master Trust issues fixed- and floating-rate term notes. Some of the term notes may be issued to multi-seller commercial paper conduits. The weighted average maturity of the third-party term notes issued by the Master Trust was 2.9 years as of December 31, 2020 and 3.1 years as of December 31, 2019. In billions of dollars Dec. 31, 2020 Dec. 31, 2019 Term notes issued to third parties $ 13.9 $ 18.2 Term notes retained by Citigroup affiliates 2.7 4.3 Total Master Trust liabilities $ 16.6 $ 22.5 Omni Trust Liabilities (at Par Value) The Omni Trust issues fixed- and floating-rate term notes, some of which are purchased by multi-seller commercial paper conduits. The weighted average maturity of the third-party term notes issued by the Omni Trust was 1.1 years as of December 31, 2020 and 1.6 years as of December 31, 2019. In billions of dollars Dec. 31, 2020 Dec. 31, 2019 Term notes issued to third parties $ 1.8 $ 1.5 Term notes retained by Citigroup affiliates 5.2 1.9 Total Omni Trust liabilities $ 7.0 $ 3.4 234 Mortgage Securitizations Citigroup provides a wide range of mortgage loan products to a diverse customer base. Once originated, the Company often securitizes these loans through the use of VIEs. These VIEs are funded through the issuance of trust certificates backed solely by the transferred assets. These certificates have the same life as the transferred assets. In addition to providing a source of liquidity and less expensive funding, securitizing these assets also reduces Citi’s credit exposure to the borrowers. These mortgage loan securitizations are primarily non-recourse, thereby effectively transferring the risk of future credit losses to the purchasers of the securities issued by the trust. Citi’s U.S. consumer mortgage business generally retains the servicing rights and in certain instances retains investment securities, interest-only strips and residual interests in future cash flows from the trusts and also provides servicing for a limited number of ICG securitizations. Citi’s ICG business may hold investment securities pursuant to credit risk retention rules or in connection with secondary market-making activities. The Company securitizes mortgage loans generally through either a U.S. government-sponsored agency, such as Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac (U.S. agency-sponsored mortgages), or private label (non-agency-sponsored mortgages) securitization. Citi is not the primary beneficiary of its U.S. agency-sponsored mortgage securitization entities because Citigroup does not have the power to direct the activities of the VIEs that most significantly impact the entities’ economic performance. Therefore, Citi does not consolidate these U.S. agency-sponsored mortgage securitization entities. Substantially all of the consumer loans sold or securitized through non-consolidated trusts by Citigroup are U.S. prime residential mortgage loans. Retained interests in non-consolidated agency-sponsored mortgage securitization trusts are classified as Trading account assets , except for MSRs, which are included in Other assets on Citigroup’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. Citigroup does not consolidate certain non-agency-sponsored mortgage securitization entities because Citi is either not the servicer with the power to direct the significant activities of the entity or Citi is the servicer, but the servicing relationship is deemed to be a fiduciary relationship; therefore, Citi is not deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the entity. In certain instances, the Company has (i) the power to direct the activities and (ii) the obligation to either absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could be potentially significant to its non-agency-sponsored mortgage securitization entities and, therefore, is the primary beneficiary and, thus, consolidates the VIE. The following tables summarize selected cash flow information and retained interests related to Citigroup mortgage securitizations: 2020 2019 2018 In billions of dollars U.S. agency- sponsored mortgages Non-agency- sponsored mortgages U.S. agency- sponsored mortgages Non-agency- sponsored mortgages U.S. agency- sponsored mortgages Non-agency- sponsored mortgages Principal securitized $ 9.4 $ 11.3 $ 5.3 $ 15.6 $ 4.0 $ 5.6 Proceeds from new securitizations (1) 10.0 11.4 5.5 15.5 4.2 7.1 Contractual servicing fees received 0.1 — 0.1 — 0.1 — Purchases of previously transferred financial assets 0.4 — 0.2 — 0.2 — Note: Excludes re-securitization transactions. (1)    The proceeds from new securitizations in 2019 include $ 0.2 billion related to personal loan securitizations. For non-consolidated mortgage securitization entities where the transfer of loans to the VIE meets the conditions for sale accounting, Citi recognizes a gain or loss based on the difference between the carrying value of the transferred assets and the proceeds received (generally cash but may be beneficial interests or servicing rights). Agency and non-agency securitization gains for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $ 88.4 million and $ 139.4 million, respectively. Agency and non-agency securitization gains for the year ended December 31, 2019 were $ 16 million and $ 73.4 million, respectively, and $ 17 million and $ 36 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2018. 2020 2019 Non-agency-sponsored mortgages (1) Non-agency-sponsored mortgages (1) In millions of dollars U.S. agency- sponsored mortgages Senior interests (2) Subordinated interests U.S. agency- sponsored mortgages Senior interests Subordinated interests Carrying value of retained interests (3) $ 315 $ 1,210 $ 145 $ 491 $ 748 $ 102 (1)    Disclosure of non-agency-sponsored mortgages as senior and subordinated interests is indicative of the interests’ position in the capital structure of the securitization. (2)    Senior interests in non-agency-sponsored mortgages include $ 112 million related to personal loan securitizations at December 31, 2020. (3)    Retained interests consist of Level 2 or Level 3 assets depending on the observability of significant inputs. See Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about fair value measurements. 235 Key assumptions used in measuring the fair value of retained interests at the date of sale or securitization of mortgage receivables were as follows: December 31, 2020 Non-agency-sponsored mortgages (1) U.S. agency- sponsored mortgages Senior interests Subordinated interests Weighted average discount rate 5.4 % 1.7 % 3.0 % Weighted average constant prepayment rate 25.8 % 3.4 % 25.0 % Weighted average anticipated net credit losses (2) NM 1.7 % 0.5 % Weighted average life 4.8 years 3.8 years 2.3 years December 31, 2019 Non-agency-sponsored mortgages (1) U.S. agency- sponsored mortgages Senior interests Subordinated interests Weighted average discount rate 9.3 % 3.6 % 4.6 % Weighted average constant prepayment rate 12.9 % 10.5 % 7.6 % Weighted average anticipated net credit losses (2) NM 3.9 % 2.8 % Weighted average life 6.6 years 3.0 years 11.4 years (1)    Disclosure of non-agency-sponsored mortgages as senior and subordinated interests is indicative of the interests’ position in the capital structure of the securitization. (2)    Anticipated net credit losses represent estimated loss severity associated with defaulted mortgage loans underlying the mortgage securitizations disclosed above. Anticipated net credit losses, in this instance, do not represent total credit losses incurred to date, nor do they represent credit losses expected on retained interests in mortgage securitizations. NM   Anticipated net credit losses are not meaningful due to U.S. agency guarantees. The interests retained by the Company range from highly rated and/or senior in the capital structure to unrated and/or residual interests. Key assumptions used in measuring the fair value of retained interests in securitizations of mortgage receivables at period end were as follows: December 31, 2020 Non-agency-sponsored mortgages (1) U.S. agency- sponsored mortgages Senior interests Subordinated interests Weighted average discount rate 5.9 % 7.2 % 4.3 % Weighted average constant prepayment rate 22.7 % 5.3 % 4.7 % Weighted average anticipated net credit losses (2) NM 1.2 % 1.4 % Weighted average life 4.5 years 5.3 years 4.7 years December 31, 2019 Non-agency-sponsored mortgages (1) U.S. agency- sponsored mortgages Senior interests Subordinated interests Weighted average discount rate 9.8 % 7.6 % 4.2 % Weighted average constant prepayment rate 10.1 % 3.6 % 6.1 % Weighted average anticipated net credit losses (2) NM 5.2 % 2.7 % Weighted average life 6.6 years 5.9 years 29.3 years (1)    Disclosure of non-agency-sponsored mortgages as senior and subordinated interests is indicative of the interests’ position in the capital structure of the securitization.

NM    Anticipated net credit losses are not meaningful due to U.S. agency guarantees. 236 The sensitivity of the fair value to adverse changes of 10% and 20% in each of the key assumptions is presented in the tables below. The negative effect of each change is calculated independently, holding all other assumptions constant. Because the key assumptions may not be independent, the net effect of simultaneous adverse changes in the key assumptions may be less than the sum of the individual effects shown below.

Failure to service the loans in accordance with contractual requirements may lead to a termination of the servicing rights and the loss of future servicing fees. These transactions create intangible assets referred to as MSRs, which are recorded at fair value on Citi’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. The fair value of Citi’s capitalized MSRs was $ 336 million and $ 495 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The MSRs correspond to principal loan balances of $ 53 billion and $ 58 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The following table summarizes the changes in capitalized MSRs: In millions of dollars 2020 2019 Balance, beginning of year $ 495 $ 584 Originations 123 70 Changes in fair value of MSRs due to changes in inputs and assumptions ( 204 ) ( 84 ) Other changes (1) ( 78 ) ( 75 ) Sale of MSRs — — Balance, as of December 31 $ 336 $ 495 (1)    Represents changes due to customer payments and passage of time. The fair value of the MSRs is primarily affected by changes in prepayments of mortgages that result from shifts in mortgage interest rates. Specifically, higher interest rates tend to lead to declining prepayments, which causes the fair value of the MSRs to increase. In managing this risk, Citigroup economically hedges a significant portion of the value of its MSRs through the use of interest rate derivative contracts, forward purchase and sale commitments of mortgage-backed securities and purchased securities, all classified as Trading account assets . The Company receives fees during the course of servicing previously securitized mortgages. The amounts of these fees were as follows: In millions of dollars 2020 2019 2018 Servicing fees $ 142 $ 148 $ 172 Late fees 5 8 4 Ancillary fees — 1 8 Total MSR fees $ 147 $ 157 $ 184 In the Consolidated Statement of Income these fees are primarily classified as Commissions and fees , and changes in MSR fair values are classified as Other revenue . Re-securitizations The Company engages in re-securitization transactions in which debt securities are transferred to a VIE in exchange for new beneficial interests. Citi did not transfer non-agency (private label) securities to re-securitization entities during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. These securities are backed by either residential or commercial mortgages and are often structured on behalf of clients. As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, Citi held no retained interests in private label re-securitization transactions structured by Citi. The Company also re-securitizes U.S. government-agency guaranteed mortgage-backed (agency) securities. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, Citi transferred agency securities with a fair value of approximately $ 42.8 billion and $ 31.9 billion, respectively, to re-securitization entities. As of December 31, 2020, the fair value of Citi-retained interests in agency re-securitization transactions structured by Citi totaled approximately $ 1.6 billion (including $ 916 million related to re-securitization transactions executed in 2020) compared to $ 2.2 billion as of December 31, 2019 (including $ 1.3 billion related to re-securitization transactions executed in 2019), which is recorded in Trading account assets . The original fair value of agency re-securitization transactions in which Citi holds a retained interest as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 was approximately $ 83.6 billion and $ 73.5 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company did not consolidate any private label or agency re-securitization entities. Citi-Administered Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Conduits The Company is active in the asset-backed commercial paper conduit business as administrator of several multi-seller commercial paper conduits and also as a service provider to single-seller and other commercial paper conduits sponsored by third parties. Citi’s multi-seller commercial paper conduits are designed to provide the Company’s clients access to low-cost funding in the commercial paper markets. The conduits purchase assets from or provide financing facilities to clients and are funded by issuing commercial paper to third-party investors. The conduits generally do not purchase assets originated by Citi. The funding of the conduits is facilitated by the liquidity support and credit enhancements provided by the Company. As administrator to Citi’s conduits, the Company is generally responsible for selecting and structuring assets purchased or financed by the conduits, making decisions regarding the funding of the conduits, including determining the tenor and other features of the commercial paper issued, monitoring the quality and performance of the conduits’ assets and facilitating the operations and cash flows of the conduits. In return, the Company earns structuring fees from customers for individual transactions and earns an administration fee from the conduit, which is equal to the income from the client program and liquidity fees of the conduit after payment of conduit expenses. This administration fee is fairly stable, since most risks and rewards of the underlying assets are passed back to the clients. Once the asset pricing is negotiated, most ongoing income, costs and fees are relatively stable as a percentage of the conduit’s size. The conduits administered by Citi do not generally invest in liquid securities that are formally rated by third parties. The assets are privately negotiated and structured transactions that 238 are generally designed to be held by the conduit, rather than actively traded and sold. The yield earned by the conduit on each asset is generally tied to the rate on the commercial paper issued by the conduit, thus passing interest rate risk to the client. Each asset purchased by the conduit is structured with transaction-specific credit enhancement features provided by the third-party client seller, including over-collateralization, cash and excess spread collateral accounts, direct recourse or third-party guarantees. These credit enhancements are sized with the objective of approximating a credit rating of A or above, based on Citi’s internal risk ratings. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the commercial paper conduits administered by Citi had approximately $ 16.7 billion and $ 15.6 billion of purchased assets outstanding, respectively, and had incremental funding commitments with clients of approximately $ 17.1 billion and $ 16.3 billion, respectively. Substantially all of the funding of the conduits is in the form of short-term commercial paper. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the weighted average remaining lives of the commercial paper issued by the conduits were approximately 54 and 49 days, respectively. The primary credit enhancement provided to the conduit investors is in the form of transaction-specific credit enhancements described above. In addition to the transaction-specific credit enhancements, the conduits, other than the government guaranteed loan conduit, have obtained a letter of credit from the Company, which is equal to at least 8 % to 10 % of the conduit’s assets with a minimum of $ 200 million. The letters of credit provided by the Company to the conduits total approximately $ 1.5 billion as of December 31, 2020 and $ 1.4 billion as of December 31, 2019. The net result across multi-seller conduits administered by the Company is that, in the event that defaulted assets exceed the transaction-specific credit enhancements described above, any losses in each conduit are allocated first to the Company and then to the commercial paper investors. Citigroup also provides the conduits with two forms of liquidity agreements that are used to provide funding to the conduits in the event of a market disruption, among other events. Each asset of the conduits is supported by a transaction-specific liquidity facility in the form of an asset purchase agreement (APA). Under the APA, the Company has generally agreed to purchase non-defaulted eligible receivables from the conduit at par. The APA is not designed to provide credit support to the conduit, as it generally does not permit the purchase of defaulted or impaired assets. Any funding under the APA will likely subject the underlying conduit clients to increased interest costs. In addition, the Company provides the conduits with program-wide liquidity in the form of short-term lending commitments. Under these commitments, the Company has agreed to lend to the conduits in the event of a short-term disruption in the commercial paper market, subject to specified conditions. The Company receives fees for providing both types of liquidity agreements and considers these fees to be on fair market terms. Finally, Citi is one of several named dealers in the commercial paper issued by the conduits and earns a market-based fee for providing such services. Along with third-party dealers, the Company makes a market in the commercial paper and may from time to time fund commercial paper pending sale to a third party. On specific dates with less liquidity in the market, the Company may hold in inventory commercial paper issued by conduits administered by the Company, as well as conduits administered by third parties. Separately, in the normal course of business, Citi purchases commercial paper, including commercial paper issued by Citigroup's conduits. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company owned $ 6.6 billion and $ 5.5 billion, respectively, of the commercial paper issued by its administered conduits. The Company’s investments were not driven by market illiquidity and the Company is not obligated under any agreement to purchase the commercial paper issued by the conduits. The asset-backed commercial paper conduits are consolidated by Citi. The Company has determined that, through its roles as administrator and liquidity provider, it has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entities’ economic performance. These powers include its ability to structure and approve the assets purchased by the conduits, its ongoing surveillance and credit mitigation activities, its ability to sell or repurchase assets out of the conduits and its liability management. In addition, as a result of all the Company’s involvement described above, it was concluded that Citi has an economic interest that could potentially be significant. However, the assets and liabilities of the conduits are separate and apart from those of Citigroup. No assets of any conduit are available to satisfy the creditors of Citigroup or any of its other subsidiaries. Collateralized Loan Obligations (CLOs) A collateralized loan obligation (CLO) is a VIE that purchases a portfolio of assets consisting primarily of non-investment grade corporate loans. CLOs issue multiple tranches of debt and equity to investors to fund the asset purchases and pay upfront expenses associated with forming the CLO. A third-party asset manager is contracted by the CLO to purchase the underlying assets from the open market and monitor the credit risk associated with those assets. Over the term of a CLO, the asset manager directs purchases and sales of assets in a manner consistent with the CLO’s asset management agreement and indenture. In general, the CLO asset manager will have the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the economic performance of the CLO. Investors in a CLO, through their ownership of debt and/or equity in it, can also direct certain activities of the CLO, including removing its asset manager under limited circumstances, optionally redeeming the notes, voting on amendments to the CLO’s operating documents and other activities. A CLO has a finite life, typically 12 years. Citi serves as a structuring and placement agent with respect to the CLOs. Typically, the debt and equity of the CLOs are sold to third-party investors. On occasion, certain Citi entities may purchase some portion of a CLO’s liabilities for investment purposes. In addition, Citi may purchase, typically in the secondary market, certain securities issued by the CLOs to support its market making activities. The Company generally does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the CLOs, as this power is generally held by a third-party asset manager of the CLO. As such, those CLOs are not consolidated. 239 The following tables summarize selected cash flow information and retained interests related to Citigroup CLOs: In billions of dollars 2020 2019 2018 Principal securitized $ 0.1 $ — $ — Proceeds from new securitizations 0.1 — — Cash flows received on retained interests and other net cash flows — — 0.1 In millions of dollars Dec. 31, 2020 Dec. 31, 2019 Dec. 31, 2018 Carrying value of retained interests $ 1,611 $ 1,404 $ 3,142 All of Citi’s retained interests were held-to-maturity securities as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. Asset-Based Financing The Company provides loans and other forms of financing to VIEs that hold assets. Those loans are subject to the same credit approvals as all other loans originated or purchased by the Company. Financings in the form of debt securities or derivatives are, in most circumstances, reported in Trading account assets and accounted for at fair value through earnings. The Company generally does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact these VIEs’ economic performance; thus, it does not consolidate them. The primary types of Citi’s asset-based financings, total assets of the unconsolidated VIEs with significant involvement and Citi’s maximum exposure to loss are shown below. For Citi to realize the maximum loss, the VIE (borrower) would have to default with no recovery from the assets held by the VIE.

TOB trusts are typically structured as single-issuer entities whose assets are purchased from either the Company or from other investors in the municipal securities market. TOB trusts finance the purchase of their municipal assets by issuing two classes of certificates: long-dated, floating rate certificates (“Floaters”) that are putable pursuant to a liquidity facility and residual interest certificates (“Residuals”). The Floaters are purchased by third-party investors, typically tax-exempt money market funds. The Residuals are purchased by the original owner of the municipal securities that are being financed. From Citigroup’s perspective, there are two types of TOB trusts: customer and non-customer. Customer TOB trusts are those trusts utilized by customers of the Company to finance their securities, generally municipal securities. The Residuals issued by these trusts are purchased by the customer being financed. Non-customer TOB trusts are generally used by the Company to finance its own municipal securities investments; the Residuals issued by non-customer TOB trusts are purchased by the Company. With respect to both customer and non-customer TOB trusts, Citi may provide remarketing agent services. If Floaters are optionally tendered and the Company, in its role as remarketing agent, is unable to find a new investor to purchase the optionally tendered Floaters within a specified period of time, Citigroup may, but is not obligated to, purchase the tendered Floaters into its own inventory. The level of the Company’s inventory of such Floaters fluctuates. For certain customer TOB trusts, Citi may also serve as a voluntary advance provider. In this capacity, the Company may, but is not obligated to, make loan advances to customer TOB trusts to purchase optionally tendered Floaters that have not otherwise been successfully remarketed to new investors. Such loans are secured by pledged Floaters. As of December 31, 2020, Citi had no outstanding voluntary advances to customer TOB trusts. For certain non-customer trusts, the Company also provides credit enhancement. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, none of the municipal bonds owned by non-customer TOB trusts were subject to a credit guarantee provided by the Company. Citigroup also provides liquidity services to many customer and non-customer trusts. If a trust is unwound early due to an event other than a credit event on the underlying municipal bonds, the underlying municipal bonds are sold out of the trust and bond sale proceeds are used to redeem the outstanding trust certificates. If this results in a shortfall between the bond sale proceeds and the redemption price of the tendered Floaters, the Company, pursuant to the liquidity agreement, would be obligated to make a payment to the trust to satisfy that shortfall. For certain customer TOB trusts, Citigroup has also executed a reimbursement agreement with the holder of the Residual, pursuant to which the Residual holder is obligated to reimburse the Company for any payment the Company makes under the liquidity arrangement. These reimbursement agreements may be subject to daily margining based on changes in the market value of the underlying 240 municipal bonds. In cases where a third party provides liquidity to a non-customer TOB trust, a similar reimbursement arrangement may be executed, whereby the Company (or a consolidated subsidiary of the Company), as Residual holder, would absorb any losses incurred by the liquidity provider. For certain other non-customer TOB trusts, Citi serves as tender option provider. The tender option provider arrangement allows Floater holders to put their interests directly to the Company at any time, subject to the requisite notice period requirements, at a price of par. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, liquidity agreements provided with respect to customer TOB trusts totaled $ 1.6 billion and $ 3.5 billion, respectively, of which $ 0.8 billion and $ 1.6 billion, respectively, were offset by reimbursement agreements. For the remaining exposure related to TOB transactions, where the residual owned by the customer was at least 25 % of the bond value at the inception of the transaction, no reimbursement agreement was executed. Citi considers both customer and non-customer TOB trusts to be VIEs. Customer TOB trusts are not consolidated by the Company, as the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the trust’s economic performance rests with the customer Residual holder, which may unilaterally cause the sale of the trust’s bonds. Non-customer TOB trusts generally are consolidated because the Company holds the Residual interest and thus has the unilateral power to cause the sale of the trust’s bonds. The Company also provides other liquidity agreements or letters of credit to customer-sponsored municipal investment funds, which are not variable interest entities, and municipality-related issuers that totaled $ 3.6 billion as of December 31, 2020 and $ 7.0 billion as of December 31, 2019. These liquidity agreements and letters of credit are offset by reimbursement agreements with various term-out provisions. Municipal Investments Municipal investment transactions include debt and equity interests in partnerships that finance the construction and rehabilitation of low-income housing, facilitate lending in new or underserved markets or finance the construction or operation of renewable municipal energy facilities. Citi generally invests in these partnerships as a limited partner and earns a return primarily through the receipt of tax credits and grants earned from the investments made by the partnership. The Company may also provide construction loans or permanent loans for the development or operation of real estate properties held by partnerships. These entities are generally considered VIEs. The power to direct the activities of these entities is typically held by the general partner. Accordingly, these entities are not consolidated by Citigroup. Client Intermediation Client intermediation transactions represent a range of transactions designed to provide investors with specified returns based on the returns of an underlying security, referenced asset or index. These transactions include credit-linked notes and equity-linked notes. In these transactions, the VIE typically obtains exposure to the underlying security, referenced asset or index through a derivative instrument, such as a total-return swap or a credit-default swap. In turn, the VIE issues notes to investors that pay a return based on the specified underlying security, referenced asset or index. The VIE invests the proceeds in a financial asset or a guaranteed insurance contract that serves as collateral for the derivative contract over the term of the transaction. The Company’s involvement in these transactions includes being the counterparty to the VIE’s derivative instruments and investing in a portion of the notes issued by the VIE. In certain transactions, the investor’s maximum risk of loss is limited and the Company absorbs risk of loss above a specified level. Citi does not have the power to direct the activities of the VIEs that most significantly impact their economic performance and thus it does not consolidate them. Citi’s maximum risk of loss in these transactions is defined as the amount invested in notes issued by the VIE and the notional amount of any risk of loss absorbed by Citi through a separate instrument issued by the VIE. The derivative instrument held by the Company may generate a receivable from the VIE (for example, where the Company purchases credit protection from the VIE in connection with the VIE’s issuance of a credit-linked note), which is collateralized by the assets owned by the VIE. These derivative instruments are not considered variable interests and any associated receivables are not included in the calculation of maximum exposure to the VIE. Investment Funds The Company is the investment manager for certain investment funds and retirement funds that invest in various asset classes including private equity, hedge funds, real estate, fixed income and infrastructure. Citigroup earns a management fee, which is a percentage of capital under management, and may earn performance fees. In addition, for some of these funds the Company has an ownership interest in the investment funds. Citi has also established a number of investment funds as opportunities for qualified colleagues to invest in private equity investments. The Company acts as investment manager for these funds and may provide colleagues with financing on both recourse and non-recourse bases for a portion of the colleagues’ investment commitments. 241 22. DERIVATIVES In the ordinary course of business, Citigroup enters into various types of derivative transactions, which include: • Futures and forward contracts , which are commitments to buy or sell at a future date a financial instrument, commodity or currency at a contracted price that may be settled in cash or through delivery of an item readily convertible to cash. • Swap contracts , which are commitments to settle in cash at a future date or dates that may range from a few days to a number of years, based on differentials between specified indices or financial instruments, as applied to a notional principal amount. • Option contracts , which give the purchaser, for a premium, the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell within a specified time a financial instrument, commodity or currency at a contracted price that may also be settled in cash, based on differentials between specified indices or prices. Swaps, forwards and some option contracts are over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives that are bilaterally negotiated with counterparties and settled with those counterparties, except for swap contracts that are novated and "cleared" through central counterparties (CCPs). Futures contracts and other option contracts are standardized contracts that are traded on an exchange with a CCP as the counterparty from the inception of the transaction. Citigroup enters into derivative contracts relating to interest rate, foreign currency, commodity and other market/credit risks for the following reasons: • Trading Purposes : Citigroup trades derivatives as an active market maker. Citigroup offers its customers derivatives in connection with their risk management actions to transfer, modify or reduce their interest rate, foreign exchange and other market/credit risks or for their own trading purposes. Citigroup also manages its derivative risk positions through offsetting trade activities, controls focused on price verification and daily reporting of positions to senior managers. • Hedging : Citigroup uses derivatives in connection with its own risk management activities to hedge certain risks or reposition the risk profile of the Company. Hedging may be accomplished by applying hedge accounting in accordance with ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging , or by an economic hedge. For example, Citigroup issues fixed-rate long-term debt and then enters into a receive-fixed, pay-variable-rate interest rate swap with the same tenor and notional amount to synthetically convert the interest payments to a net variable-rate basis. This strategy is the most common form of an interest rate hedge, as it minimizes net interest cost in certain yield curve environments. Derivatives are also used to manage market risks inherent in specific groups of on-balance sheet assets and liabilities, including AFS securities, commodities and borrowings, as well as other interest-sensitive assets and liabilities. In addition, foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge non-U.S.-dollar- denominated debt, foreign currency-denominated AFS securities and net investment exposures. Derivatives may expose Citigroup to market, credit or liquidity risks in excess of the amounts recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Market risk on a derivative product is the exposure created by potential fluctuations in interest rates, market prices, foreign exchange rates and other factors and is a function of the type of product, the volume of transactions, the tenor and terms of the agreement and the underlying volatility. Credit risk is the exposure to loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to satisfy a derivative liability where the value of any collateral held by Citi is not adequate to cover such losses. The recognition in earnings of unrealized gains on derivative transactions is subject to management’s assessment of the probability of counterparty default. Liquidity risk is the potential exposure that arises when the size of a derivative position may affect the ability to monetize the position in a reasonable period of time and at a reasonable cost in periods of high volatility and financial stress. Derivative transactions are customarily documented under industry standard master netting agreements, which provide that following an event of default, the non-defaulting party may promptly terminate all transactions between the parties and determine the net amount due to be paid to, or by, the defaulting party. Events of default include (i) failure to make a payment on a derivative transaction that remains uncured following applicable notice and grace periods, (ii) breach of agreement that remains uncured after applicable notice and grace periods, (iii) breach of a representation, (iv) cross default, either to third-party debt or to other derivative transactions entered into between the parties, or, in some cases, their affiliates, (v) the occurrence of a merger or consolidation that results in a party’s becoming a materially weaker credit and (vi) the cessation or repudiation of any applicable guarantee or other credit support document. Obligations under master netting agreements are often secured by collateral posted under an industry standard credit support annex to the master netting agreement. An event of default may also occur under a credit support annex if a party fails to make a collateral delivery that remains uncured following applicable notice and grace periods. The netting and collateral rights incorporated in the master netting agreements are considered to be legally enforceable if a supportive legal opinion has been obtained from counsel of recognized standing that provides (i) the requisite level of certainty regarding enforceability and (ii) that the exercise of rights by the non-defaulting party to terminate and close-out transactions on a net basis under these agreements will not be stayed or avoided under applicable law upon an event of default, including bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceeding. A legal opinion may not be sought for certain jurisdictions where local law is silent or unclear as to the enforceability of such rights or where adverse case law or conflicting regulation may cast doubt on the enforceability of such rights. In some jurisdictions and for some counterparty types, the insolvency law may not provide the requisite level of certainty. For 242 example, this may be the case for certain sovereigns, municipalities, central banks and U.S. pension plans. Exposure to credit risk on derivatives is affected by market volatility, which may impair the ability of counterparties to satisfy their obligations to the Company. Credit limits are established and closely monitored for customers engaged in derivatives transactions. Citi considers the level of legal certainty regarding enforceability of its offsetting rights under master netting agreements and credit support annexes to be an important factor in its risk management process. Specifically, Citi generally transacts much lower volumes of derivatives under master netting agreements where Citi does not have the requisite level of legal certainty regarding enforceability, because such derivatives consume greater amounts of single counterparty credit limits than those executed under enforceable master netting agreements. Cash collateral and security collateral in the form of G10 government debt securities are often posted by a party to a master netting agreement to secure the net open exposure of the other party; the receiving party is free to commingle/rehypothecate such collateral in the ordinary course of its business. Nonstandard collateral such as corporate bonds, municipal bonds, U.S. agency securities and/or MBS may also be pledged as collateral for derivative transactions. Security collateral posted to open and maintain a master netting agreement with a counterparty, in the form of cash and/or securities, may from time to time be segregated in an account at a third-party custodian pursuant to a tri-party account control agreement. As of January 1, 2018, Citigroup early adopted ASU 2017-12, Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities . This standard primarily impacts Citi’s accounting for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges and fair value hedges. Refer to the respective sections below for details. 243 Information pertaining to Citigroup’s derivative activities, based on notional amounts, is presented in the table below. Derivative notional amounts are reference amounts from which contractual payments are derived and do not represent a complete measure of Citi’s exposure to derivative transactions. Citi’s derivative exposure arises primarily from market fluctuations (i.e., market risk), counterparty failure (i.e., credit risk) and/or periods of high volatility or financial stress (i.e., liquidity risk), as well as any market valuation adjustments that may be required on the transactions. Moreover, notional amounts do not reflect the netting of offsetting trades. For example, if Citi enters into a receive-fixed interest rate swap with $100 million notional, and offsets this risk with an identical but opposite pay-fixed position with a different counterparty, $200 million in derivative notionals is reported, although these offsetting positions may result in de minimis overall market risk. In addition, aggregate derivative notional amounts can fluctuate from period to period in the normal course of business based on Citi’s market share, levels of client activity and other factors. All derivatives are recorded in Trading account assets/Trading account liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

These arrangements allow a protection seller to assume the credit risk associated with the reference asset without directly purchasing that asset. The Company enters into credit derivative positions for purposes such as risk management, yield enhancement, reduction of credit concentrations and diversification of overall risk. 244 The following tables present the gross and net fair values of the Company’s derivative transactions and the related offsetting amounts as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. Gross positive fair values are offset against gross negative fair values by counterparty, pursuant to enforceable master netting agreements. Under ASC 815-10-45, payables and receivables in respect of cash collateral received from or paid to a given counterparty pursuant to a credit support annex are included in the offsetting amount if a legal opinion supporting the enforceability of netting and collateral rights has been obtained. GAAP does not permit similar offsetting for security collateral. In addition, the following tables reflect rule changes adopted by clearing organizations that require or allow entities to treat certain derivative assets, liabilities and the related variation margin as settlement of the related derivative fair values for legal and accounting purposes, as opposed to presenting gross derivative assets and liabilities that are subject to collateral, whereby the counterparties would also record a related collateral payable or receivable. As a result, the tables reflect a reduction of approximately $ 280 billion and $ 180 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, of derivative assets and derivative liabilities that previously would have been reported on a gross basis, but are now legally settled and not subject to collateral. The tables also present amounts that are not permitted to be offset, such as security collateral or cash collateral posted at third-party custodians, but which would be eligible for offsetting to the extent that an event of default has occurred and a legal opinion supporting enforceability of the netting and collateral rights has been obtained. 245 Derivative Mark-to-Market (MTM) Receivables/Payables In millions of dollars at December 31, 2020 Derivatives classified in Trading account assets/liabilities (1)(2) Derivatives instruments designated as ASC 815 hedges Assets Liabilities Over-the-counter $ 1,781 $ 161 Cleared 74 319 Interest rate contracts $ 1,855 $ 480 Over-the-counter $ 2,037 $ 2,042 Foreign exchange contracts $ 2,037 $ 2,042 Total derivatives instruments designated as ASC 815 hedges $ 3,892 $ 2,522 Derivatives instruments not designated as ASC 815 hedges Over-the-counter $ 228,519 $ 209,330 Cleared 11,041 12,563 Exchange traded 46 38 Interest rate contracts $ 239,606 $ 221,931 Over-the-counter $ 153,791 $ 152,784 Cleared 842 1,239 Exchange traded — 1 Foreign exchange contracts $ 154,633 $ 154,024 Over-the-counter $ 29,244 $ 41,036 Cleared 1 18 Exchange traded 21,274 22,515 Equity contracts $ 50,519 $ 63,569 Over-the-counter $ 13,659 $ 17,076 Exchange traded 879 1,017 Commodity and other contracts $ 14,538 $ 18,093 Over-the-counter $ 7,826 $ 7,951 Cleared 1,963 2,178 Credit derivatives $ 9,789 $ 10,129 Total derivatives instruments not designated as ASC 815 hedges $ 469,085 $ 467,746 Total derivatives $ 472,977 $ 470,268 Cash collateral paid/received (3) $ 32,778 $ 8,196 Less: Netting agreements (4) ( 364,879 ) ( 364,879 ) Less: Netting cash collateral received/paid (5) ( 63,915 ) ( 45,628 ) Net receivables/payables included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet (6) $ 76,961 $ 67,957 Additional amounts subject to an enforceable master netting agreement, but not offset on the Consolidated Balance Sheet Less: Cash collateral received/paid $ ( 1,567 ) $ ( 473 ) Less: Non-cash collateral received/paid ( 7,408 ) ( 13,087 ) Total net receivables/payables (6) $ 67,986 $ 54,397 (1) The derivatives fair values are also presented in Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (2) Over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives are derivatives executed and settled bilaterally with counterparties without the use of an organized exchange or central clearing house. Cleared derivatives include derivatives executed bilaterally with a counterparty in the OTC market, but then novated to a central clearing house, whereby the central clearing house becomes the counterparty to both of the original counterparties. Exchange-traded derivatives include derivatives executed directly on an organized exchange that provides pre-trade price transparency. (3) Reflects the net amount of the $ 78,406 million and $ 72,111 million of gross cash collateral paid and received, respectively. Of the gross cash collateral paid, $ 45,628 million was used to offset trading derivative liabilities. Of the gross cash collateral received, $ 63,915 million was used to offset trading derivative assets. (4) Represents the netting of balances with the same counterparty under enforceable netting agreements. Approximately $ 336 billion, $ 9 billion and $ 20 billion of the netting against trading account asset/liability balances is attributable to each of the OTC, cleared and exchange-traded derivatives, respectively.

Citigroup presents this disclosure by business classification, showing derivative gains and losses related to its trading activities together with gains and losses related to non-derivative instruments within the same trading portfolios, as this represents how these portfolios are risk managed. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. The amounts recognized in Other revenue in the Consolidated Statement of Income related to derivatives not designated in a qualifying hedging relationship are shown below. The table below does not include any offsetting gains (losses) on the economically hedged items to the extent that such amounts are also recorded in Other revenue . Gains (losses) included in Other revenue Year ended December 31, In millions of dollars 2020 2019 2018 Interest rate contracts $ 63 $ 57 $ ( 25 ) Foreign exchange ( 57 ) ( 29 ) ( 197 ) Total $ 6 $ 28 $ ( 222 ) Accounting for Derivative Hedging Citigroup accounts for its hedging activities in accordance with ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging . As a general rule, hedge accounting is permitted where the Company is exposed to a particular risk, such as interest rate or foreign exchange risk, that causes changes in the fair value of an asset or liability or variability in the expected future cash flows of an existing asset, liability or a forecasted transaction that may affect earnings. Derivative contracts hedging the risks associated with changes in fair value are referred to as fair value hedges, while contracts hedging the variability of expected future cash flows are cash flow hedges. Hedges that utilize derivatives or debt instruments to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with equity investments in non-U.S.-dollar-functional-currency foreign subsidiaries (net investment in a foreign operation) are net investment hedges. To qualify as an accounting hedge under the hedge accounting rules (versus an economic hedge where hedge accounting is not applied), a hedging relationship must be highly effective in offsetting the risk designated as being hedged. The hedging relationship must be formally documented at inception, detailing the particular risk management objective and strategy for the hedge. This includes the item and risk(s) being hedged, the hedging instrument being used and how effectiveness will be assessed. The effectiveness of these hedging relationships is evaluated at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis both on a retrospective and prospective basis, typically using quantitative measures of correlation, with hedge ineffectiveness measured and recorded in current earnings. Hedge effectiveness assessment methodologies are performed in a similar manner for similar hedges, and are used consistently throughout the hedging relationships. The assessment of effectiveness may exclude changes in the value of the hedged item that are unrelated to the risks being hedged and the changes in fair value of the derivative associated with time value. Prior to January 1, 2018, these excluded items were recognized in current earnings for the hedging derivative, while changes in the value of a hedged item that were not related to the hedged risk were not recorded. Upon adoption of ASC 2017-12, Citi excludes changes in the cross-currency basis associated with cross-currency swaps from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and records it in Other comprehensive income . Discontinued Hedge Accounting A hedging instrument must be highly effective in accomplishing the hedge objective of offsetting either changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item for the risk being hedged. Management may voluntarily de-designate an accounting hedge at any time, but if a hedging relationship is not highly effective, it no longer qualifies for hedge accounting and must be de-designated. Subsequent changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognized in Other revenue or Principal transactions , similar to trading derivatives, with no offset recorded related to the hedged item. For fair value hedges, any changes in the fair value of the hedged item remain as part of the basis of the asset or liability and are ultimately realized as an element of the yield on the item. For cash flow hedges, changes in fair value of the end-user derivative remain in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI) and are included in the earnings of future periods when the forecasted hedged cash flows impact earnings. However, if it becomes probable that some or all of the hedged forecasted transactions will not occur, any amounts that remain in AOCI related to these transactions must be immediately reflected in Other revenue . The foregoing criteria are applied on a decentralized basis, consistent with the level at which market risk is managed, but are subject to various limits and controls. The underlying asset, liability or forecasted transaction may be an individual item or a portfolio of similar items. 248 Fair Value Hedges Hedging of Benchmark Interest Rate Risk Citigroup’s fair value hedges are primarily hedges of fixed-rate long-term debt or assets, such as available-for-sale debt securities or loans. For qualifying fair value hedges of interest rate risk, the changes in the fair value of the derivative and the change in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are presented within Interest revenue or Interest expense based on whether the hedged item is an asset or a liability. Citigroup has executed a last-of-layer hedge, which permits an entity to hedge the interest rate risk of a stated portion of a closed portfolio of prepayable financial assets that are expected to remain outstanding for the designated tenor of the hedge. In accordance with ASC 815, an entity may exclude prepayment risk when measuring the change in fair value of the hedged item attributable to interest rate risk under the last-of-layer approach. Similar to other fair value hedges, where the hedged item is an asset, the fair value of the hedged item attributable to interest rate risk will be presented in Interest revenue along with the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument. Hedging of Foreign Exchange Risk Citigroup hedges the change in fair value attributable to foreign exchange rate movements in available-for-sale debt securities and long-term debt that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity holding the securities or issuing the debt. The hedging instrument is generally a forward foreign exchange contract or a cross-currency swap contract. Citigroup considers the premium associated with forward contracts (i.e., the differential between the spot and contractual forward rates) as the cost of hedging; this amount is excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and is generally reflected directly in earnings over the life of the hedge. Citi also excludes changes in cross-currency basis associated with cross-currency swaps from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and records it in Other comprehensive income. Hedging of Commodity Price Risk Citigroup hedges the change in fair value attributable to spot price movements in physical commodities inventories. The hedging instrument is a futures contract to sell the underlying commodity. In this hedge, the change in the value of the hedged inventory is reflected in earnings, which offsets the change in the fair value of the futures contract that is also reflected in earnings. Although the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument recorded in earnings includes changes in forward rates, Citigroup excludes the differential between the spot and the contractual forward rates under the futures contract from the assessment of hedge effectiveness, and it is generally reflected directly in earnings over the life of the hedge. Citi also excludes changes in forward rates from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and records it in Other comprehensive income . 249 The following table summarizes the gains (losses) on the Company’s fair value hedges: Gains (losses) on fair value hedges (1) Year ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 In millions of dollars Other revenue Net interest revenue Other revenue Net interest revenue Other revenue Net interest revenue Gain (loss) on the hedging derivatives included in assessment of the effectiveness of fair value hedges Interest rate hedges $ — $ 4,189 $ — $ 2,273 $ — $ 794 Foreign exchange hedges 1,442 — 337 — ( 2,064 ) — Commodity hedges ( 164 ) — ( 33 ) — ( 123 ) — Total gain (loss) on the hedging derivatives included in assessment of the effectiveness of fair value hedges $ 1,278 $ 4,189 $ 304 $ 2,273 $ ( 2,187 ) $ 794 Gain (loss) on the hedged item in designated and qualifying fair value hedges Interest rate hedges $ — $ ( 4,537 ) $ — $ ( 2,085 ) $ — $ ( 747 ) Foreign exchange hedges ( 1,442 ) — ( 337 ) — 2,064 — Commodity hedges 164 — 33 — 124 — Total gain (loss) on the hedged item in designated and qualifying fair value hedges $ ( 1,278 ) $ ( 4,537 ) $ ( 304 ) $ ( 2,085 ) $ 2,188 $ ( 747 ) Net gain (loss) on the hedging derivatives excluded from assessment of the effectiveness of fair value hedges Interest rate hedges $ — $ ( 23 ) $ — $ 3 $ — $ ( 5 ) Foreign exchange hedges (2) ( 73 ) — ( 109 ) — ( 4 ) — Commodity hedges 131 — 41 — ( 19 ) — Total net gain (loss) on the hedging derivatives excluded from assessment of the effectiveness of fair value hedges $ 58 $ ( 23 ) $ ( 68 ) $ 3 $ ( 23 ) $ ( 5 ) (1) Gain (loss) amounts for interest rate risk hedges are included in Interest income/Interest expense. The accrued interest income on fair value hedges is recorded in Net interest revenue and is excluded from this table. (2) Amounts relate to the premium associated with forward contracts (differential between spot and contractual forward rates) that are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are generally reflected directly in earnings. Amounts related to cross-currency basis, which are recognized in AOCI , are not reflected in the table above. The amount of cross-currency basis that was included in AOCI was $( 23 ) million and $ 33 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 250 Cumulative Basis Adjustment Upon electing to apply ASC 815 fair value hedge accounting, the carrying value of the hedged item is adjusted to reflect the cumulative changes in the hedged risk. This cumulative hedge basis adjustment becomes part of the carrying value of the hedged item until the hedged item is derecognized from the balance sheet. The table below presents the carrying amount of Citi’s hedged assets and liabilities under qualifying fair value hedges at December 31, 2020 and 2019, along with the cumulative hedge basis adjustments included in the carrying value of those hedged assets and liabilities, that would reverse through earnings in future periods.

The Company designated approximately $ 2,527 million as the hedged amount (from a closed portfolio of prepayable financial assets with a carrying value of $ 19 billion as of December 31, 2020) in a last-of-layer hedging relationship. (2)    These amounts include a cumulative basis adjustment of $( 8 ) million for active hedges and $ 157 million for de-designated hedges as of December 31, 2019 related to certain prepayable financial assets designated as the hedged item in a fair value hedge using the last-of-layer approach. The Company designated approximately $ 605 million as the hedged amount (from a closed portfolio of prepayable financial assets with a carrying value of $ 20 billion as of December 31, 2019) in a last-of-layer hedging relationship. (3)    Carrying amount represents the amortized cost. 251 Cash Flow Hedges Citigroup hedges the variability of forecasted cash flows due to changes in contractually specified interest rates associated with floating-rate assets/liabilities and other forecasted transactions. Variable cash flows from those liabilities are synthetically converted to fixed-rate cash flows by entering into receive-variable, pay-fixed interest rate swaps and receive-variable, pay-fixed forward-starting interest rate swaps. Variable cash flows associated with certain assets are synthetically converted to fixed-rate cash flows by entering into receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps. These cash flow hedging relationships use either regression analysis or dollar-offset ratio analysis to assess whether the hedging relationships are highly effective at inception and on an ongoing basis. Prior to the adoption of ASU 2017-12, Citigroup designated the risk being hedged as the risk of overall variability in the hedged cash flows for certain items. With the adoption of ASU 2017-12, Citigroup hedges the variability from changes in a contractually specified rate and recognizes the entire change in fair value of the cash flow hedging instruments in AOCI . Prior to the adoption of ASU 2017-12, to the extent that these derivatives were not fully effective, changes in their fair values in excess of changes in the value of the hedged transactions were immediately included in Other revenue . With the adoption of ASU 2017-12, such amounts are no longer required to be immediately recognized in income, but instead the full change in the value of the hedging instrument is required to be recognized in AOCI , and then recognized in earnings in the same period that the cash flows impact earnings. The pretax change in AOCI from cash flow hedges is presented below: In millions of dollars 2020 2019 2018 Amount of gain (loss) recognized in AOCI on derivatives Interest rate contracts $ 2,670 $ 746 $ ( 361 ) Foreign exchange contracts ( 15 ) ( 17 ) 5 Total gain (loss) recognized in AOCI $ 2,655 $ 729 $ ( 356 ) Amount of gain (loss) reclassified from AOCI to earnings (1) Other revenue Net interest revenue Other revenue Net interest revenue Other revenue Net interest revenue Interest rate contracts $ — $ 734 $ — $ ( 384 ) $ — $ ( 301 ) Foreign exchange contracts ( 4 ) — ( 7 ) — ( 17 ) — Total gain (loss) reclassified from AOCI into earnings $ ( 4 ) $ 734 $ ( 7 ) $ ( 384 ) $ ( 17 ) $ ( 301 ) Net pretax change in cash flow hedges included within AOCI $ 1,925 $ 1,120 $ ( 38 ) (1) All amounts reclassified into earnings for interest rate contracts are included in Interest income/Interest expense (Net interest revenue) . For all other hedges, the amounts reclassified to earnings are included primarily in Other revenue and Net interest revenue in the Consolidated Statement of Income. For cash flow hedges, the entire change in the fair value of the hedging derivative is recognized in AOCI and then reclassified to earnings in the same period that the forecasted hedged cash flows impact earnings. The net gain (loss) associated with cash flow hedges expected to be reclassified from AOCI within 12 months of December 31, 2020 is approximately $ 920 million. The maximum length of time over which forecasted cash flows are hedged is 10 years. The after-tax impact of cash flow hedges on AOCI is shown in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 252 Net Investment Hedges Consistent with ASC 830-20, Foreign Currency Matters—Foreign Currency Transactions , ASC 815 allows the hedging of the foreign currency risk of a net investment in a foreign operation. Citigroup uses foreign currency forwards, cross-currency swaps, options and foreign currency-denominated debt instruments to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with Citigroup’s equity investments in several non-U.S.-dollar-functional-currency foreign subsidiaries. Citigroup records the change in the carrying amount of these investments in Foreign currency translation adjustment within AOCI . Simultaneously, the effective portion of the hedge of this exposure is also recorded in Foreign currency translation adjustment and any ineffective portion is immediately recorded in earnings. For derivatives designated as net investment hedges, Citigroup follows the forward-rate method outlined in ASC 815-35-35. According to that method, all changes in fair value, including changes related to the forward-rate component of the foreign currency forward contracts and the time value of foreign currency options, are recorded in Foreign currency translation adjustment within AOCI . For foreign currency-denominated debt instruments that are designated as hedges of net investments, the translation gain or loss that is recorded in Foreign currency translation adjustment is based on the spot exchange rate between the functional currency of the respective subsidiary and the U.S. dollar, which is the functional currency of Citigroup. To the extent that the notional amount of the hedging instrument exactly matches the hedged net investment, and the underlying exchange rate of the derivative hedging instrument relates to the exchange rate between the functional currency of the net investment and Citigroup’s functional currency (or, in the case of a non-derivative debt instrument, such instrument is denominated in the functional currency of the net investment), no ineffectiveness is recorded in earnings. The pretax gain (loss) recorded in Foreign currency translation adjustment within AOCI , related to net investment hedges, was $( 600 ) million, $( 569 ) million and $ 1,147 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Economic Hedges Citigroup often uses economic hedges when hedge accounting would be too complex or operationally burdensome. End-user derivatives that are economic hedges are carried at fair value, with changes in value included in either Principal transactions or Other revenue . For asset/liability management hedging, fixed-rate long-term debt is recorded at amortized cost under GAAP. For other hedges that either do not meet the ASC 815 hedging criteria or for which management decides not to apply ASC 815 hedge accounting, the derivative is recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with the associated changes in fair value recorded in earnings, while the debt continues to be carried at amortized cost. Therefore, current earnings are affected by the interest rate shifts and other factors that cause a change in the swap’s value, but for which no offsetting change in value is recorded on the debt. Citigroup may alternatively elect to account for the debt at fair value under the fair value option. Once the irrevocable election is made upon issuance of the debt, the full change in fair value of the debt is reported in earnings. The changes in fair value of the related interest rate swap are also reflected in earnings, which provides a natural offset to the debt’s fair value change. To the extent that the two amounts differ because the full change in the fair value of the debt includes risks not offset by the interest rate swap, the difference is automatically captured in current earnings. Additional economic hedges include hedges of the credit risk component of commercial loans and loan commitments. Citigroup periodically evaluates its hedging strategies in other areas and may designate either an accounting hedge or an economic hedge after considering the relative costs and benefits. Economic hedges are also employed when the hedged item itself is marked to market through current earnings, such as hedges of commitments to originate one- to four-family mortgage loans to be HFS and MSRs. Credit Derivatives Citi is a market maker and trades a range of credit derivatives. Through these contracts, Citi either purchases or writes protection on either a single name or a portfolio of reference credits. Citi also uses credit derivatives to help mitigate credit risk in its corporate and consumer loan portfolios and other cash positions and to facilitate client transactions. Citi monitors its counterparty credit risk in credit derivative contracts. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, approximately 97 % and 98 %, respectively, of the gross receivables are from counterparties with which Citi maintains collateral agreements. A majority of Citi’s top 15 counterparties (by receivable balance owed to Citi) are central clearing houses, banks, financial institutions or other dealers. Contracts with these counterparties do not include ratings-based termination events. However, counterparty ratings downgrades may have an incremental effect by lowering the threshold at which Citi may call for additional collateral. The range of credit derivatives entered into includes credit default swaps, total return swaps, credit options and credit-linked notes. A credit default swap is a contract in which, for a fee, a protection seller agrees to reimburse a protection buyer for any losses that occur due to a predefined credit event on a reference entity. These credit events are defined by the terms of the derivative contract and the reference credit and are generally limited to the market standard of failure to pay on indebtedness and bankruptcy of the reference credit and, in a more limited range of transactions, debt restructuring. Credit derivative transactions that reference emerging market entities also typically include additional credit events to cover the acceleration of indebtedness and the risk of repudiation or a payment moratorium. In certain transactions, protection may be provided on a portfolio of reference entities or asset-backed securities. If there is no credit event, as defined by the specific derivative contract, then the protection seller makes no payments to the protection buyer and receives only the contractually specified fee. However, if a credit event occurs as defined in the specific derivative contract sold, the protection seller will be required to make a payment to the 253 protection buyer. Under certain contracts, the seller of protection may not be required to make a payment until a specified amount of losses has occurred with respect to the portfolio and/or may only be required to pay for losses up to a specified amount. A total return swap typically transfers the total economic performance of a reference asset, which includes all associated cash flows, as well as capital appreciation or depreciation. The protection buyer receives a floating rate of interest and any depreciation on the reference asset from the protection seller and, in return, the protection seller receives the cash flows associated with the reference asset plus any appreciation. Thus, according to the total return swap agreement, the protection seller will be obligated to make a payment any time the floating interest rate payment plus any depreciation of the reference asset exceeds the cash flows associated with the underlying asset. A total return swap may terminate upon a default of the reference asset or a credit event with respect to the reference entity, subject to the provisions of the related total return swap agreement between the protection seller and the protection buyer. A credit option is a credit derivative that allows investors to trade or hedge changes in the credit quality of a reference entity. For example, in a credit spread option, the option writer assumes the obligation to purchase or sell credit protection on the reference entity at a specified “strike” spread level. The option purchaser buys the right to sell credit default protection on the reference entity to, or purchase it from, the option writer at the strike spread level. The payments on credit spread options depend either on a particular credit spread or the price of the underlying credit-sensitive asset or other reference entity. The options usually terminate if a credit event occurs with respect to the underlying reference entity. A credit-linked note is a form of credit derivative structured as a debt security with an embedded credit default swap. The purchaser of the note effectively provides credit protection to the issuer by agreeing to receive a return that could be negatively affected by credit events on the underlying reference credit. If the reference entity defaults, the note may be cash settled or physically settled by delivery of a debt security of the reference entity. Thus, the maximum amount of the note purchaser’s exposure is the amount paid for the credit-linked note. 254 The following tables summarize the key characteristics of Citi’s credit derivatives portfolio by counterparty and derivative form: Fair values Notionals In millions of dollars at December 31, 2020 Receivable (1) Payable (2) Protection purchased Protection sold By industry of counterparty Banks $ 2,902 $ 3,187 $ 117,685 $ 120,739 Broker-dealers 1,770 1,215 46,928 44,692 Non-financial 109 90 5,740 2,217 Insurance and other financial institutions 5,008 5,637 442,417 375,959 Total by industry of counterparty $ 9,789 $ 10,129 $ 612,770 $ 543,607 By instrument Credit default swaps and options $ 9,254 $ 9,254 $ 599,633 $ 538,426 Total return swaps and other 535 875 13,137 5,181 Total by instrument $ 9,789 $ 10,129 $ 612,770 $ 543,607 By rating of reference entity Investment grade $ 4,136 $ 4,037 $ 478,643 $ 418,147 Non-investment grade 5,653 6,092 134,127 125,460 Total by rating of reference entity $ 9,789 $ 10,129 $ 612,770 $ 543,607 By maturity Within 1 year $ 914 $ 1,355 $ 134,080 $ 125,464 From 1 to 5 years 6,022 5,991 421,682 374,376 After 5 years 2,853 2,783 57,008 43,767 Total by maturity $ 9,789 $ 10,129 $ 612,770 $ 543,607 (1) The fair value amount receivable is composed of $ 3,514 million under protection purchased and $ 6,275 million under protection sold.

(2) The fair value amount payable is composed of $ 7,793 million under protection purchased and $ 2,945 million under protection sold. 255 Fair values included in the above tables are prior to application of any netting agreements and cash collateral. For notional amounts, Citi generally has a mismatch between the total notional amounts of protection purchased and sold, and it may hold the reference assets directly rather than entering into offsetting credit derivative contracts as and when desired. The open risk exposures from credit derivative contracts are largely matched after certain cash positions in reference assets are considered and after notional amounts are adjusted, either to a duration-based equivalent basis or to reflect the level of subordination in tranched structures. The ratings of the credit derivatives portfolio presented in the tables and used to evaluate payment/performance risk are based on the assigned internal or external ratings of the reference asset or entity. Where external ratings are used, investment-grade ratings are considered to be “Baa/BBB” and above, while anything below is considered non-investment grade. Citi’s internal ratings are in line with the related external rating system. Citigroup evaluates the payment/performance risk of the credit derivatives for which it stands as a protection seller based on the credit rating assigned to the underlying reference credit. Credit derivatives written on an underlying non-investment grade reference credit represent greater payment risk to the Company. The non-investment grade category in the table above also includes credit derivatives where the underlying reference entity has been downgraded subsequent to the inception of the derivative. The maximum potential amount of future payments under credit derivative contracts presented in the table above is based on the notional value of the derivatives. The Company believes that the notional amount for credit protection sold is not representative of the actual loss exposure based on historical experience. This amount has not been reduced by the value of the reference assets and the related cash flows. In accordance with most credit derivative contracts, should a credit event occur, the Company usually is liable for the difference between the protection sold and the value of the reference assets. Furthermore, the notional amount for credit protection sold has not been reduced for any cash collateral paid to a given counterparty, as such payments would be calculated after netting all derivative exposures, including any credit derivatives with that counterparty in accordance with a related master netting agreement. Due to such netting processes, determining the amount of collateral that corresponds to credit derivative exposures alone is not possible. The Company actively monitors open credit-risk exposures and manages this exposure by using a variety of strategies, including purchased credit derivatives, cash collateral or direct holdings of the referenced assets. This risk mitigation activity is not captured in the table above. Credit Risk-Related Contingent Features in Derivatives Certain derivative instruments contain provisions that require the Company to either post additional collateral or immediately settle any outstanding liability balances upon the occurrence of a specified event related to the credit risk of the Company. These events, which are defined by the existing derivative contracts, are primarily downgrades in the credit ratings of the Company and its affiliates. The fair value (excluding CVA) of all derivative instruments with credit risk-related contingent features that were in a net liability position at both December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $ 25 billion and $ 30 billion, respectively. The Company posted $ 22 billion and $ 28 billion as collateral for this exposure in the normal course of business as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. A downgrade could trigger additional collateral or cash settlement requirements for the Company and certain affiliates. In the event that Citigroup and Citibank were downgraded a single notch by all three major rating agencies as of December 31, 2020, the Company could be required to post an additional $ 0.8 billion as either collateral or settlement of the derivative transactions. In addition, the Company could be required to segregate with third-party custodians collateral previously received from existing derivative counterparties in the amount of $ 0.2 billion upon the single notch downgrade, resulting in aggregate cash obligations and collateral requirements of approximately $ 1 billion. Derivatives Accompanied by Financial Asset Transfers The Company executes total return swaps that provide it with synthetic exposure to substantially all of the economic return of the securities or other financial assets referenced in the contract. In certain cases, the derivative transaction is accompanied by the Company’s transfer of the referenced financial asset to the derivative counterparty, most typically in response to the derivative counterparty’s desire to hedge, in whole or in part, its synthetic exposure under the derivative contract by holding the referenced asset in funded form. In certain jurisdictions these transactions qualify as sales, resulting in derecognition of the securities transferred (see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the related sale conditions for transfers of financial assets). For a significant portion of the transactions, the Company has also executed another total return swap where the Company passes on substantially all of the economic return of the referenced securities to a different third party seeking the exposure. In those cases, the Company is not exposed, on a net basis, to changes in the economic return of the referenced securities. These transactions generally involve the transfer of the Company’s liquid government bonds, convertible bonds or publicly traded corporate equity securities from the trading portfolio and are executed with third-party financial institutions. The accompanying derivatives are typically total return swaps. The derivatives are cash settled and subject to ongoing margin requirements. When the conditions for sale accounting are met, the Company reports the transfer of the referenced financial asset as a sale and separately reports the accompanying derivative transaction. These transactions generally do not result in a gain 256 or loss on the sale of the security, because the transferred security was held at fair value in the Company’s trading portfolio. For transfers of financial assets accounted for as a sale by the Company and for which the Company has retained substantially all of the economic exposure to the transferred asset through a total return swap executed with the same counterparty in contemplation of the initial sale (and still outstanding), both the asset amounts derecognized and the gross cash proceeds received as of the date of derecognition were $ 2.0 billion and $ 5.8 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. At December 31, 2020, the fair value of these previously derecognized assets was $ 2.2 billion. The fair value of the total return swaps as of December 31, 2020 was $ 135 million recorded as gross derivative assets and $ 7 million recorded as gross derivative liabilities. At December 31, 2019, the fair value of these previously derecognized assets was $ 5.9 billion, and the fair value of the total return swaps was $ 117 million recorded as gross derivative assets and $ 43 million recorded as gross derivative liabilities. The balances for the total return swaps are on a gross basis, before the application of counterparty and cash collateral netting, and are included primarily as equity derivatives in the tabular disclosures in this Note. 257 23. CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK Concentrations of credit risk exist when changes in economic, industry or geographic factors similarly affect groups of counterparties whose aggregate credit exposure is material in relation to Citigroup’s total credit exposure. Although Citigroup’s portfolio of financial instruments is broadly diversified along industry, product and geographic lines, material transactions are completed with other financial institutions, particularly in the securities trading, derivatives and foreign exchange businesses. In connection with the Company’s efforts to maintain a diversified portfolio, the Company limits its exposure to any one geographic region, country or individual creditor and monitors this exposure on a continuous basis. At December 31, 2020, Citigroup’s most significant concentration of credit risk was with the U.S. government and its agencies. The Company’s exposure, which primarily results from trading assets and investments issued by the U.S. government and its agencies, amounted to $ 370.1 billion and $ 250.9 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The German and Japanese governments and their agencies, which are rated investment grade by both Moody’s and S&P, were the next largest exposures. The Company’s exposure to Germany amounted to $ 51.8 billion and $ 29.8 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and was composed of investment securities, loans and trading assets. The Company’s exposure to Japan amounted to $ 35.5 billion and $ 33.3 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and was composed of investment securities, loans and trading assets. The Company’s exposure to states and municipalities amounted to $ 24.4 billion and $ 31.4 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and was composed of trading assets, investment securities, derivatives and lending activities. 258 24. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT ASC 820-10, Fair Value Measurement , defines fair value, establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value and requires disclosures about fair value measurements. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, and therefore represents an exit price. Among other things, the standard requires the Company to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Under ASC 820-10, the probability of default of a counterparty is factored into the valuation of derivative and other positions as well as the impact of Citigroup’s own credit risk on derivatives and other liabilities measured at fair value. Fair Value Hierarchy ASC 820-10 specifies a hierarchy of inputs based on whether the inputs are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs are developed using market data and reflect market participant assumptions, while unobservable inputs reflect the Company’s market assumptions. These two types of inputs have created the following fair value hierarchy: • Level 1: Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. • Level 2: Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets. • Level 3: Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable . As required under the fair value hierarchy, the Company considers relevant and observable market inputs in its valuations where possible. The frequency of transactions, the size of the bid-ask spread and the amount of adjustment necessary when comparing similar transactions are all factors in determining the relevance of observed prices in those markets. Determination of Fair Value For assets and liabilities carried at fair value, the Company measures fair value using the procedures set out below, irrespective of whether the assets and liabilities are measured at fair value as a result of an election or whether they are required to be measured at fair value. When available, the Company uses quoted market prices from active markets to determine fair value and classifies such items as Level 1. In some specific cases where a market price is available, the Company will make use of acceptable practical expedients (such as matrix pricing) to calculate fair value, in which case the items are classified as Level 2. The Company may also apply a price-based methodology, which utilizes, where available, quoted prices or other market information obtained from recent trading activity in positions with the same or similar characteristics to the position being valued. The frequency and size of transactions are among the factors that are driven by the liquidity of markets and determine the relevance of observed prices in those markets. If relevant and observable prices are available, those valuations may be classified as Level 2. When that is not the case, and there are one or more significant unobservable “price” inputs, then those valuations will be classified as Level 3. Furthermore, when a quoted price is stale, a significant adjustment to the price of a similar security is necessary to reflect differences in the terms of the actual security or loan being valued, or prices from independent sources are insufficient to corroborate the valuation, the “price” inputs are considered unobservable and the fair value measurements are classified as Level 3. If quoted market prices are not available, fair value is based upon internally developed valuation techniques that use, where possible, current market-based parameters, such as interest rates, currency rates and option volatilities. Items valued using such internally generated valuation techniques are classified according to the lowest level input or value driver that is significant to the valuation. Thus, an item may be classified as Level 3 even though there may be some significant inputs that are readily observable. Fair value estimates from internal valuation techniques are verified, where possible, to prices obtained from independent vendors or brokers. Vendors’ and brokers’ valuations may be based on a variety of inputs ranging from observed prices to proprietary valuation models, and the Company assesses the quality and relevance of this information in determining the estimate of fair value. The following section describes the valuation methodologies used by the Company to measure various financial instruments at fair value, including an indication of the level in the fair value hierarchy in which each instrument is generally classified. Where appropriate, the description includes details of the valuation models, the key inputs to those models and any significant assumptions. Market Valuation Adjustments Generally, the unit of account for a financial instrument is the individual financial instrument. The Company applies market valuation adjustments that are consistent with the unit of account, which does not include adjustment due to the size of the Company’s position, except as follows. ASC 820-10 permits an exception, through an accounting policy election, to measure the fair value of a portfolio of financial assets and financial liabilities on the basis of the net open risk position when certain criteria are met. Citi has elected to measure certain portfolios of financial instruments that meet those criteria, such as derivatives, on the basis of the net open risk position. The Company applies market valuation adjustments, including adjustments to account for the size of the net open risk position, consistent with market participant assumptions. Valuation adjustments are applied to items classified as Level 2 or Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy to ensure that the fair value reflects the price at which the net open risk position could be exited. These valuation adjustments are based on the bid/offer spread for an instrument in the market. When Citi has elected to measure certain portfolios of financial investments, such as derivatives, on the basis of the net open 259 risk position, the valuation adjustment may take into account the size of the position. Credit valuation adjustments (CVA) and funding valuation adjustments (FVA) are applied to the relevant population of over-the-counter (OTC) derivative instruments where adjustments to reflect counterparty credit risk, own credit risk and term funding risk are required to estimate fair value. This principally includes derivatives with a base valuation (e.g., discounted using overnight indexed swap (OIS)) requiring adjustment for these effects, such as uncollateralized interest rate swaps. The CVA represents a portfolio-level adjustment to reflect the risk premium associated with the counterparty’s (assets) or Citi’s (liabilities) non-performance risk. The FVA represents a market funding risk premium inherent in the uncollateralized portion of a derivative portfolio and in certain collateralized derivative portfolios that do not include standard credit support annexes (CSAs), such as where the CSA does not permit the reuse of collateral received. Citi’s FVA methodology leverages the existing CVA methodology to estimate a funding exposure profile. The calculation of this exposure profile considers collateral agreements in which the terms do not permit the Company to reuse the collateral received, including where counterparties post collateral to third-party custodians. Citi’s CVA and FVA methodology consists of two steps: • First, the exposure profile for each counterparty is determined using the terms of all individual derivative positions and a Monte Carlo simulation or other quantitative analysis to generate a series of expected cash flows at future points in time. The calculation of this exposure profile considers the effect of credit risk mitigants and sources of funding, including pledged cash or other collateral and any legal right of offset that exists with a counterparty through arrangements such as netting agreements. Individual derivative contracts that are subject to an enforceable master netting agreement with a counterparty are aggregated as a netting set for this purpose, since it is those aggregate net cash flows that are subject to nonperformance risk. This process identifies specific, point-in-time future cash flows that are subject to nonperformance risk and unsecured funding, rather than using the current recognized net asset or liability as a basis to measure the CVA and FVA. • Second, for CVA, market-based views of default probabilities derived from observed credit spreads in the credit default swap (CDS) market are applied to the expected future cash flows determined in step one. Citi’s own-credit CVA is determined using Citi-specific CDS spreads for the relevant tenor. Generally, counterparty CVA is determined using CDS spread indices for each credit rating and tenor. For certain identified netting sets where individual analysis is practicable (e.g., exposures to counterparties with liquid CDSs), counterparty-specific CDS spreads are used. For FVA, a term structure of future liquidity spreads is applied to the expected future funding requirement. The CVA and FVA are designed to incorporate a market view of the credit and funding risk, respectively, inherent in the derivative portfolio. However, most unsecured derivative instruments are negotiated bilateral contracts and are not commonly transferred to third parties. Derivative instruments are normally settled contractually or, if terminated early, are terminated at a value negotiated bilaterally between the counterparties. Thus, the CVA and FVA may not be realized upon a settlement or termination in the normal course of business. In addition, all or a portion of these adjustments may be reversed or otherwise adjusted in future periods in the event of changes in the credit or funding risk associated with the derivative instruments. The table below summarizes the CVA and FVA applied to the fair value of derivative instruments at December 31, 2020 and 2019: Credit and funding valuation adjustments contra-liability (contra-asset) In millions of dollars December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 Counterparty CVA $ ( 800 ) $ ( 705 ) Asset FVA ( 525 ) ( 530 ) Citigroup (own-credit) CVA 403 341 Liability FVA 67 72 Total CVA—derivative instruments (1) $ ( 855 ) $ ( 822 ) (1)     FVA is included with CVA for presentation purposes.

(2)    FVA is included with CVA for presentation purposes. Securities Purchased Under Agreements to Resell and Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase No quoted prices exist for these instruments, so fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow technique. Cash flows are estimated based on the terms of the contract, taking into account any embedded derivative or other features. These cash flows are discounted using interest rates appropriate to the maturity of the instrument as well as the nature of the 260 underlying collateral. Generally, when such instruments are recorded at fair value, they are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, as the inputs used in the valuation are readily observable. However, certain long-dated positions are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Trading Account Assets and Liabilities—Trading Securities and Trading Loans When available, the Company uses quoted market prices in active markets to determine the fair value of trading securities; such items are classified as Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Examples include government securities and exchange-traded equity securities. For bonds and secondary market loans traded over the counter, the Company generally determines fair value utilizing valuation techniques, including discounted cash flows, price-based and internal models. Fair value estimates from these internal valuation techniques are verified, where possible, to prices obtained from independent sources, including third-party vendors. Vendors compile prices from various sources and may apply matrix pricing for similar bonds or loans where no price is observable. A price-based methodology utilizes, where available, quoted prices or other market information obtained from recent trading activity of assets with similar characteristics to the bond or loan being valued. The yields used in discounted cash flow models are derived from the same price information. Trading securities and loans priced using such methods are generally classified as Level 2. However, when a quoted price is stale, a significant adjustment to the price of a similar security or loan is necessary to reflect differences in the terms of the actual security or loan being valued, or prices from independent sources are insufficient to corroborate valuation, a loan or security is generally classified as Level 3. The price input used in a price-based methodology may be zero for a security, such as a subprime collateralized debt obligation (CDO), that is not receiving any principal or interest and is not expected to receive any in the future. When the Company’s principal exit market for a portfolio of loans is through securitization, the Company uses the securitization price as a key input into the fair value of the loan portfolio. The securitization price is determined from the assumed proceeds of a hypothetical securitization within the current market environment, with adjustments made to account for various costs associated with the process of securitization. Where such a price verification is possible, loan portfolios are typically classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. For most of the subprime mortgage backed security (MBS) exposures, fair value is determined utilizing observable transactions where available, or other valuation techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis utilizing valuation assumptions derived from similar, more observable securities as market proxies. The valuation of certain asset-backed security (ABS) CDO positions are inferred through the net asset value of the underlying assets of the ABS CDO. Trading Account Assets and Liabilities—Derivatives Exchange-traded derivatives, measured at fair value using quoted (i.e., exchange) prices in active markets, where available, are classified as Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Derivatives without a quoted price in an active market and derivatives executed over the counter are valued using internal valuation techniques. These derivative instruments are classified as either Level 2 or Level 3 depending on the observability of the significant inputs to the model. The valuation techniques depend on the type of derivative and the nature of the underlying instrument. The principal techniques used to value these instruments are discounted cash flows and internal models, such as derivative pricing models (e.g., Black-Scholes and Monte Carlo simulations). The key inputs depend upon the type of derivative and the nature of the underlying instrument and include interest rate yield curves, foreign exchange rates, volatilities and correlation. The Company typically uses OIS curves as fair value measurement inputs for the valuation of certain derivatives. Investments The investments category includes available-for-sale debt and marketable equity securities whose fair values are generally determined by utilizing similar procedures described for trading securities above or, in some cases, using vendor pricing as the primary source. Also included in investments are nonpublic investments in private equity and real estate entities. Determining the fair value of nonpublic securities involves a significant degree of management judgment, as no quoted prices exist and such securities do not generally trade. In addition, there may be transfer restrictions on private equity securities. The Company’s process for determining the fair value of such securities utilizes commonly accepted valuation techniques, including guideline public company analysis and comparable transactions. In determining the fair value of nonpublic securities, the Company also considers events such as a proposed sale of the investee company, initial public offerings, equity issuances or other observable transactions. Private equity securities are generally classified as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. In addition, the Company holds investments in certain alternative investment funds that calculate NAV per share, including hedge funds, private equity funds and real estate funds. Investments in funds are generally classified as non-marketable equity securities carried at fair value. The fair values of these investments are estimated using the NAV per share of the Company’s ownership interest in the funds where it is not probable that the investment will be realized at a price other than the NAV. Consistent with the provisions of ASU 2015-07, these investments have not been categorized within the fair value hierarchy and are not included in the tables below. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 261 Short-Term Borrowings and Long-Term Debt Where fair value accounting has been elected, the fair value of non-structured liabilities is determined by utilizing internal models using the appropriate discount rate for the applicable maturity. Such instruments are generally classified as Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy when all significant inputs are readily observable. The Company determines the fair value of hybrid financial instruments, including structured liabilities, using the appropriate derivative valuation methodology (described above in “Trading Account Assets and Liabilities—Derivatives”) given the nature of the embedded risk profile. Such instruments are classified as Level 2 or Level 3 depending on the observability of significant inputs to the model. 262 Items Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis The following tables present for each of the fair value hierarchy levels the Company’s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2020 and 2019. The Company may hedge positions that have been classified in the Level 3 category with other financial instruments (hedging instruments) that may be classified as Level 3, but also with financial instruments classified as Level 1 or Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The effects of these hedges are presented gross in the following tables: Fair Value Levels In millions of dollars at December 31, 2020 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Gross inventory Netting (1) Net balance Assets Securities borrowed and purchased under agreements to resell $ — $ 335,073 $ 320 $ 335,393 $ ( 150,189 ) $ 185,204 Trading non-derivative assets Trading mortgage-backed securities U.S. government-sponsored agency guaranteed — 42,903 27 42,930 — 42,930 Residential — 391 340 731 — 731 Commercial — 893 136 1,029 — 1,029 Total trading mortgage-backed securities $ — $ 44,187 $ 503 $ 44,690 $ — $ 44,690 U.S. Treasury and federal agency securities $ 64,529 $ 2,269 $ — $ 66,798 $ — $ 66,798 State and municipal — 1,224 94 1,318 — 1,318 Foreign government 68,195 15,143 51 83,389 — 83,389 Corporate 1,607 18,840 375 20,822 — 20,822 Equity securities 54,117 12,289 73 66,479 — 66,479 Asset-backed securities — 776 1,606 2,382 — 2,382 Other trading assets (2) — 11,295 945 12,240 — 12,240 Total trading non-derivative assets $ 188,448 $ 106,023 $ 3,647 $ 298,118 $ — $ 298,118 Trading derivatives Interest rate contracts $ 42 $ 238,026 $ 3,393 $ 241,461 Foreign exchange contracts 2 155,994 674 156,670 Equity contracts 66 48,362 2,091 50,519 Commodity contracts — 13,546 992 14,538 Credit derivatives — 8,634 1,155 9,789 Total trading derivatives $ 110 $ 464,562 $ 8,305 $ 472,977 Cash collateral paid (3) $ 32,778 Netting agreements $ ( 364,879 ) Netting of cash collateral received ( 63,915 ) Total trading derivatives $ 110 $ 464,562 $ 8,305 $ 505,755 $ ( 428,794 ) $ 76,961 Investments Mortgage-backed securities U.S. government-sponsored agency guaranteed $ — $ 43,888 $ 30 $ 43,918 $ — $ 43,918 Residential — 571 — 571 — 571 Commercial — 50 — 50 — 50 Total investment mortgage-backed securities $ — $ 44,509 $ 30 $ 44,539 $ — $ 44,539 U.S. Treasury and federal agency securities $ 146,032 $ 172 $ — $ 146,204 $ — $ 146,204 State and municipal — 2,885 834 3,719 — 3,719 Foreign government 77,056 47,644 268 124,968 — 124,968 Corporate 6,326 4,114 60 10,500 — 10,500 Marketable equity securities 287 228 — 515 — 515 Asset-backed securities — 277 1 278 — 278 Other debt securities — 4,876 — 4,876 — 4,876 Non-marketable equity securities (4) — 50 349 399 — 399 Total investments $ 229,701 $ 104,755 $ 1,542 $ 335,998 $ — $ 335,998 Table continues on the next page. 263 In millions of dollars at December 31, 2020 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Gross inventory Netting (1) Net balance Loans $ — $ 4,869 $ 1,985 $ 6,854 $ — $ 6,854 Mortgage servicing rights — — 336 336 — 336 Non-trading derivatives and other financial assets measured on a recurring basis $ 6,230 $ 8,383 $ — $ 14,613 $ — $ 14,613 Total assets $ 424,489 $ 1,023,665 $ 16,135 $ 1,497,067 $ ( 578,983 ) $ 918,084 Total as a percentage of gross assets (5) 29.0 % 69.9 % 1.1 % Liabilities Interest-bearing deposits $ — $ 1,752 $ 206 $ 1,958 $ — $ 1,958 Securities loaned and sold under agreements to repurchase — 156,644 631 157,275 ( 97,069 ) 60,206 Trading account liabilities Securities sold, not yet purchased 85,353 14,477 214 100,044 — 100,044 Other trading liabilities — — 26 26 — 26 Total trading liabilities $ 85,353 $ 14,477 $ 240 $ 100,070 $ — $ 100,070 Trading derivatives Interest rate contracts $ 25 $ 220,607 $ 1,779 $ 222,411 Foreign exchange contracts 3 155,441 622 156,066 Equity contracts 53 58,212 5,304 63,569 Commodity contracts — 17,393 700 18,093 Credit derivatives — 9,022 1,107 10,129 Total trading derivatives $ 81 $ 460,675 $ 9,512 $ 470,268 Cash collateral received (6) $ 8,196 Netting agreements $ ( 364,879 ) Netting of cash collateral paid ( 45,628 ) Total trading derivatives $ 81 $ 460,675 $ 9,512 $ 478,464 $ ( 410,507 ) $ 67,957 Short-term borrowings $ — $ 4,464 $ 219 $ 4,683 $ — $ 4,683 Long-term debt — 41,853 25,210 67,063 — 67,063 Total non-trading derivatives and other financial liabilities measured on a recurring basis $ 6,762 $ 72 $ 1 $ 6,835 $ — $ 6,835 Total liabilities $ 92,196 $ 679,937 $ 36,019 $ 816,348 $ ( 507,576 ) $ 308,772 Total as a percentage of gross liabilities (5) 11.4 % 84.1 % 4.5 % (1) Represents netting of (i) the amounts due under securities purchased under agreements to resell and the amounts owed under securities sold under agreements to repurchase and (ii) derivative exposures covered by a qualifying master netting agreement and cash collateral offsetting.

The gains and losses presented below include changes in the fair value related to both observable and unobservable inputs. The Company often hedges positions with offsetting positions that are classified in a different level. For example, the gains and losses for assets and liabilities in the Level 3 category presented in the tables below do not reflect the effect of offsetting losses and gains on hedging instruments that may be classified in the Level 1 and Level 2 categories. In addition, the Company hedges items classified in the Level 3 category with instruments also classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The hedged items and related hedges are presented gross in the following tables: Level 3 Fair Value Rollforward Net realized/unrealized gains (losses) included in (1) Transfers Unrealized gains (losses) still held (3) In millions of dollars Dec. 31, 2019 Principal transactions Other (1)(2) into Level 3 out of Level 3 Purchases Issuances Sales Settlements Dec. 31, 2020 Assets 0 Securities borrowed and purchased under agreements to resell $ 303 $ 23 $ — $ — $ — $ 194 $ — $ — $ ( 200 ) $ 320 $ 43 Trading non-derivative assets Trading mortgage-backed securities U.S. government-sponsored agency guaranteed 10 ( 79 ) — 21 ( 11 ) 392 — ( 306 ) — 27 ( 1 ) Residential 123 79 — 234 ( 68 ) 486 — ( 514 ) — 340 ( 20 ) Commercial 61 — — 162 ( 35 ) 174 — ( 226 ) — 136 ( 14 ) Total trading mortgage-backed securities $ 194 $ — $ — $ 417 $ ( 114 ) $ 1,052 $ — $ ( 1,046 ) $ — $ 503 $ ( 35 ) U.S. Treasury and federal agency securities $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — State and municipal 64 2 — 33 ( 3 ) 62 — ( 64 ) — 94 4 Foreign government 52 ( 35 ) — 9 ( 1 ) 169 — ( 143 ) — 51 ( 7 ) Corporate 313 246 — 211 ( 136 ) 770 — ( 1,023 ) ( 6 ) 375 ( 37 ) Marketable equity securities 100 ( 16 ) — 43 ( 2 ) 240 — ( 292 ) — 73 ( 11 ) Asset-backed securities 1,177 ( 105 ) — 677 ( 131 ) 1,406 — ( 1,418 ) — 1,606 ( 248 ) Other trading assets 555 315 — 471 ( 343 ) 387 19 ( 440 ) ( 19 ) 945 ( 56 ) Total trading non-derivative assets $ 2,455 $ 407 $ — $ 1,861 $ ( 730 ) $ 4,086 $ 19 $ ( 4,426 ) $ ( 25 ) $ 3,647 $ ( 390 ) Trading derivatives, net (4) Interest rate contracts $ 1 $ 429 $ — $ 1,644 $ 16 $ 41 $ 134 $ ( 34 ) $ ( 617 ) $ 1,614 $ 161 Foreign exchange contracts ( 5 ) 105 — ( 61 ) 48 74 — ( 55 ) ( 54 ) 52 130 Equity contracts ( 1,596 ) ( 536 ) — ( 519 ) 378 35 — ( 886 ) ( 89 ) ( 3,213 ) ( 3,868 ) Commodity contracts ( 59 ) ( 1 ) — 99 ( 108 ) 101 — ( 61 ) 321 292 407 Credit derivatives ( 56 ) 123 — 173 ( 334 ) — — — 142 48 ( 136 ) Total trading derivatives, net (4) $ ( 1,715 ) $ 120 $ — $ 1,336 $ — $ 251 $ 134 $ ( 1,036 ) $ ( 297 ) $ ( 1,207 ) $ ( 3,306 ) 267 Net realized/unrealized gains (losses) included in (1) Transfers Unrealized gains (losses) still held (3) In millions of dollars Dec. 31, 2019 Principal transactions Other (1)(2) into Level 3 out of Level 3 Purchases Issuances Sales Settlements Dec. 31, 2020 Investments Mortgage-backed securities U.S. government-sponsored agency guaranteed $ 32 $ — $ ( 5 ) $ 2 $ — $ 1 $ — $ — $ — $ 30 $ ( 104 ) Residential — — 76 — — — — ( 76 ) — — 5 Commercial — — — — — — — — — — — Total investment mortgage-backed securities $ 32 $ — $ 71 $ 2 $ — $ 1 $ — $ ( 76 ) $ — $ 30 $ ( 99 ) U.S. Treasury and federal agency securities $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — State and municipal 623 — ( 3 ) 322 ( 131 ) 121 — ( 98 ) — 834 ( 20 ) Foreign government 96 — 11 27 ( 64 ) 381 — ( 183 ) — 268 ( 4 ) Corporate 45 — 6 49 ( 152 ) 162 — ( 50 ) — 60 — Marketable equity securities — — ( 1 ) 1 — — — — — — — Asset-backed securities 22 — ( 1 ) — — — — ( 20 ) — 1 ( 4 ) Other debt securities — — — — — — — — — — — Non-marketable equity securities 441 — ( 35 ) — ( 2 ) 2 3 ( 3 ) ( 57 ) 349 10 Total investments $ 1,259 $ — $ 48 $ 401 $ ( 349 ) $ 667 $ 3 $ ( 430 ) $ ( 57 ) $ 1,542 $ ( 117 ) Loans $ 402 $ — $ 1,143 $ 451 $ ( 6 ) $ — $ — $ — $ ( 5 ) $ 1,985 $ 1,424 Mortgage servicing rights 495 — ( 204 ) — — — 123 — ( 78 ) 336 ( 180 ) Other financial assets measured on a recurring basis 1 — — — — — — ( 1 ) — — — Liabilities Interest-bearing deposits $ 215 $ — $ 11 $ 278 $ ( 152 ) $ — $ 34 $ — $ ( 158 ) $ 206 $ ( 142 ) Securities loaned and sold under agreements to repurchase 757 5 — — — — — — ( 121 ) 631 ( 18 ) Trading account liabilities Securities sold, not yet purchased 48 ( 102 ) — 271 ( 17 ) — — 10 ( 200 ) 214 ( 163 ) Other trading liabilities — 9 — 35 — — — — — 26 23 Short-term borrowings 13 78 — 220 ( 6 ) — 86 — ( 16 ) 219 ( 91 ) Long-term debt 17,169 ( 1,489 ) — 6,553 ( 2,615 ) — 10,270 — ( 7,656 ) 25,210 ( 1,679 ) Other financial liabilities measured on a recurring basis — — — — — — 3 — ( 2 ) 1 — (1) Net realized/unrealized gains (losses) are presented as increase (decrease) to Level 3 assets, and as (increase) decrease to Level 3 liabilities.

Level 3 Fair Value Rollforward The following were the significant Level 3 transfers for the period December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020: • During the 12 months ended December 31, 2020, transfers of Interest rate contracts of $ 1.6 billion from Level 2 to Level 3 were due to interest rate option volatility becoming an unobservable and/or significant input relative to the overall valuation of inflation and other interest rate derivatives. • During the 12 months ended December 31, 2020, $ 6.6 billion of Long-term debt containing embedded derivatives was transferred from Level 2 to Level 3, as a result of interest rate option volatility, equity correlation and credit derivative inputs becoming unobservable and/or significant input relative to the overall valuation of certain structured long-term debt products. In other instances, market changes resulted in unobservable volatility inputs becoming insignificant to the overall valuation of the instrument (e.g., when an option becomes deep-in or deep-out of the money). This has resulted in $ 2.6 billion of certain structured long-term debt products being transferred from Level 3 to Level 2 during the 12 months ended December 31, 2020. The following were the significant Level 3 transfers for the period December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2019: • Transfers of Long-term debt of $ 3.3 billion from Level 2 to Level 3, and of $ 4.4 billion from Level 3 to Level 2, mainly related to structured debt, reflecting changes in the significance of unobservable inputs as well as certain underlying market inputs becoming less or more observable. 270 Valuation Techniques and Inputs for Level 3 Fair Value Measurements The Company’s Level 3 inventory consists of both cash instruments and derivatives of varying complexity. The valuation methodologies used to measure the fair value of these positions include discounted cash flow analysis, internal models and comparative analysis. A position is classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy when one or more unobservable inputs are used that are considered significant to its valuation. The specific reason an input is deemed unobservable varies; for example, at least one significant input to the pricing model is not observable in the market, at least one significant input has been adjusted to make it more representative of the position being valued or the price quote available does not reflect sufficient trading activities. The following tables present the valuation techniques covering the majority of Level 3 inventory and the most significant unobservable inputs used in Level 3 fair value measurements. Differences between this table and amounts presented in the Level 3 Fair Value Rollforward table represent individually immaterial items that have been measured using a variety of valuation techniques other than those listed.

(2) Some inputs are shown as zero due to rounding. (3) When the low and high inputs are the same, there is either a constant input applied to all positions, or the methodology involving the input applies to only one large position. (4) Weighted averages are calculated based on the fair values of the instruments. (5) For equity securities, the price inputs are expressed on an absolute basis, not as a percentage of the notional amount. (6) Both trading and nontrading account derivatives—assets and liabilities—are presented on a gross absolute value basis. (7) Includes hybrid products. Uncertainty of Fair Value Measurements Relating to Unobservable Inputs Valuation uncertainty arises when there is insufficient or disperse market data to allow a precise determination of the exit value of a fair-valued position or portfolio in today’s market. This is especially prevalent in Level 3 fair value instruments, where uncertainty exists in valuation inputs that may be both unobservable and significant to the instrument’s (or portfolio’s) overall fair value measurement. The uncertainties associated with key unobservable inputs on the Level 3 fair value measurements may not be independent of one another. In addition, the amount and direction of the uncertainty on a fair value measurement for a given change in an unobservable input depends on the nature of the instrument as well as whether the Company holds the instrument as an asset or a liability. For certain instruments, the pricing, hedging and risk management are sensitive to the correlation between various inputs rather than on the analysis and aggregation of the individual inputs. The following section describes some of the most significant unobservable inputs used by the Company in Level 3 fair value measurements. Correlation Correlation is a measure of the extent to which two or more variables change in relation to each other. A variety of 273 correlation-related assumptions are required for a wide range of instruments, including equity and credit baskets, foreign exchange options, CDOs backed by loans or bonds, mortgages, subprime mortgages and many other instruments. For almost all of these instruments, correlations are not directly observable in the market and must be calculated using alternative sources, including historical information. Estimating correlation can be especially difficult where it may vary over time, and calculating correlation information from market data requires significant assumptions regarding the informational efficiency of the market (e.g., swaption markets). Uncertainty therefore exists when an estimate of the appropriate level of correlation as an input into some fair value measurements is required. Changes in correlation levels can have a substantial impact, favorable or unfavorable, on the value of an instrument, depending on its nature. A change in the default correlation of the fair value of the underlying bonds comprising a CDO structure would affect the fair value of the senior tranche. For example, an increase in the default correlation of the underlying bonds would reduce the fair value of the senior tranche, because highly correlated instruments produce greater losses in the event of default and a portion of these losses would become attributable to the senior tranche. That same change in default correlation would have a different impact on junior tranches of the same structure. Volatility Volatility represents the speed and severity of market price changes and is a key factor in pricing options. Volatility generally depends on the tenor of the underlying instrument and the strike price or level defined in the contract. Volatilities for certain combinations of tenor and strike are not observable and need to be estimated using alternative methods, such as using comparable instruments, historical analysis or other sources of market information. This leads to uncertainty around the final fair value measurement of instruments with unobservable volatilities. The general relationship between changes in the value of a portfolio to changes in volatility also depends on changes in interest rates and the level of the underlying index. Generally, long option positions (assets) benefit from increases in volatility, whereas short option positions (liabilities) will suffer losses. Some instruments are more sensitive to changes in volatility than others. For example, an at-the-money option would experience a greater percentage change in its fair value than a deep-in-the-money option. In addition, the fair value of an option with more than one underlying security (e.g., an option on a basket of bonds) depends on the volatility of the individual underlying securities as well as their correlations. Yield In some circumstances, the yield of an instrument is not observable in the market and must be estimated from historical data or from yields of similar securities. This estimated yield may need to be adjusted to capture the characteristics of the security being valued. In other situations, the estimated yield may not represent sufficient market liquidity and must be adjusted as well. Whenever the amount of the adjustment is significant to the value of the security, the fair value measurement is classified as Level 3. Adjusted yield is generally used to discount the projected future principal and interest cash flows on instruments, such as asset-backed securities. Adjusted yield is impacted by changes in the interest rate environment and relevant credit spreads. Prepayment Voluntary unscheduled payments (prepayments) change the future cash flows for the investor and thereby change the fair value of the security. The effect of prepayments is more pronounced for residential mortgage-backed securities. An increase in prepayments—in speed or magnitude—generally creates losses for the holder of these securities. Prepayment is generally negatively correlated with delinquency and interest rate. A combination of low prepayments and high delinquencies amplifies each input’s negative impact on a mortgage securities’ valuation. As prepayment speeds change, the weighted average life of the security changes, which impacts the valuation either positively or negatively, depending upon the nature of the security and the direction of the change in the weighted average life. Recovery Recovery is the proportion of the total outstanding balance of a bond or loan that is expected to be collected in a liquidation scenario. For many credit securities (such as asset-backed securities), there is no directly observable market input for recovery, but indications of recovery levels are available from pricing services. The assumed recovery of a security may differ from its actual recovery that will be observable in the future. The recovery rate impacts the valuation of credit securities. Generally, an increase in the recovery rate assumption increases the fair value of the security. An increase in loss severity, the inverse of the recovery rate, reduces the amount of principal available for distribution and, as a result, decreases the fair value of the security. Credit Spread Credit spread is a component of the security representing its credit quality. Credit spread reflects the market perception of changes in prepayment, delinquency and recovery rates, therefore capturing the impact of other variables on the fair value. Changes in credit spread affect the fair value of securities differently depending on the characteristics and maturity profile of the security. For example, credit spread is a more significant driver of the fair value measurement of a high yield bond as compared to an investment grade bond. Generally, the credit spread for an investment grade bond is also more observable and less volatile than its high yield counterpart. 274 Items Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis and, therefore, are not included in the tables above. These include assets measured at cost that have been written down to fair value during the periods as a result of an impairment. These also include non-marketable equity securities that have been measured using the measurement alternative and are either (i) written down to fair value during the periods as a result of an impairment or (ii) adjusted upward or downward to fair value as a result of a transaction observed during the periods for the identical or similar investment of the same issuer. In addition, these assets include loans held-for-sale and other real estate owned that are measured at the lower of cost or market value. The following tables present the carrying amounts of all assets that were still held for which a nonrecurring fair value measurement was recorded: In millions of dollars Fair value Level 2 Level 3 December 31, 2020 Loans HFS (1) $ 3,375 $ 478 $ 2,897 Other real estate owned 17 4 13 Loans (2) 1,015 679 336 Non-marketable equity securities measured using the measurement alternative 315 312 3 Total assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis $ 4,722 $ 1,473 $ 3,249 In millions of dollars Fair value Level 2 Level 3 December 31, 2019 Loans HFS (1) $ 4,579 $ 3,249 $ 1,330 Other real estate owned 20 6 14 Loans (2) 344 93 251 Non-marketable equity securities measured using the measurement alternative 249 249 — Total assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis $ 5,192 $ 3,597 $ 1,595 (1) Net of fair value amounts on the unfunded portion of loans HFS recognized as Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. (2) Represents impaired loans held for investment whose carrying amount is based on the fair value of the underlying collateral less costs to sell, primarily real estate. The fair value of loans HFS is determined where possible using quoted secondary-market prices. If no such quoted price exists, the fair value of a loan is determined using quoted prices for a similar asset or assets, adjusted for the specific attributes of that loan. Fair value for the other real estate owned is based on appraisals. For loans whose carrying amount is based on the fair value of the underlying collateral, the fair values depend on the type of collateral. Fair value of the collateral is typically estimated based on quoted market prices if available, appraisals or other internal valuation techniques. Where the fair value of the related collateral is based on an unadjusted appraised value, the loan is generally classified as Level 2. Where significant adjustments are made to the appraised value, the loan is classified as Level 3. In addition, for corporate loans, appraisals of the collateral are often based on sales of similar assets; however, because the prices of similar assets require significant adjustments to reflect the unique features of the underlying collateral, these fair value measurements are generally classified as Level 3. The fair value of non-marketable equity securities under the measurement alternative is based on observed transaction prices for the identical or similar investment of the same issuer, or an internal valuation technique in the case of an impairment. Where significant adjustments are made to the observed transaction price or when an internal valuation technique is used, the security is classified as Level 3. Fair value may differ from the observed transaction price due to a number of factors, including marketability adjustments and differences in rights and obligations when the observed transaction is not for the identical investment held by Citi. 275 Valuation Techniques and Inputs for Level 3 Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements The following tables present the valuation techniques covering the majority of Level 3 nonrecurring fair value measurements and the most significant unobservable inputs used in those measurements: As of December 31, 2020 Fair value (1) (in millions) Methodology Input Low (2) High Weighted average (3) Loans HFS $ 2,683 Price-based Price $ 79 $ 100 $ 98 Other real estate owned $ 7 Price-based Appraised value (4) $ 3,110,711 $ 4,241,357 $ 3,586,975 4 Recovery analysis Price 51 51 51 Loans (5) $ 147 Price-based Price $ 2 $ 49 $ 23 73 Recovery analysis Recovery rate 0.99 % 78.00 % 13.37 % Appraised value (4) $ 34 $ 43,646,426 $ 17,762,950 As of December 31, 2019 Fair value (1) (in millions) Methodology Input Low (2) High Weighted average (3) Loans HFS $ 1,320 Price-based Price $ 86 $ 100 $ 99 Other real estate owned $ 11 Price-based Appraised value (4) $ 2,297,358 $ 8,394,102 $ 5,615,884 5 Recovery analysis Loans (5) $ 100 Recovery analysis Recovery rate 0.57 % 100.00 % 64.78 % 54 Cash flow Price $ 2 $ 54 $ 27 47 Price-based Cost of capital 0.10 % 100.00 % 54.84 % 66 Price-based Price $ 17,521,218 $ 43,646,426 $ 30,583,822 (1) The fair value amounts presented in this table represent the primary valuation technique or techniques for each class of assets or liabilities.

The tables below therefore exclude items measured at fair value on a recurring basis presented in the tables above. The disclosure also excludes leases, affiliate investments, pension and benefit obligations, certain insurance contracts and tax-related items. Also, as required, the disclosure excludes the effect of taxes, any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time the entire holdings of a particular instrument, excess fair value associated with deposits with no fixed maturity and other expenses that would be incurred in a market transaction. In addition, the tables exclude the values of non-financial assets and liabilities, as well as a wide range of franchise, relationship and intangible values, which are integral to a full assessment of Citigroup’s financial position and the value of its net assets. Fair values vary from period to period based on changes in a wide range of factors, including interest rates, credit quality and market perceptions of value, and as existing assets and liabilities run off and new transactions are entered into.

In addition, the carrying values exclude $ 0.7 billion and $ 1.4 billion of lease finance receivables at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. (2) Includes items measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. (3) Includes cash and due from banks, deposits with banks, brokerage receivables, reinsurance recoverables and other financial instruments included in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, for all of which the carrying value is a reasonable estimate of fair value. (4) The carrying value includes long-term debt balances under qualifying fair value hedges. 277 (5) Includes brokerage payables, separate and variable accounts, short-term borrowings (carried at cost) and other financial instruments included in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, for all of which the carrying value is a reasonable estimate of fair value. The estimated fair values of the Company’s corporate unfunded lending commitments at December 31, 2020 and 2019 were liabilities of $ 7.3 billion and $ 5.1 billion, respectively, substantially all of which are classified as Level 3. The Company does not estimate the fair values of consumer unfunded lending commitments, which are generally cancelable by providing notice to the borrower. 278 25. FAIR VALUE ELECTIONS The Company may elect to report most financial instruments and certain other items at fair value on an instrument-by-instrument basis with changes in fair value reported in earnings, other than DVA (see below). The election is made upon the initial recognition of an eligible financial asset, financial liability or firm commitment or when certain specified reconsideration events occur. The fair value election may not otherwise be revoked once an election is made. The changes in fair value are recorded in current earnings. Movements in DVA are reported as a component of AOCI . Additional discussion regarding the applicable areas in which fair value elections were made is presented in Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company has elected fair value accounting for its mortgage servicing rights (MSRs). See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussions regarding the accounting and reporting of MSRs. The following table presents the changes in fair value of those items for which the fair value option has been elected: Changes in fair value—gains (losses) for the years ended December 31, In millions of dollars 2020 2019 Assets Securities borrowed and purchased under agreements to resell $ — $ 6 Trading account assets ( 136 ) 77 Investments — — Loans Certain corporate loans 2,486 ( 222 ) Certain consumer loans 1 — Total loans $ 2,487 $ ( 222 ) Other assets MSRs $ ( 204 ) $ ( 84 ) Certain mortgage loans HFS (1) 299 91 Total other assets $ 95 $ 7 Total assets $ 2,446 $ ( 132 ) Liabilities Interest-bearing deposits $ ( 154 ) $ ( 205 ) Securities loaned and sold under agreements to repurchase ( 559 ) 386 Trading account liabilities ( 1 ) 27 Short-term borrowings (2) 802 ( 78 ) Long-term debt (2) ( 2,700 ) ( 5,174 ) Total liabilities $ ( 2,612 ) $ ( 5,044 ) (1)    Includes gains (losses) associated with interest rate lock commitments for those loans that have been originated and elected under the fair value option. (2)     Includes DVA that is included in AOCI . See Notes 19 and 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 279 Own Debt Valuation Adjustments (DVA) Own debt valuation adjustments are recognized on Citi’s liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected using Citi’s credit spreads observed in the bond market. Changes in fair value of fair value option liabilities related to changes in Citigroup’s own credit spreads (DVA) are reflected as a component of AOCI . See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Among other variables, the fair value of liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected (other than non-recourse debt and similar liabilities) is impacted by the narrowing or widening of the Company’s credit spreads. The estimated changes in the fair value of these non-derivative liabilities due to such changes in the Company’s own credit spread (or instrument-specific credit risk) were a loss of $ 616 million and a loss of $ 1,473 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Changes in fair value resulting from changes in instrument-specific credit risk were estimated by incorporating the Company’s current credit spreads observable in the bond market into the relevant valuation technique used to value each liability as described above. The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Selected Portfolios of Securities Purchased Under Agreements to Resell, Securities Borrowed, Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase, Securities Loaned and Certain Non-Collateralized Short-Term Borrowings The Company elected the fair value option for certain portfolios of fixed income securities purchased under agreements to resell and fixed income securities sold under agreements to repurchase, securities borrowed, securities loaned and certain uncollateralized short-term borrowings held primarily by broker-dealer entities in the United States, the United Kingdom and Japan. In each case, the election was made because the related interest rate risk is managed on a portfolio basis, primarily with offsetting derivative instruments that are accounted for at fair value through earnings. Changes in fair value for transactions in these portfolios are recorded in Principal transactions . The related interest revenue and interest expense are measured based on the contractual rates specified in the transactions and are reported as Interest revenue and Interest expense in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Certain Loans and Other Credit Products Citigroup has also elected the fair value option for certain other originated and purchased loans, including certain unfunded loan products, such as guarantees and letters of credit, executed by Citigroup’s lending and trading businesses. None of these credit products are highly leveraged financing commitments. Significant groups of transactions include loans and unfunded loan products that are expected to be either sold or securitized in the near term, or transactions where the economic risks are hedged with derivative instruments, such as purchased credit default swaps or total return swaps where the Company pays the total return on the underlying loans to a third party. Citigroup has elected the fair value option to mitigate accounting mismatches in cases where hedge accounting is complex and to achieve operational simplifications. Fair value was not elected for most lending transactions across the Company. The following table provides information about certain credit products carried at fair value: December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 In millions of dollars Trading assets Loans Trading assets Loans Carrying amount reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet $ 8,063 $ 6,854 $ 8,320 $ 4,086 Aggregate unpaid principal balance in excess of (less than) fair value ( 915 ) ( 14 ) 410 315 Balance of non-accrual loans or loans more than 90 days past due — 4 — 1 Aggregate unpaid principal balance in excess of (less than) fair value for non-accrual loans or loans more than 90 days past due — — — — In addition to the amounts reported above, $ 1,068 million and $ 1,062 million of unfunded commitments related to certain credit products selected for fair value accounting were outstanding as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 280 Changes in the fair value of funded and unfunded credit products are classified in Principal transactions in Citi’s Consolidated Statement of Income. Related interest revenue is measured based on the contractual interest rates and reported as Interest revenue on Trading account assets or loan interest depending on the balance sheet classifications of the credit products. The changes in fair value for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 due to instrument-specific credit risk totaled to a loss of $( 16 ) million and a gain of $ 95 million, respectively. Certain Investments in Unallocated Precious Metals Citigroup invests in unallocated precious metals accounts (gold, silver, platinum and palladium) as part of its commodity and foreign currency trading activities or to economically hedge certain exposures from issuing structured liabilities. Under ASC 815, the investment is bifurcated into a debt host contract and a commodity forward derivative instrument. Citigroup elects the fair value option for the debt host contract, and reports the debt host contract within Trading account assets on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. The total carrying amount of debt host contracts across unallocated precious metals accounts was approximately $ 0.5 billion and $ 0.2 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The amounts are expected to fluctuate based on trading activity in future periods. As part of its commodity and foreign currency trading activities, Citi trades unallocated precious metals investments and executes forward purchase and forward sale derivative contracts with trading counterparties. When Citi sells an unallocated precious metals investment, Citi’s receivable from its depository bank is repaid and Citi derecognizes its investment in the unallocated precious metal. The forward purchase or sale contract with the trading counterparty indexed to unallocated precious metals is accounted for as a derivative, at fair value through earnings. As of December 31, 2020, there were approximately $ 7.4 billion and $ 6.3 billion in notional amounts of such forward purchase and forward sale derivative contracts outstanding, respectively. Certain Investments in Private Equity and Real Estate Ventures Citigroup invests in private equity and real estate ventures for the purpose of earning investment returns and for capital appreciation. The Company has elected the fair value option for certain of these ventures, because such investments are considered similar to many private equity or hedge fund activities in Citi’s investment companies, which are reported at fair value. The fair value option brings consistency in the accounting and evaluation of these investments. All investments (debt and equity) in such private equity and real estate entities are accounted for at fair value. These investments are classified as Investments on Citigroup’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. Changes in the fair values of these investments are classified in Other revenue in the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Income. Certain Mortgage Loans Held-for-Sale (HFS) Citigroup has elected the fair value option for certain purchased and originated prime fixed-rate and conforming adjustable-rate first mortgage loans HFS. These loans are intended for sale or securitization and are hedged with derivative instruments. The Company has elected the fair value option to mitigate accounting mismatches in cases where hedge accounting is complex and to achieve operational simplifications. The following table provides information about certain mortgage loans HFS carried at fair value: In millions of dollars December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 Carrying amount reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet $ 1,742 $ 1,254 Aggregate fair value in excess of (less than) unpaid principal balance 91 ( 31 ) Balance of non-accrual loans or loans more than 90 days past due — 1 Aggregate unpaid principal balance in excess of fair value for non-accrual loans or loans more than 90 days past due — — The changes in the fair values of these mortgage loans are reported in Other revenue in the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Income. There was no net change in fair value during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 due to instrument-specific credit risk. Related interest income continues to be measured based on the contractual interest rates and reported as Interest revenue in the Consolidated Statement of Income. 281 Certain Structured Liabilities The Company has elected the fair value option for certain structured liabilities whose performance is linked to structured interest rates, inflation, currency, equity, referenced credit or commodity risks. The Company elected the fair value option because these exposures are considered to be trading-related positions and, therefore, are managed on a fair value basis. These positions will continue to be classified as debt, deposits or derivatives ( Trading account liabilities ) on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet according to their legal form. The following table provides information about the carrying value of structured notes, disaggregated by type of embedded derivative instrument: In billions of dollars December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 Interest rate linked $ 16.0 $ 22.6 Foreign exchange linked 1.2 0.7 Equity linked 27.3 23.7 Commodity linked 1.4 1.8 Credit linked 2.6 0.9 Total $ 48.5 $ 49.7 The portion of the changes in fair value attributable to changes in Citigroup’s own credit spreads (DVA) is reflected as a component of AOCI while all other changes in fair value are reported in Principal transactions . Changes in the fair value of these structured liabilities include accrued interest, which is also included in the change in fair value reported in Principal transactions . Certain Non-Structured Liabilities The Company has elected the fair value option for certain non-structured liabilities with fixed and floating interest rates. The Company has elected the fair value option where the interest rate risk of such liabilities may be economically hedged with derivative contracts or the proceeds are used to purchase financial assets that will also be accounted for at fair value through earnings. The elections have been made to mitigate accounting mismatches and to achieve operational simplifications. These positions are reported in Short-term borrowings and Long-term debt on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. The portion of the changes in fair value attributable to changes in Citigroup’s own credit spreads (DVA) is reflected as a component of AOCI while all other changes in fair value are reported in Principal transactions . Interest expense on non-structured liabilities is measured based on the contractual interest rates and reported as Interest expense in the Consolidated Statement of Income. The following table provides information about long-term debt carried at fair value: In millions of dollars December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 Carrying amount reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet $ 67,063 $ 55,783 Aggregate unpaid principal balance in excess of (less than) fair value ( 5,130 ) ( 2,967 ) The following table provides information about short-term borrowings carried at fair value: In millions of dollars December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 Carrying amount reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet $ 4,683 $ 4,946 Aggregate unpaid principal balance in excess of (less than) fair value 68 1,411 282 26. PLEDGED ASSETS, COLLATERAL, GUARANTEES AND COMMITMENTS Pledged Assets In connection with Citi’s financing and trading activities, Citi has pledged assets to collateralize its obligations under repurchase agreements, secured financing agreements, secured liabilities of consolidated VIEs and other borrowings. The approximate carrying values of the significant components of pledged assets recognized on Citi’s Consolidated Balance Sheet included the following: In millions of dollars December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 Investment securities $ 231,696 $ 152,352 Loans 239,699 236,033 Trading account assets 174,717 131,392 Total $ 646,112 $ 519,777 Restricted Cash Citigroup defines restricted cash (as cash subject to withdrawal restrictions) to include cash deposited with central banks that must be maintained to meet minimum regulatory requirements, and cash set aside for the benefit of customers or for other purposes such as compensating balance arrangements or debt retirement. Restricted cash includes minimum reserve requirements with the Federal Reserve Bank and certain other central banks and cash segregated to satisfy rules regarding the protection of customer assets as required by Citigroup broker-dealers’ primary regulators, including the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the United Kingdom’s Prudential Regulation Authority. Restricted cash is included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet within the following balance sheet lines: In millions of dollars December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 Cash and due from banks $ 3,774 $ 3,758 Deposits with banks, net of allowance 14,203 26,493 Total $ 17,977 $ 30,251 In addition, included in Cash and due from banks and Deposits with banks at December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $ 9.4 billion and $ 8.5 billion, respectively, of cash segregated under federal and other brokerage regulations or deposited with clearing organizations. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve Bank and certain other central banks eased regulations related to minimum required cash deposited with central banks. This resulted in a decrease in Citigroup’s restricted cash amount at December 31, 2020. Collateral At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the approximate fair value of collateral received by Citi that may be resold or repledged, excluding the impact of allowable netting, was $ 671.6 billion and $ 569.8 billion, respectively. This collateral was received in connection with resale agreements, securities borrowings and loans, securities for securities lending transactions, derivative transactions and margined broker loans. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, a substantial portion of the collateral received by Citi had been sold or repledged in connection with repurchase agreements, securities sold, not yet purchased, securities lendings, pledges to clearing organizations, segregation requirements under securities laws and regulations, derivative transactions and bank loans. In addition, at December 31, 2020 and 2019, Citi had pledged $ 470.7 billion and $ 388.9 billion, respectively, of collateral that may not be sold or repledged by the secured parties. Leases The Company’s operating leases, where Citi is a lessee, include real estate, such as office space and branches, and various types of equipment. These leases may contain renewal and extension options and early termination features. However, these options do not impact the lease term unless the Company is reasonably certain that it will exercise the options. These leases have a weighted-average remaining lease term of approximately six years as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. The operating lease ROU asset was $ 2.8 billion and $ 3.1 billion, as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The operating lease ROU liability was $ 3.1 billion and $ 3.3 billion, as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Company recognizes fixed lease costs on a straight-line basis throughout the lease term in the Consolidated Statement of Income. In addition, variable lease costs are recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred. The total operating lease expense (principally for offices, branches and equipment), net of $ 27 million and $ 56 million of sublease income, was $ 1,054 million and $ 1,084 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. During 2019, Citi purchased a previously leased property in London. The purchased property is included in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at both December 31, 2020 and 2019. The table below provides the Cash Flow Statement Supplemental Information: In millions of dollars December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities $ 814 $ 942 Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new operating lease liabilities (1)(2) 447 499 (1)     Represents non-cash activity and, accordingly, is not reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flow. (2)    Excludes the decrease in the right-of-use assets related to the purchase of a previously leased property. 283 Citi’s future lease payments are as follows: In millions of dollars 2021 $ 791 2022 663 2023 518 2024 399 2025 307 Thereafter 766 Total future lease payments $ 3,444 Less imputed interest (based on weighted-average discount rate of 3.6 %) $ ( 356 ) Lease liability $ 3,088 Operating lease expense was $ 1.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018. Guarantees Citi provides a variety of guarantees and indemnifications to its customers to enhance their credit standing and enable them to complete a wide variety of business transactions. For certain contracts meeting the definition of a guarantee, the guarantor must recognize, at inception, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. In addition, the guarantor must disclose the maximum potential amount of future payments that the guarantor could be required to make under the guarantee, if there were a total default by the guaranteed parties. The determination of the maximum potential future payments is based on the notional amount of the guarantees without consideration of possible recoveries under recourse provisions or from collateral held or pledged. As such, Citi believes such amounts bear no relationship to the anticipated losses, if any, on these guarantees. 284 The following tables present information about Citi’s guarantees: Maximum potential amount of future payments In billions of dollars at December 31, 2020 Expire within 1 year Expire after 1 year Total amount outstanding Carrying value (in millions of dollars) Financial standby letters of credit $ 25.3 $ 68.4 $ 93.7 $ 1,407 Performance guarantees 7.3 6.0 13.3 72 Derivative instruments considered to be guarantees 20.0 60.9 80.9 671 Loans sold with recourse — 1.2 1.2 9 Securities lending indemnifications (1) 112.2 — 112.2 — Credit card merchant processing (1)(2) 101.9 — 101.9 3 Credit card arrangements with partners 0.2 0.8 1.0 7 Custody indemnifications and other — 37.3 37.3 35 Total $ 266.9 $ 174.6 $ 441.5 $ 2,204 Maximum potential amount of future payments In billions of dollars at December 31, 2019 Expire within 1 year Expire after 1 year Total amount outstanding Carrying value (in millions of dollars) Financial standby letters of credit $ 31.9 $ 61.4 $ 93.3 $ 581 Performance guarantees 6.9 5.5 12.4 36 Derivative instruments considered to be guarantees 35.2 60.8 96.0 474 Loans sold with recourse — 1.2 1.2 7 Securities lending indemnifications (1) 87.8 — 87.8 — Credit card merchant processing (1)(2) 91.6 — 91.6 — Credit card arrangements with partners 0.2 0.4 0.6 23 Custody indemnifications and other — 33.7 33.7 41 Total $ 253.6 $ 163.0 $ 416.6 $ 1,162 (1) The carrying values of securities lending indemnifications and credit card merchant processing were not material for either period presented, as the probability of potential liabilities arising from these guarantees is minimal. (2) At December 31, 2020 and 2019, this maximum potential exposure was estimated to be $ 102 billion and $ 92 billion, respectively. However, Citi believes that the maximum exposure is not representative of the actual potential loss exposure based on its historical experience. This contingent liability is unlikely to arise, as most products and services are delivered when purchased and amounts are refunded when items are returned to merchants. Financial Standby Letters of Credit Citi issues standby letters of credit, which substitute its own credit for that of the borrower. If a letter of credit is drawn down, the borrower is obligated to repay Citi. Standby letters of credit protect a third party from defaults on contractual obligations. Financial standby letters of credit include (i) guarantees of payment of insurance premiums and reinsurance risks that support industrial revenue bond underwriting, (ii) settlement of payment obligations to clearing houses, including futures and over-the-counter derivatives clearing (see further discussion below), (iii) support options and purchases of securities in lieu of escrow deposit accounts and (iv) letters of credit that backstop loans, credit facilities, promissory notes and trade acceptances. Performance Guarantees Performance guarantees and letters of credit are issued to guarantee a customer’s tender bid on a construction or systems-installation project or to guarantee completion of such projects in accordance with contract terms. They are also issued to support a customer’s obligation to supply specified products, commodities or maintenance or warranty services to a third party. Derivative Instruments Considered to Be Guarantees Derivatives are financial instruments whose cash flows are based on a notional amount and an underlying instrument, reference credit or index, where there is little or no initial investment, and whose terms require or permit net settlement. For a discussion of Citi’s derivatives activities, see Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Derivative instruments considered to be guarantees include only those instruments that require Citi to make payments to the counterparty based on changes in an underlying instrument that is related to an asset, a liability or an equity security held by the guaranteed party. More specifically, derivative instruments considered to be guarantees include certain over-the-counter written put options 285 where the counterparty is not a bank, hedge fund or broker-dealer (such counterparties are considered to be dealers in these markets and may, therefore, not hold the underlying instruments). Credit derivatives sold by Citi are excluded from the tables above as they are disclosed separately in Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In instances where Citi’s maximum potential future payment is unlimited, the notional amount of the contract is disclosed. Loans Sold with Recourse Loans sold with recourse represent Citi’s obligations to reimburse the buyers for loan losses under certain circumstances. Recourse refers to the clause in a sales agreement under which a seller/lender will fully reimburse the buyer/investor for any losses resulting from the purchased loans. This may be accomplished by the seller’s taking back any loans that become delinquent. In addition to the amounts shown in the tables above, Citi has recorded a repurchase reserve for its potential repurchases or make-whole liability regarding residential mortgage representation and warranty claims related to its whole loan sales to U.S. government-sponsored agencies and, to a lesser extent, private investors. The repurchase reserve was approximately $ 31 million and $ 37 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and these amounts are included in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Securities Lending Indemnifications Owners of securities frequently lend those securities for a fee to other parties who may sell them short or deliver them to another party to satisfy some other obligation. Banks may administer such securities lending programs for their clients. Securities lending indemnifications are issued by the bank to guarantee that a securities lending customer will be made whole in the event that the security borrower does not return the security subject to the lending agreement and collateral held is insufficient to cover the market value of the security. Credit Card Merchant Processing Credit card merchant processing guarantees represent the Company’s indirect obligations in connection with (i) providing transaction processing services to various merchants with respect to its private label cards and (ii) potential liability for bank card transaction processing services. The nature of the liability in either case arises as a result of a billing dispute between a merchant and a cardholder that is ultimately resolved in the cardholder’s favor. The merchant is liable to refund the amount to the cardholder. In general, if the credit card processing company is unable to collect this amount from the merchant, the credit card processing company bears the loss for the amount of the credit or refund paid to the cardholder. With regard to (i) above, Citi has the primary contingent liability with respect to its portfolio of private label merchants. The risk of loss is mitigated as the cash flows between Citi and the merchant are settled on a net basis, and Citi has the right to offset any payments with cash flows otherwise due to the merchant. To further mitigate this risk, Citi may delay settlement, require a merchant to make an escrow deposit, include event triggers to provide Citi with more financial and operational control in the event of the financial deterioration of the merchant or require various credit enhancements (including letters of credit and bank guarantees). In the unlikely event that a private label merchant is unable to deliver products, services or a refund to its private label cardholders, Citi is contingently liable to credit or refund cardholders. With regard to (ii) above, Citi has a potential liability for bank card transactions where Citi provides the transaction processing services as well as those where a third party provides the services and Citi acts as a secondary guarantor, should that processor fail to perform. Citi’s maximum potential contingent liability related to both bank card and private label merchant processing services is estimated to be the total volume of credit card transactions that meet the requirements to be valid charge-back transactions at any given time. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, this maximum potential exposure was estimated to be $ 101.9 billion and $ 91.6 billion, respectively. However, Citi believes that the maximum exposure is not representative of the actual potential loss exposure based on its historical experience. This contingent liability is unlikely to arise, as most products and services are delivered when purchased and amounts are refunded when items are returned to merchants. Citi assesses the probability and amount of its contingent liability related to merchant processing based on the financial strength of the primary guarantor, the extent and nature of unresolved charge-backs and its historical loss experience. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the losses incurred and the carrying amounts of Citi’s contingent obligations related to merchant processing activities were immaterial. Credit Card Arrangements with Partners Citi, in one of its credit card partner arrangements, provides guarantees to the partner regarding the volume of certain customer originations during the term of the agreement. To the extent that such origination targets are not met, the guarantees serve to compensate the partner for certain payments that otherwise would have been generated in connection with such originations. Custody Indemnifications Custody indemnifications are issued to guarantee that custody clients will be made whole in the event that a third-party subcustodian or depository institution fails to safeguard clients’ assets. 286 Other Guarantees and Indemnifications Credit Card Protection Programs Citi, through its credit card businesses, provides various cardholder protection programs on several of its card products, including programs that provide insurance coverage for rental cars, coverage for certain losses associated with purchased products, price protection for certain purchases and protection for lost luggage. These guarantees are not included in the table, since the total outstanding amount of the guarantees and Citi’s maximum exposure to loss cannot be quantified. The protection is limited to certain types of purchases and losses, and it is not possible to quantify the purchases that would qualify for these benefits at any given time. Citi assesses the probability and amount of its potential liability related to these programs based on the extent and nature of its historical loss experience. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the actual and estimated losses incurred and the carrying value of Citi’s obligations related to these programs were immaterial. Other Representation and Warranty Indemnifications In the normal course of business, Citi provides standard representations and warranties to counterparties in contracts in connection with numerous transactions and also provides indemnifications, including indemnifications that protect the counterparties to the contracts in the event that additional taxes are owed, due either to a change in the tax law or an adverse interpretation of the tax law. Counterparties to these transactions provide Citi with comparable indemnifications. While such representations, warranties and indemnifications are essential components of many contractual relationships, they do not represent the underlying business purpose for the transactions. The indemnification clauses are often standard contractual terms related to Citi’s own performance under the terms of a contract and are entered into in the normal course of business based on an assessment that the risk of loss is remote. Often these clauses are intended to ensure that terms of a contract are met at inception. No compensation is received for these standard representations and warranties, and it is not possible to determine their fair value because they rarely, if ever, result in a payment. In many cases, there are no stated or notional amounts included in the indemnification clauses, and the contingencies potentially triggering the obligation to indemnify have not occurred and are not expected to occur. As a result, these indemnifications are not included in the tables above. Value-Transfer Networks (Including Exchanges and Clearing Houses) (VTNs) Citi is a member of, or shareholder in, hundreds of value-transfer networks (VTNs) (payment, clearing and settlement systems as well as exchanges) around the world. As a condition of membership, many of these VTNs require that members stand ready to pay a pro rata share of the losses incurred by the organization due to another member’s default on its obligations. Citi’s potential obligations may be limited to its membership interests in the VTNs, contributions to the VTN’s funds, or, in certain narrow cases, to the full pro rata share. The maximum exposure is difficult to estimate as this would require an assessment of claims that have not yet occurred; however, Citi believes the risk of loss is remote given historical experience with the VTNs. Accordingly, Citi’s participation in VTNs is not reported in the guarantees tables above, and there are no amounts reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2020 or 2019 for potential obligations that could arise from Citi’s involvement with VTN associations. Long-Term Care Insurance Indemnification In 2000, Travelers Life & Annuity (Travelers), then a subsidiary of Citi, entered into a reinsurance agreement to transfer the risks and rewards of its long-term care (LTC) business to GE Life (now Genworth Financial Inc., or Genworth), then a subsidiary of the General Electric Company (GE). As part of this transaction, the reinsurance obligations were provided by two regulated insurance subsidiaries of GE Life, which funded two collateral trusts with securities. Presently, as discussed below, the trusts are referred to as the Genworth Trusts. As part of GE’s spin-off of Genworth in 2004, GE retained the risks and rewards associated with the 2000 Travelers reinsurance agreement by providing a reinsurance contract to Genworth through GE’s Union Fidelity Life Insurance Company (UFLIC) subsidiary that covers the Travelers LTC policies. In addition, GE provided a capital maintenance agreement in favor of UFLIC that is designed to assure that UFLIC will have the funds to pay its reinsurance obligations. As a result of these reinsurance agreements and the spin-off of Genworth, Genworth has reinsurance protection from UFLIC (supported by GE) and has reinsurance obligations in connection with the Travelers LTC policies. As noted below, the Genworth reinsurance obligations now benefit Brighthouse Financial, Inc. (Brighthouse). While neither Brighthouse nor Citi are direct beneficiaries of the capital maintenance agreement between GE and UFLIC, Brighthouse and Citi benefit indirectly from the existence of the capital maintenance agreement, which helps assure that UFLIC will continue to have funds necessary to pay its reinsurance obligations to Genworth. In connection with Citi’s 2005 sale of Travelers to MetLife Inc. (MetLife), Citi provided an indemnification to MetLife for losses (including policyholder claims) relating to the LTC business for the entire term of the Travelers LTC policies, which, as noted above, are reinsured by subsidiaries of Genworth. In 2017, MetLife spun off its retail insurance business to Brighthouse. As a result, the Travelers LTC policies now reside with Brighthouse. The original reinsurance agreement between Travelers (now Brighthouse) and Genworth remains in place and Brighthouse is the sole beneficiary of the Genworth Trusts. The Genworth Trusts are designed to provide collateral to Brighthouse in an amount equal to the statutory liabilities of Brighthouse in respect of the Travelers LTC policies. The assets in the Genworth Trusts are evaluated and adjusted periodically to ensure that the fair value of the assets continues to provide collateral in an amount equal to these estimated statutory liabilities, as the liabilities change over time. If both (i) Genworth fails to perform under the original Travelers/GE Life reinsurance agreement for any reason, 287 including its insolvency or the failure of UFLIC to perform under its reinsurance contract or GE to perform under the capital maintenance agreement, and (ii) the assets of the two Genworth Trusts are insufficient or unavailable, then Citi, through its LTC reinsurance indemnification, must reimburse Brighthouse for any losses incurred in connection with the LTC policies. Since both events would have to occur before Citi would become responsible for any payment to Brighthouse pursuant to its indemnification obligation, and the likelihood of such events occurring is currently not probable, there is no liability reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 related to this indemnification. However, if both events become reasonably possible (meaning more than remote but less than probable), Citi will be required to estimate and disclose a reasonably possible loss or range of loss to the extent that such an estimate could be made. In addition, if both events become probable, Citi will be required to accrue for such liability in accordance with applicable accounting principles. Citi continues to closely monitor its potential exposure under this indemnification obligation, given GE’s 2018 LTC and other charges and the September 2019 AM Best credit ratings downgrade for the Genworth subsidiaries. Separately, Genworth announced that it had agreed to be purchased by China Oceanwide Holdings Co., Ltd, subject to a series of conditions and regulatory approvals. Citi is monitoring these developments. Futures and Over-the-Counter Derivatives Clearing Citi provides clearing services on central clearing parties (CCPs) for clients that need to clear exchange-traded and over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives contracts with CCPs. Based on all relevant facts and circumstances, Citi has concluded that it acts as an agent for accounting purposes in its role as clearing member for these client transactions. As such, Citi does not reflect the underlying exchange-traded or OTC derivatives contracts in its Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 22 for a discussion of Citi’s derivatives activities that are reflected in its Consolidated Financial Statements. As a clearing member, Citi collects and remits cash and securities collateral (margin) between its clients and the respective CCP. In certain circumstances, Citi collects a higher amount of cash (or securities) from its clients than it needs to remit to the CCPs. This excess cash is then held at depository institutions such as banks or carry brokers. There are two types of margin: initial and variation. Where Citi obtains benefits from or controls cash initial margin (e.g., retains an interest spread), cash initial margin collected from clients and remitted to the CCP or depository institutions is reflected within Brokerage payables (payables to customers) and Brokerage receivables (receivables from brokers, dealers and clearing organizations) or Cash and due from banks , respectively. However, for exchange-traded and OTC-cleared derivatives contracts where Citi does not obtain benefits from or control the client cash balances, the client cash initial margin collected from clients and remitted to the CCP or depository institutions is not reflected on Citi’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. These conditions are met when Citi has contractually agreed with the client that (i) Citi will pass through to the client all interest paid by the CCP or depository institutions on the cash initial margin, (ii) Citi will not utilize its right as a clearing member to transform cash margin into other assets, (iii) Citi does not guarantee and is not liable to the client for the performance of the CCP or the depository institution and (iv) the client cash balances are legally isolated from Citi’s bankruptcy estate. The total amount of cash initial margin collected and remitted in this manner was approximately $ 16.6 billion and $ 13.3 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Variation margin due from clients to the respective CCP, or from the CCP to clients, reflects changes in the value of the client’s derivative contracts for each trading day. As a clearing member, Citi is exposed to the risk of non-performance by clients (e.g., failure of a client to post variation margin to the CCP for negative changes in the value of the client’s derivative contracts). In the event of non-performance by a client, Citi would move to close out the client’s positions. The CCP would typically utilize initial margin posted by the client and held by the CCP, with any remaining shortfalls required to be paid by Citi as clearing member. Citi generally holds incremental cash or securities margin posted by the client, which would typically be expected to be sufficient to mitigate Citi’s credit risk in the event that the client fails to perform. As required by ASC 860-30-25-5, securities collateral posted by clients is not recognized on Citi’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. 288 Carrying Value—Guarantees and Indemnifications At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the total carrying amounts of the liabilities related to the guarantees and indemnifications included in the tables above amounted to approximately $ 2.2 billion and $ 1.2 billion, respectively. The carrying value of financial and performance guarantees is included in Other liabilities. For loans sold with recourse, the carrying value of the liability is included in Other liabilities . Collateral Cash collateral available to Citi to reimburse losses realized under these guarantees and indemnifications amounted to $ 51.6 billion and $ 46.7 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Securities and other marketable assets held as collateral amounted to $ 80.1 billion and $ 58.6 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The majority of collateral is held to reimburse losses realized under securities lending indemnifications. In addition, letters of credit in favor of Citi held as collateral amounted to $ 6.6 billion and $ 4.4 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Other property may also be available to Citi to cover losses under certain guarantees and indemnifications; however, the value of such property has not been determined. Performance Risk Citi evaluates the performance risk of its guarantees based on the assigned referenced counterparty internal or external ratings. Where external ratings are used, investment-grade ratings are considered to be Baa/BBB and above, while anything below is considered non-investment grade. Citi’s internal ratings are in line with the related external rating system. On certain underlying referenced assets or entities, ratings are not available. Such referenced assets are included in the “not rated” category. The maximum potential amount of the future payments related to the outstanding guarantees is determined to be the notional amount of these contracts, which is the par amount of the assets guaranteed. Presented in the tables below are the maximum potential amounts of future payments that are classified based on internal and external credit ratings. The determination of the maximum potential future payments is based on the notional amount of the guarantees without consideration of possible recoveries under recourse provisions or from collateral held or pledged. As such, Citi believes such amounts bear no relationship to the anticipated losses, if any, on these guarantees. Maximum potential amount of future payments In billions of dollars at December 31, 2020 Investment grade Non-investment grade Not rated Total Financial standby letters of credit $ 78.5 $ 14.6 $ 0.6 $ 93.7 Performance guarantees 9.8 3.0 0.5 13.3 Derivative instruments deemed to be guarantees — — 80.9 80.9 Loans sold with recourse — — 1.2 1.2 Securities lending indemnifications — — 112.2 112.2 Credit card merchant processing — — 101.9 101.9 Credit card arrangements with partners — — 1.0 1.0 Custody indemnifications and other 24.9 12.4 — 37.3 Total $ 113.2 $ 30.0 $ 298.3 $ 441.5 Maximum potential amount of future payments In billions of dollars at December 31, 2019 Investment grade Non-investment grade Not rated Total Financial standby letters of credit $ 81.2 $ 11.6 $ 0.5 $ 93.3 Performance guarantees 9.7 2.3 0.4 12.4 Derivative instruments deemed to be guarantees — — 96.0 96.0 Loans sold with recourse — — 1.2 1.2 Securities lending indemnifications — — 87.8 87.8 Credit card merchant processing — — 91.6 91.6 Credit card arrangements with partners — — 0.6 0.6 Custody indemnifications and other 21.3 12.4 — 33.7 Total $ 112.2 $ 26.3 $ 278.1 $ 416.6 289 Credit Commitments and Lines of Credit The table below summarizes Citigroup’s credit commitments: In millions of dollars U.S. Outside of U.S. December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 Commercial and similar letters of credit $ 658 $ 4,563 $ 5,221 $ 4,533 One- to four-family residential mortgages 2,654 2,348 5,002 3,721 Revolving open-end loans secured by one- to four-family residential properties 8,326 1,300 9,626 10,799 Commercial real estate, construction and land development 11,256 1,611 12,867 12,981 Credit card lines 606,768 103,631 710,399 708,023 Commercial and other consumer loan commitments 201,969 120,489 322,458 324,359 Other commitments and contingencies 5,177 538 5,715 1,948 Total $ 836,808 $ 234,480 $ 1,071,288 $ 1,066,364 The majority of unused commitments are contingent upon customers’ maintaining specific credit standards. Commercial commitments generally have floating interest rates and fixed expiration dates and may require payment of fees. Such fees (net of certain direct costs) are deferred and, upon exercise of the commitment, amortized over the life of the loan or, if exercise is deemed remote, amortized over the commitment period. Commercial and Similar Letters of Credit A commercial letter of credit is an instrument by which Citigroup substitutes its credit for that of a customer to enable the customer to finance the purchase of goods or to incur other commitments. Citigroup issues a letter on behalf of its client to a supplier and agrees to pay the supplier upon presentation of documentary evidence that the supplier has performed in accordance with the terms of the letter of credit. When a letter of credit is drawn, the customer is then required to reimburse Citigroup. One- to Four-Family Residential Mortgages A one- to four-family residential mortgage commitment is a written confirmation from Citigroup to a seller of a property that the bank will advance the specified sums enabling the buyer to complete the purchase. Revolving Open-End Loans Secured by One- to Four-Family Residential Properties Revolving open-end loans secured by one- to four-family residential properties are essentially home equity lines of credit. A home equity line of credit is a loan secured by a primary residence or second home to the extent of the excess of fair market value over the debt outstanding for the first mortgage. Commercial Real Estate, Construction and Land Development Commercial real estate, construction and land development include unused portions of commitments to extend credit for the purpose of financing commercial and multifamily residential properties as well as land development projects. Both secured-by-real-estate and unsecured commitments are included in this line, as well as undistributed loan proceeds, where there is an obligation to advance for construction progress payments. However, this line only includes those extensions of credit that, once funded, will be classified as Total loans, net on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Credit Card Lines Citigroup provides credit to customers by issuing credit cards. The credit card lines are cancelable by providing notice to the cardholder or without such notice as permitted by local law. Commercial and Other Consumer Loan Commitments Commercial and other consumer loan commitments include overdraft and liquidity facilities as well as commercial commitments to make or purchase loans, purchase third-party receivables, provide note issuance or revolving underwriting facilities and invest in the form of equity. Other Commitments and Contingencies Other commitments and contingencies include all other transactions related to commitments and contingencies not reported on the lines above. Unsettled Reverse Repurchase and Securities Borrowing Agreements and Unsettled Repurchase and Securities Lending Agreements In addition, in the normal course of business, Citigroup enters into reverse repurchase and securities borrowing agreements, as well as repurchase and securities lending agreements, which settle at a future date. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, Citigroup had approximately $ 71.8 billion and $ 34.0 billion in unsettled reverse repurchase and securities borrowing agreements, and $ 62.5 billion and $ 38.7 billion in unsettled repurchase and securities lending agreements, respectively. For a further discussion of securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities borrowed, and securities sold under agreements to repurchase and securities loaned, including the Company’s policy for offsetting repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements, see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 290 27. CONTINGENCIES Accounting and Disclosure Framework ASC 450 governs the disclosure and recognition of loss contingencies, including potential losses from litigation, regulatory, tax and other matters. ASC 450 defines a “loss contingency” as “an existing condition, situation, or set of circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible loss to an entity that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur.” It imposes different requirements for the recognition and disclosure of loss contingencies based on the likelihood of occurrence of the contingent future event or events. It distinguishes among degrees of likelihood using the following three terms: “probable,” meaning that “the future event or events are likely to occur”; “remote,” meaning that “the chance of the future event or events occurring is slight”; and “reasonably possible,” meaning that “the chance of the future event or events occurring is more than remote but less than likely.” These three terms are used below as defined in ASC 450. Accruals . ASC 450 requires accrual for a loss contingency when it is “probable that one or more future events will occur confirming the fact of loss” and “the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.” In accordance with ASC 450, Citigroup establishes accruals for contingencies, including the litigation, regulatory and tax matters disclosed herein, when Citigroup believes it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. When the reasonable estimate of the loss is within a range of amounts, the minimum amount of the range is accrued, unless some higher amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range. Once established, accruals are adjusted from time to time, as appropriate, in light of additional information. The amount of loss ultimately incurred in relation to those matters may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts accrued for those matters. Disclosure . ASC 450 requires disclosure of a loss contingency if “there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss or an additional loss may have been incurred” and there is no accrual for the loss because the conditions described above are not met or an exposure to loss exists in excess of the amount accrued. In accordance with ASC 450, if Citigroup has not accrued for a matter because Citigroup believes that a loss is reasonably possible but not probable, or that a loss is probable but not reasonably estimable, and the reasonably possible loss is material, it discloses the loss contingency. In addition, Citigroup discloses matters for which it has accrued if it believes a reasonably possible exposure to material loss exists in excess of the amount accrued. In accordance with ASC 450, Citigroup’s disclosure includes an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss for those matters as to which an estimate can be made. ASC 450 does not require disclosure of an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss where an estimate cannot be made. Neither accrual nor disclosure is required for losses that are deemed remote. Litigation, Regulatory and Other Contingencies Overview. In addition to the matters described below, in the ordinary course of business, Citigroup, its affiliates and subsidiaries, and current and former officers, directors and employees (for purposes of this section, sometimes collectively referred to as Citigroup and Related Parties) routinely are named as defendants in, or as parties to, various legal actions and proceedings. Certain of these actions and proceedings assert claims or seek relief in connection with alleged violations of consumer protection, fair lending, securities, banking, antifraud, antitrust, anti-money laundering, employment and other statutory and common laws. Certain of these actual or threatened legal actions and proceedings include claims for substantial or indeterminate compensatory or punitive damages, or for injunctive relief, and in some instances seek recovery on a class-wide basis. In the ordinary course of business, Citigroup and Related Parties also are subject to governmental and regulatory examinations, information-gathering requests, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal), certain of which may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, restitution, disgorgement, injunctions or other relief. In addition, certain affiliates and subsidiaries of Citigroup are banks, registered broker-dealers, futures commission merchants, investment advisors or other regulated entities and, in those capacities, are subject to regulation by various U.S., state and foreign securities, banking, commodity futures, consumer protection and other regulators. In connection with formal and informal inquiries by these regulators, Citigroup and such affiliates and subsidiaries receive numerous requests, subpoenas and orders seeking documents, testimony and other information in connection with various aspects of their regulated activities. From time to time Citigroup and Related Parties also receive grand jury subpoenas and other requests for information or assistance, formal or informal, from federal or state law enforcement agencies including, among others, various United States Attorneys’ Offices, the Asset Forfeiture and Money Laundering Section and other divisions of the Department of Justice, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the United States Department of the Treasury, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation relating to Citigroup and its customers. Because of the global scope of Citigroup’s operations, and its presence in countries around the world, Citigroup and Related Parties are subject to litigation and governmental and regulatory examinations, information-gathering requests, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) in multiple jurisdictions with legal, regulatory and tax regimes that may differ substantially, and present substantially different risks, from those Citigroup and Related Parties are subject to in the United States. In some instances, Citigroup and Related Parties may be involved in proceedings involving the same subject matter in multiple jurisdictions, which may result in overlapping, cumulative or inconsistent outcomes. Citigroup seeks to resolve all litigation, regulatory, tax and other matters in the manner management believes is in the best interests of Citigroup and its shareholders, and contests liability, allegations of wrongdoing and, where applicable, the amount of damages or scope of any penalties or other relief sought as appropriate in each pending matter. 291 Inherent Uncertainty of the Matters Disclosed. Certain of the matters disclosed below involve claims for substantial or indeterminate damages. The claims asserted in these matters typically are broad, often spanning a multiyear period and sometimes a wide range of business activities, and the plaintiffs’ or claimants’ alleged damages frequently are not quantified or factually supported in the complaint or statement of claim. Other matters relate to regulatory investigations or proceedings, as to which there may be no objective basis for quantifying the range of potential fine, penalty or other remedy. As a result, Citigroup is often unable to estimate the loss in such matters, even if it believes that a loss is probable or reasonably possible, until developments in the case, proceeding or investigation have yielded additional information sufficient to support a quantitative assessment of the range of reasonably possible loss. Such developments may include, among other things, discovery from adverse parties or third parties, rulings by the court on key issues, analysis by retained experts and engagement in settlement negotiations. Depending on a range of factors, such as the complexity of the facts, the novelty of the legal theories, the pace of discovery, the court’s scheduling order, the timing of court decisions and the adverse party’s, regulator’s or other authority’s willingness to negotiate in good faith toward a resolution, it may be months or years after the filing of a case or commencement of a proceeding or an investigation before an estimate of the range of reasonably possible loss can be made. Matters as to Which an Estimate Can Be Made . For some of the matters disclosed below, Citigroup is currently able to estimate a reasonably possible loss or range of loss in excess of amounts accrued (if any). For some of the matters included within this estimation, an accrual has been made because a loss is believed to be both probable and reasonably estimable, but an exposure to loss exists in excess of the amount accrued. In these cases, the estimate reflects the reasonably possible range of loss in excess of the accrued amount. For other matters included within this estimation, no accrual has been made because a loss, although estimable, is believed to be reasonably possible, but not probable; in these cases, the estimate reflects the reasonably possible loss or range of loss. As of December 31, 2020, Citigroup estimates that the reasonably possible unaccrued loss for these matters ranges up to approximately $ 1.4 billion in the aggregate. These estimates are based on currently available information. As available information changes, the matters for which Citigroup is able to estimate will change, and the estimates themselves will change. In addition, while many estimates presented in financial statements and other financial disclosures involve significant judgment and may be subject to significant uncertainty, estimates of the range of reasonably possible loss arising from litigation, regulatory and tax proceedings are subject to particular uncertainties. For example, at the time of making an estimate, (i) Citigroup may have only preliminary, incomplete, or inaccurate information about the facts underlying the claim, (ii) its assumptions about the future rulings of the court, other tribunal or authority on significant issues, or the behavior and incentives of adverse parties, regulators or other authorities, may prove to be wrong and (iii) the outcomes it is attempting to predict are often not amenable to the use of statistical or other quantitative analytical tools. In addition, from time to time an outcome may occur that Citigroup had not accounted for in its estimate because it had deemed such an outcome to be remote. For all of these reasons, the amount of loss in excess of accruals ultimately incurred for the matters as to which an estimate has been made could be substantially higher or lower than the range of loss included in the estimate. Matters as to Which an Estimate Cannot Be Made . For other matters disclosed below, Citigroup is not currently able to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss. Many of these matters remain in very preliminary stages (even in some cases where a substantial period of time has passed since the commencement of the matter), with few or no substantive legal decisions by the court, tribunal or other authority defining the scope of the claims, the class (if any) or the potentially available damages or other exposure, and fact discovery is still in progress or has not yet begun. In many of these matters, Citigroup has not yet answered the complaint or statement of claim or asserted its defenses, nor has it engaged in any negotiations with the adverse party (whether a regulator, taxing authority or a private party). For all these reasons, Citigroup cannot at this time estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss, if any, for these matters. Opinion of Management as to Eventual Outcome. Subject to the foregoing, it is the opinion of Citigroup’s management, based on current knowledge and after taking into account its current legal or other accruals, that the eventual outcome of all matters described in this Note would not likely have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition of Citigroup. Nonetheless, given the substantial or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these matters, and the inherent unpredictability of such matters, an adverse outcome in certain of these matters could, from time to time, have a material adverse effect on Citigroup’s consolidated results of operations or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods. ANZ Underwriting Matter In 2018, the Australian Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (CDPP) filed charges against Citigroup Global Markets Australia Pty Limited (CGMA) for alleged criminal cartel offenses following a referral by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. CDPP alleges that the cartel conduct took place following an institutional share placement by Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited (ANZ) in August 2015, where CGMA acted as joint underwriter and lead manager with other banks. CDPP also charged other banks and individuals, including current and former Citi employees. Separately, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission is conducting an investigation, and CGMA is cooperating with the investigation. Charges relating to CGMA are captioned R v. CITIGROUP GLOBAL MARKETS AUSTRALIA PTY LIMITED. The matter is before the Federal Court in New South Wales, Australia. Additional information concerning this action is publicly available in court filings under the docket number NSD 1316 - NSD 1324/2020. 292 Facilitation Trading Matters Regulatory agencies in Asia Pacific countries and elsewhere are conducting investigations or making inquiries regarding Citigroup affiliates’ equity sales trading desks in connection with facilitation trades, which are securities transactions in which Citigroup trades fully or partially as principal. Citigroup is cooperating with these investigations and inquiries. Foreign Exchange Matters Regulatory Actions : Government and regulatory agencies in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions are conducting investigations or making inquiries regarding Citigroup’s foreign exchange business. Citigroup is cooperating with these and related investigations and inquiries.

BANK OF AMERICA CORP., ET AL., in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Plaintiffs allege that defendants engaged in a conspiracy to fix currency prices. Plaintiffs assert claims under the Sherman Act and various state antitrust laws, and seek compensatory damages and treble damages. On November 19, 2020, the court granted final approval of a settlement between plaintiffs and Citigroup, Citibank, Citicorp and CGMI. Additional information concerning this action is publicly available in court filings under the docket number 17 Civ. 3139 (S.D.N.Y.) (Schofield, J.). In 2019, an application, captioned MICHAEL O’HIGGINS FX CLASS REPRESENTATIVE LIMITED v. BARCLAYS BANK PLC AND OTHERS, was made to the U.K.’s Competition Appeal Tribunal requesting permission to commence collective proceedings against Citigroup, Citibank and other defendants.

CITIGROUP INC., ET AL., in the Commercial Court of Aubenas in France. Plaintiff alleges that defendants suppressed LIBOR submissions between 2005 and 2012 and that Banque Delubac’s EURIBOR-linked lending activity was negatively impacted as a result. Plaintiff asserts a claim under tort law, and seeks compensatory damages and consequential damages. In November 2018, the Commercial Court of Aubenas referred the case to the Commercial Court of Marseille. In March 2019, the Court of Appeal of Nîmes held that neither the Commercial Court of Aubenas nor any other court of France has territorial jurisdiction over Banque Delubac’s claims. In May 2019, plaintiff filed an appeal before the Cour de cassation of France challenging the Court of Appeal of Nîmes’s decision. Additional information concerning this action is publicly available in court filings under docket numbers RG no. 2018F02750 in the Commercial Court of Marseille and 19-16.931 in the Cour de cassation . In May 2019, three putative class actions filed against Citigroup, Citibank, CGMI and other defendants were consolidated, under the caption IN RE ICE LIBOR ANTITRUST LITIGATION, in the United States District Court of the Southern District of New York. In July 2019, plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint. Plaintiffs allege that defendants suppressed ICE LIBOR. Plaintiffs assert claims under the Sherman Act, the Clayton Act, and unjust enrichment, and seek compensatory damages, disgorgement, and treble damages. In March 2020, the court granted defendants’ motion to dismiss the action for failure to state a claim, which plaintiffs appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. On December 28, 2020, DYJ Holdings, LLC filed a motion to intervene as a plaintiff, given that the existing plaintiffs intended to withdraw from the case, which defendants opposed and separately moved to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Additional information concerning this action is publicly available in court filings under the docket numbers 19 Civ. 439 (S.D.N.Y.) (Daniels, J.) and 20-1492 (2d Cir.).

On November 11, 2020, defendants filed a motion to transfer the case to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Additional information concerning this action is publicly available in court filings under the docket number 20 Civ. 5832 (N.D. Cal.) (Donato, J.). Interchange Fee Litigation Beginning in 2005, several putative class actions were filed against Citigroup, Citibank, and Citicorp, together with Visa, MasterCard, and other banks and their affiliates, in various federal district courts and consolidated with other related individual cases in a multi-district litigation proceeding in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. This proceeding is captioned IN RE PAYMENT CARD INTERCHANGE FEE AND MERCHANT DISCOUNT ANTITRUST LITIGATION. The plaintiffs, merchants that accept Visa and MasterCard branded payment cards, as well as various membership associations that claim to represent certain groups of merchants, allege, among other things, that defendants have engaged in conspiracies to set the price of interchange and merchant discount fees on credit and debit card transactions and to restrain trade unreasonably through various Visa and MasterCard rules governing merchant conduct, all in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act and certain California statutes. Plaintiffs further alleged violations of Section 2 of the Sherman Act. Supplemental complaints also were filed against defendants in the putative class actions alleging that Visa’s and MasterCard’s respective initial public offerings were anticompetitive and violated Section 7 of the Clayton Act, and that MasterCard’s initial public offering constituted a fraudulent conveyance. In 2014, the district court entered a final judgment approving the terms of a class settlement. Various objectors appealed from the final class settlement approval order to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. 294 In 2016, the Court of Appeals reversed the district court’s approval of the class settlement and remanded for further proceedings. The district court thereafter appointed separate interim counsel for a putative class seeking damages and a putative class seeking injunctive relief. Amended or new complaints on behalf of the putative classes and various individual merchants were subsequently filed, including a further amended complaint on behalf of a putative damages class and a new complaint on behalf of a putative injunctive class, both of which named Citigroup and Related Parties. In addition, numerous merchants have filed amended or new complaints against Visa, MasterCard, and in some instances one or more issuing banks, including Citigroup and affiliates. In 2019, the district court granted the damages class plaintiffs’ motion for final approval of a new settlement with the defendants. The settlement involves the damages class only and does not settle the claims of the injunctive relief class or any actions brought on a non-class basis by individual merchants. The settlement provides for a cash payment to the damages class of $ 6.24 billion, later reduced by $ 700 million based on the transaction volume of class members that opted-out from the settlement. Several merchants and merchant groups have appealed the final approval order. Additional information concerning these consolidated actions is publicly available in court filings under the docket number MDL 05-1720 (E.D.N.Y.) (Brodie, J.). Interest Rate and Credit Default Swap Matters Regulatory Actions : The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is conducting an investigation into alleged anticompetitive conduct in the trading and clearing of interest rate swaps (IRS) by investment banks. Citigroup is cooperating with the investigation. Antitrust and Other Litigation : Beginning in 2015, Citigroup, Citibank, CGMI, CGML, and numerous other parties were named as defendants in a number of industry-wide putative class actions related to IRS trading. These actions have been consolidated in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York under the caption IN RE INTEREST RATE SWAPS ANTITRUST LITIGATION. The actions allege that defendants colluded to prevent the development of exchange-like trading for IRS and assert federal and state antitrust claims and claims for unjust enrichment. Also consolidated under the same caption are individual actions filed by swap execution facilities, asserting federal and state antitrust claims, as well as claims for unjust enrichment and tortious interference with business relations. Plaintiffs in all of these actions seek treble damages, fees, costs, and injunctive relief. Lead plaintiffs in the class action moved for class certification in 2019, and subsequently filed an amended complaint. Additional information concerning these actions is publicly available in court filings under the docket numbers 18-CV-5361 (S.D.N.Y.) (Oetken, J.) and 16-MD-2704 (S.D.N.Y.) (Oetken, J.). In 2017, Citigroup, Citibank, CGMI, CGML and numerous other parties were named as defendants in an action filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York under the caption TERA GROUP, INC., ET AL. v.

Additional information concerning this action is publicly available in court filings under the docket number 17-CV-4302 (S.D.N.Y.) (Sullivan, J.). Parmalat Litigation In 2004, an Italian commissioner appointed to oversee the administration of various Parmalat companies filed a complaint against Citigroup, Citibank, and related parties, alleging that the defendants facilitated a number of frauds by Parmalat insiders. In 2008, a jury rendered a verdict in Citigroup’s favor and awarded Citi $ 431 million. In 2019, the Italian Supreme Court affirmed the decision in the full amount of $ 431 million. Citigroup has taken steps to enforce the judgment in Italian and Belgian courts. Additional information concerning these actions is publicly available in court filings under the docket numbers 27618/2014, 4133/2019, and 22098/2019 (Italy), and 20/3617/A and 20/4007/A (Brussels). In 2015, Parmalat filed a claim in an Italian civil court in Milan claiming damages of € 1.8 billion against Citigroup, Citibank, and related parties. The Milan court dismissed Parmalat’s claim on grounds that it was duplicative of Parmalat’s previously unsuccessful claims. In 2019, the Milan Court of Appeal rejected Parmalat’s appeal of the Milan court’s dismissal. In June 2019, Parmalat filed a further appeal with the Italian Supreme Court. Additional information concerning this action is publicly available in court filings under the docket numbers 1009/2018 and 20598/2019. On January 29, 2020, Parmalat, its three directors, and its sole shareholder, Sofil S.a.s., as co-plaintiffs, filed a claim before the Italian civil court in Milan seeking a declaratory judgment that they do not owe compensatory damages of € 990 million to Citibank. On November 5, 2020, Citibank joined the proceedings, seeking dismissal of the declaratory judgment application. Additional information concerning this action is publicly available in court filings under the docket number 8611/2020. Payment Protection Insurance Regulators and courts in the U.K. have scrutinized the selling of payment protection insurance (PPI) by financial institutions for several years.

REVLON, INC., ET AL. Plaintiff alleged that, with respect to a 2016 credit agreement between Revlon and various lenders for which Citibank served as administrative and collateral agent, the defendants deprived lenders of the collateral securing loans they made to Revlon under the credit agreement. On November 8, 2020, plaintiffs withdrew the case 295 without prejudice.

Transaction Tax Matters Citigroup and Citibank are engaged in litigation or examinations with non-U.S. tax authorities, including in the U.K., India, and Germany, concerning the payment of transaction taxes and other non-income tax matters. Tribune Company Bankruptcy Certain Citigroup affiliates (along with numerous other parties) have been named as defendants in adversary proceedings related to the Chapter 11 cases of Tribune Company (Tribune) filed in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, asserting claims arising out of the approximately $ 11 billion leveraged buyout of Tribune in 2007. The actions were consolidated as IN RE TRIBUNE COMPANY FRAUDULENT CONVEYANCE LITIGATION and transferred to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. In the adversary proceeding captioned KIRSCHNER v. FITZSIMONS, ET AL., the litigation trustee, as successor plaintiff to the unsecured creditors committee, seeks to avoid and recover as actual fraudulent transfers the transfers of Tribune stock that occurred as a part of the leveraged buyout. Several Citigroup affiliates, along with numerous other parties, were named as shareholder defendants and were alleged to have tendered Tribune stock to Tribune as a part of the buyout. In 2017, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York dismissed the actual fraudulent transfer claim against the shareholder defendants, including the Citigroup affiliates. In 2019, the litigation trustee filed an appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Several Citigroup affiliates, along with numerous other parties, are named as defendants in certain actions brought by Tribune noteholders, which seek to recover the transfers of Tribune stock that occurred as a part of the leveraged buyout, as state-law constructive fraudulent conveyances. The noteholders’ claims were previously dismissed and the dismissal was affirmed on appeal. In 2018, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit withdrew its 2016 transfer of jurisdiction to the district court to reconsider its decision in light of a recent United States Supreme Court decision. In 2019, the Court of Appeals issued an amended decision again affirming the dismissal. In January 2020, the noteholders filed a petition for rehearing. On July 6, 2020, the noteholders filed a petition for a writ of certiorari in the United States Supreme Court. On October 5, 2020, the Supreme 297 Court called for the views of the Acting Solicitor General on whether the petition should be granted. CGMI was named as a defendant in a separate action, KIRSCHNER v. CGMI, in connection with its role as advisor to Tribune. In 2019, the court dismissed the action, which the litigation trustee has appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Additional information concerning these actions is publicly available in court filings under the docket numbers 08-13141 (Bankr. D. Del.) (Carey, J.), 11 MD 02296 (S.D.N.Y.)

BANK OF AMERICA CORP., ET AL. filed a consolidated complaint naming as defendants Citigroup, Citibank, CGMI, CGML and numerous other industry participants. The consolidated complaint asserts violations of the Sherman Act, as well as claims for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, and unjust enrichment, and seeks damages and injunctive relief based on allegations that defendants served as remarketing agents for municipal bonds called variable rate demand obligations (VRDOs) and colluded to set artificially high VRDO interest rates. On November 6, 2020, the court granted in part and denied in part defendants’ motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint. Additional information concerning this action is publicly available in court filings under the docket numbers 19-CV-1608 (S.D.N.Y.) (Furman, J.) and 19-CV-2667 (S.D.N.Y.) (Furman, J.).

SUBSEQUENT EVENT As a result of new information Citi received subsequent to December 31, 2020, Citi adjusted downward its 2020 financial results (recognized in the fourth quarter of 2020) from those previously reported on January 15, 2021, due to a $ 390 million increase in operating expenses ($ 323 million after-tax) recorded within ICG , resulting from operational losses related to certain legal matters. Citi’s results of operations and financial condition for the full year 2020, as reported in this Annual Report on Form 10‐K for the year ended December 31, 2020, reflect the impact of this adjustment. 309 30.

(1)     As a result of new information Citi received subsequent to December 31, 2020, Citi adjusted downward its fourth quarter of 2020 financial results from those previously reported on January 15, 2021, due to a $ 390 million increase in operating expenses ($ 323 million after‐tax) recorded within ICG , resulting from operational losses related to certain legal matters. The downward adjustment lowered Citigroup’s fourth quarter net income from $ 4.6 billion to $ 4.3 billion and earnings per diluted share from $ 2.08 to $ 1.92 . (2)    In the fourth quarter of 2020, Citi revised the second quarter accounting conclusion for its variable post-charge-off third-party collection costs from a “change in accounting estimate effected by a change in accounting principle” to a “change in accounting principle,” which requires an adjustment to January 1, 2020 opening retained earnings, rather than net income. As a result, Citi’s full-year and quarterly results for 2020 have been revised to reflect this change as if it were effective as of January 1, 2020. Citi recorded an increase to its beginning retained earnings on January 1, 2020 of $ 330 million and a decrease of $ 443 million in its allowance for credit losses on loans, as well as a $ 113 million increase in other assets related to income taxes, and recorded a decrease of $ 18 million to its provisions for credit losses on loans in the first quarter and increases of $ 339 million and $ 122 million to its provisions for credit losses on loans in the second and third quarters, respectively. In addition, Citi’s operating expenses increased by $ 49 million and $ 45 million with a corresponding decrease in net credit losses, in the first and second quarters, respectively. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. (3)    The fourth quarter of 2019 includes discrete tax items of roughly $ 540 million including an approximate $ 430 million benefit of a reduction in Citi’s valuation allowance related to its DTAs. The third quarter of 2019 includes discrete tax items of roughly $ 230 million, including an approximate $ 180 million benefit of a reduction in Citi’s valuation allowance related to its DTAs. (4)    Certain securities were excluded from the second quarter of 2020 diluted EPS calculation because they were anti-dilutive. Year-to-date EPS will not equal the sum of the individual quarters because the year-to-date EPS calculation is a separate calculation. In addition, due to averaging of shares, quarterly earnings per share may not sum to the totals reported for the full year.

General Citigroup is a registered bank holding company and financial holding company and is regulated and supervised by the Federal Reserve Board. Citigroup’s nationally chartered subsidiary banks, including Citibank, are regulated and supervised by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) also has examination authority for banking subsidiaries whose deposits it insures. Overseas branches of Citibank are regulated and supervised by the Federal Reserve Board and OCC and overseas subsidiary banks by the Federal Reserve Board. These overseas branches and subsidiary banks are also regulated and supervised by regulatory authorities in the host countries. In addition, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) regulates consumer financial products and services. Citi is also subject to laws and regulations concerning the collection, use, sharing and disposition of certain customer, employee and other personal and confidential information, including those imposed by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act and the EU General Data Protection Regulation. For more information on U.S. and foreign regulation affecting or potentially affecting Citi, see “Managing Global Risk—Capital Resources” and “–Liquidity Risk” and “Risk Factors” above. Other Bank and Bank Holding Company Regulation Citi, including its banking subsidiaries, is subject to regulatory limitations, including requirements for banks to maintain reserves against deposits, requirements as to liquidity, risk-based capital and leverage (see “Capital Resources” above and Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), restrictions on the types and amounts of loans that may be made and the interest that may be charged, and limitations on investments that can be made and services that can be offered. The Federal Reserve Board may also expect Citi to commit resources to its subsidiary banks in certain circumstances. Citi is also subject to anti-money laundering and financial transparency laws, including standards for verifying client identification at account opening and obligations to monitor client transactions and report suspicious activities. Securities and Commodities Regulation Citi conducts securities underwriting, brokerage and dealing activities in the U.S. through Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (CGMI), its primary broker-dealer, and other broker-dealer subsidiaries, which are subject to regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and certain exchanges. Citi conducts similar securities activities outside the U.S., subject to local requirements, through various subsidiaries and affiliates, principally Citigroup Global Markets Limited in London (CGML), which is regulated principally by the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), and Citigroup Global Markets Japan Inc. in Tokyo, which is regulated principally by the Financial Services Agency of Japan. Citi also has subsidiaries that are members of futures exchanges and derivatives clearinghouses. In the U.S., CGMI is a member of the principal U.S. futures exchanges and clearinghouses, and Citi has subsidiaries that are registered as futures commission merchants and commodity pool operators with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Citibank, CGMI, Citigroup Energy Inc., Citigroup Global Markets Europe AG and CGML are also registered as swap dealers with the CFTC, and other Citi subsidiaries are registered with the CFTC as commodity pool operators. CGMI is also subject to SEC and CFTC rules that specify uniform minimum net capital requirements. Compliance with these rules could limit those operations of CGMI that require the intensive use of capital and also limits the ability of broker-dealers to transfer large amounts of capital to parent companies and other affiliates. See “Capital Resources” and Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of capital considerations of Citi’s non-banking subsidiaries. Transactions with Affiliates Transactions between Citi’s U.S. subsidiary depository institutions and their non-bank affiliates are regulated by the Federal Reserve Board, and are generally required to be on arm’s-length terms. See “Managing Global Risk—Liquidity Risk” above. COMPETITION The financial services industry is highly competitive. Citi’s competitors include a variety of financial services and advisory companies. Citi competes for clients and capital (including deposits and funding in the short- and long-term debt markets) with some of these competitors globally and with others on a regional or product basis. Citi’s competitive position depends on many factors, including, among others, the value of Citi’s brand name, reputation, the types of clients and geographies served; the quality, range, performance, innovation and pricing of products and services; the effectiveness of and access to distribution channels, technology advances, customer service and convenience; the effectiveness of transaction execution, interest rates and lending limits; and regulatory constraints. Citi’s ability to compete effectively also depends upon its ability to attract new colleagues and retain and motivate existing colleagues, while managing compensation and other costs. For additional information on competitive factors and uncertainties impacting Citi’s businesses, see “Risk Factors—Strategic Risks” above. 312 DISCLOSURE PURSUANT TO SECTION 219 OF THE IRAN THREAT REDUCTION AND SYRIA HUMAN RIGHTS ACT Pursuant to Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 (Section 219), which added Section 13(r) to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, Citi is required to disclose in its annual or quarterly reports, as applicable, whether it or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities, transactions or dealings relating to Iran or with certain individuals or entities that are the subject of sanctions under U.S. law. Disclosure is generally required even where the activities, transactions or dealings were conducted in compliance with applicable law. Citi, in its related quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, previously disclosed no reportable activities for the first and third quarters of 2020 and reportable activities pursuant to Section 219 for the second quarter of 2020. Citi had no reportable activities pursuant to Section 219 for the fourth quarter of 2020. 313 UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES, REPURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND DIVIDENDS Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities None. Equity Security Repurchases As previously announced, on March 15, 2020, Citi joined other major U.S. banks in suspending share repurchases in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, based on measures announced by the Federal Reserve Board throughout 2020, share repurchases were prohibited through the end of the fourth quarter of 2020. Accordingly, Citi did not have any share repurchases in the fourth quarter of 2020, other than permitted repurchases relating to issuances of common stock related to employee stock ownership plans. During the fourth quarter, pursuant to Citigroup’s Board of Directors’ authorization, Citi repurchased 50,588 shares (at an average price of $54.59) of common stock, added to treasury stock, related to activity on employee stock programs where shares were withheld to satisfy the employee tax requirements. Based on measures announced by the Federal Reserve Board in December 2020, share repurchases will be permitted during the first quarter of 2021, subject to limitations based on net income for the four preceding calendar quarters, in addition to the previously announced common dividends paid during the first quarter of 2021. These limitations on capital distributions may be extended by the Federal Reserve Board. Under these modified limitations on capital distributions, Citi is authorized to return capital to common shareholders of up to $2.8 billion, during the first quarter of 2021, including the previously announced common dividends of $0.51 per share in the quarter. Citi commenced share repurchases in February 2021. For additional information on these capital distribution limitations, see “Capital Resources—Capital Plan Resubmission and Related Limitations on Capital Distributions” above. Dividends Consistent with the regulatory capital framework, Citi paid common dividends of $0.51 per share for the fourth quarter of 2020 and the first quarter of 2021, and intends to maintain its planned capital actions, which include common dividends of $0.51 per share through the second and third quarter of 2021 (the remaining quarters of the 2020 CCAR cycle), subject to approval of Citi’s Board of Directors and the latest financial and macroeconomic conditions. In addition to Board of Directors’ approval, Citi’s ability to pay common stock dividends substantially depends on the results of the CCAR process required by the Federal Reserve Board and the supervisory stress tests required under the Dodd-Frank Act. For additional information regarding Citi’s capital planning and stress testing, see “Capital Resources—Stress Testing Component of Capital Planning” and “Risk Factors—Strategic Risks” above. Through the end of the first quarter of 2021, dividends continue to be capped and tied to a formula based on recent income. These limitations on capital distributions may be extended by the Federal Reserve Board. For additional information on these capital distribution limitations, see “Capital Resources—Capital Plan Resubmission and Related Limitations on Capital Distributions” above. Any dividend on Citi’s outstanding common stock would also need to be made in compliance with Citi’s obligations on its outstanding preferred stock. For information on the ability of Citigroup’s subsidiary depository institutions to pay dividends, see Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 314 PERFORMANCE GRAPH Comparison of Five-Year Cumulative Total Return The following graph and table compare the cumulative total return on Citi’s common stock with the cumulative total return of the S&P 500 Index and the S&P Financials Index over the five-year period through December 31, 2020.
