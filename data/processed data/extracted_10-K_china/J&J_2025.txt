The decline of STELARA (ustekinumab) sales was driven by share loss primarily due to European biosimilar entrants. Lower sales of REMICADE (infliximab) was due to continued biosimilar competition. The growth of TREMFYA (guselkumab) was due to market growth and share gains. Sales of STELARA in the United States were approximately $6.7 billion in fiscal 2024. Third parties have filed abbreviated Biologics License Applications with the FDA seeking approval to market biosimilar versions of STELARA. The Company has settled certain litigation under the Biosimilar Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009. According to patent settlement and license agreements, the Company expects continued launches of biosimilar versions of STELARA in Europe and the United States in 2025 which will impact the Company’s sales of STELARA. Biosimilar versions of REMICADE have been introduced in the United States and certain markets outside the United States and additional competitors continue to enter the market. Continued infliximab biosimilar competition will result in a further reduction in sales of REMICADE. Infectious disease products sales were $3.4 billion in 2024, a decline of 23.1% as compared to the prior year primarily driven by a decline in COVID-19 vaccine revenue. Neuroscience products sales were $7.1 billion in 2024, representing a decrease of 0.4% as compared to the prior year primarily driven by a decline in Other Neuroscience. The decline was partially offset by the growth of SPRAVATO (esketamine) driven by the ongoing launch and increased physician and patient demand. Oncology products achieved sales of $20.8 billion in 2024, representing an increase of 17.7% as compared to the prior year. Strong sales of DARZALEX (daratumumab) were driven by continued share gains and market growth. Growth of ERLEADA (apalutamide) was primarily due to continued share gains and market growth. Sales of CARVYKTI (ciltacabtagene autoleucel) were driven by continued share gains, capacity expansion and manufacturing efficiencies. Additionally, sales from the ongoing launches of TECVAYLI (teclistamab-cqyv), TALVEY (talquetamab-tgvs) and RYBREVANT (amivantamab), included in Other Oncology, contributed to the growth. Growth was partially offset by ZYTIGA (abiraterone acetate) due to loss of exclusivity and IMBRUVICA (ibrutinib) due to global competitive pressures. Pulmonary Hypertension products sales were $4.3 billion, representing an increase of 12.3% as compared to the prior year. Sales growth of both OPSUMIT (macitentan) and UPTRAVI (selexipag) was driven by market growth and share gains. Growth in Other Pulmonary Hypertension was driven by OPSYNVI (macitentan/tadalafil). Cardiovascular/Metabolism/Other products sales were $3.6 billion, a decline of 3.0% as compared to the prior year driven by declines in Other. The Company maintains a policy that no end customer will be permitted direct delivery of product to a location other than the billing location. This policy impacts contract pharmacy transactions involving non-grantee 340B covered entities for most of the Company’s drugs, subject to multiple exceptions. Both grantee and non-grantee covered entities can maintain certain contract pharmacy arrangements under policy exceptions. The Company has been and will continue to offer 340B discounts to covered entities on all of its covered outpatient drugs, and it believes its policy will improve its ability to identify inappropriate duplicate discounts and diversion prohibited by the 340B statute. The 340B Drug Pricing Program is a U.S. federal government program requiring drug manufacturers to provide significant discounts on covered outpatient drugs to covered entities. 26 During 2024, the Company advanced its pipeline with several regulatory submissions and approvals for new drugs and additional indications for existing drugs as follows: Product Name (Chemical Name) Indication US Approval EU Approval US Filing EU Filing BALVERSA (erdafitinib) Treatment of Patients with Locally Advanced or Metastatic Urothelial Carcinoma and Selected Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor Gene Alterations (THOR) • • CARVYKTI (ciltacabtagene autoleucel) Treatment for Relapsed and Refactor multiple myeloma with 1-3 PL (CARTITUDE-4) • • DARZALEX (daratumumab) Treatment for frontline multiple myeloma transplant eligible (PERSEUS) • • DARZALEX (daratumumab) Treatment for frontline multiple myeloma transplant ineligible (CEPHEUS) • • DARZALEX (daratumumab) Treatment as subcutaneous monotherapy for high-risk smoldering multiple myeloma (AQUILA) • • EDURANT (rilpivirine) Treatment for pediatric patients (2-12 years old) with HIV • • IMBRUVICA (ibrutinib) Treatment for frontline MCL (Triangle) • nipocalimab Treatment for Generalized Myasthenia Gravis • • OPSUMIT (macitentan) Treatment for pediatric pulmonary arterial hypertension (TOMORROW) • • OPSYNVI (macitentan/tadalafil STCT) Treatment for pulmonary arterial hypertension • • REKAMBYS Treatment for Adolescents HIV • RYBREVANT (amivantamab) In Combination with Chemotherapy for the First-Line Treatment of Adult Patients with Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer with Activating EGFR Exon 20 Insertion Mutations (PAPILLON) • • RYBREVANT (amivantamab) Treatment for subcutaneous (PALOMA-3) • • RYBREVANT / LAZCLUZE Treatment for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (MARIPOSA) • • RYBREVANT Treatment for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer 2L (MARIPOSA-2) • • SIMPONI (golimumab) Treatment of Patients with Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis • • SPRAVATO (esketamine) monotherapy Treatment of Patients with Treatment Resistant Depression (TRD4005) • STELARA (ustekinumab) Treatment of Patients with Pediatric Crohn's Disease • TREMFYA (guselkumab) Treatment of Patients with Ulcerative Colitis (QUASAR) • • TREMFYA (guselkumab) Subcutaneous Induction for treatment of patients with Ulcerative Colitis (ASTRO) • TREMFYA (guselkumab) Subcutaneous Induction for treatment of patients with Crohn's Disease (GRAVITI) • • TREMFYA (guselkumab) Treatment of Patients with Crohn's Disease (GALAXI) • • TREMFYA (guselkumab) Treatment of Patients with Pediatric Psoriasis • UPTRAVI (selexipag) Treatment of Patients with Pediatric Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (SALTO) • 2024 Annual Report 27 MedTech segment The MedTech segment sales in 2024 were $31.9 billion, an increase of 4.8% from 2023, which included operational growth of 6.2% and a negative currency impact of 1.4%.

The decline in Advanced Surgery was primarily due to China volume-based procurement across all platforms and competitive pressures in Energy and Endocutters. This was partially offset by the strength of the portfolio and commercial execution in Biosurgery as well as the strength of new products in Endocutters. Growth in General Surgery was primarily driven by technology penetration and benefits from the differentiated Wound Closure portfolio as well as increased procedure volume. This growth was offset by the negative impact of currency and the Acclarent divestiture. The Orthopaedics franchise sales were $9.2 billion in 2024, representing an increase of 2.4% from 2023. The fiscal 2024 includes a one-time revenue recognition timing change related to certain products across all Orthopaedic platforms in the U.S. which positively impacted the worldwide Orthopaedics franchise growth as well as the negative impact from the near-term revenue disruption related to the previously announced Orthopaedics restructuring. The growth in Hips reflects continued strength of the portfolio primarily in the Anterior approach, and global procedure growth. The growth in Knees was primarily driven by the ATTUNE portfolio, pull through related to the VELYS Robotic assisted solution and global procedure growth. Growth in Trauma was driven by the adoption of recently launched products. The decline in Spine, Sports & Other was primarily driven by competitive pressures and impacts from China volume-based procurement. This was partially offset by growth in the U.S. market. 28 The Cardiovascular franchise, which includes sales from Shockwave Medical (Shockwave) acquired on May 31, 2024, achieved sales of $7.7 billion in 2024, representing an increase of 21.4% from 2023. Electrophysiology growth was driven by global procedure growth, new product performance and commercial execution. This was partially offset by the impacts of volume-based procurement in China and competitive pressures in Pulsed Field Ablation catheters in the U.S. Abiomed sales reflect the strength of all major commercialized regions driven by the continued adoption of Impella 5.5 and Impella RP. The Vision franchise achieved sales of $5.1 billion in 2024, representing an increase of 1.5% from 2023. Contact Lenses/Other growth was primarily driven by price actions, continued strong performance in the ACUVUE OASYS 1-Day family of products (including recent launches), impacts from a one-time change in contract shipping terms in the U.S. and lapping of prior year impacts of Russian sanctions partially offset by U.S. distributor stocking dynamics. Surgical growth was primarily driven by the continued strength of recent innovations and commercial execution partially offset by China volume-based procurement and competitive pressures in the U.S. Analysis of consolidated earnings before provision for taxes on income Consolidated earnings before provision for taxes on income was $16.7 billion and $15.1 billion for the years 2024 and 2023, respectively.

On December 15, 2022, the European Union (EU) Member States formally adopted the EU’s Pillar Two Directive, which generally provides for a minimum effective tax rate of 15%, as established by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Pillar Two Framework that was supported by over 130 countries worldwide. Several EU and non-EU countries have enacted Pillar Two legislation with an initial effective date of January 1, 2024, with other aspects of the law effective in 2025 or later. In the fiscal year 2024, the net impact of Pillar Two legislation was less than 1.0% to the Company’s effective tax rate. While countries continue to enact new provisions or issue new regulations, based on current guidance, the Company expects the net impact of Pillar Two in fiscal year 2025 to be up to 1.0% to the Company’s effective tax rate.

As of December 29, 2024, the net debt position was $12.1 billion as compared to the prior year of $6.4 billion. The debt balance at the end of 2024 was $36.6 billion as compared to $29.3 billion in 2023. In the fiscal second quarter of 2024, the Company issued senior unsecured notes for a total of $6.7 billion. For additional details on borrowings, see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The net proceeds from this offering were used to fund the Shockwave acquisition which closed on May 31, 2024, and for general corporate purposes. Considering recent market conditions, the Company has re-evaluated its operating cash flows and liquidity profile and does not foresee any significant incremental risk. The Company anticipates that operating cash flows, the ability to raise funds from external sources, borrowing capacity from existing committed credit facilities and access to the commercial paper markets will continue to provide sufficient resources to fund operating needs, including the Company's remaining balance to be paid on the agreement to settle opioid litigation for approximately $1.5 billion and the approximately $11.6 billion ($13.5 billion nominal) reserve for talc matters (See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details). In addition, the Company monitors the global capital markets on an ongoing basis and from time to time may raise capital when market conditions are favorable. On May 8, 2023, Kenvue, completed an initial public offering (the IPO) resulting in the issuance of 198,734,444 shares of its common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the Kenvue Common Stock), at an initial public offering of $22.00 per share for net proceeds of $4.2 billion. The excess of the net proceeds from the IPO over the net book value of the Johnson & Johnson 34 divested interest was $2.5 billion and was recorded to additional paid-in capital. As of the closing of the IPO, Johnson & Johnson owned approximately 89.6% of the total outstanding shares of Kenvue Common Stock and at July 2, 2023, the non-controlling interest of $1.3 billion associated with Kenvue was reflected in equity attributable to non-controlling interests in the consolidated balance sheet. On August 23, 2023, Johnson & Johnson completed the disposition of an additional 80.1% ownership of Kenvue Common Stock through an exchange offer, which resulted in Johnson & Johnson acquiring 190,955,436 shares of the Company’s common stock in exchange for 1,533,830,450 shares of Kenvue Common Stock. The $31.4 billion of Johnson & Johnson common stock received in the exchange offer is recorded in Treasury stock. Following the exchange offer, the Company owned 9.5% of the total outstanding shares of Kenvue Common Stock that was recorded in other assets within continuing operations at the fair market value of $4.3 billion as of August 23, 2023 and $3.9 billion as of December 31, 2023. Johnson & Johnson divested net assets of $11.6 billion as of August 23, 2023, and the accumulated other comprehensive loss attributable to the Consumer Health business at that date was $4.3 billion. Additionally, at the date of the exchange offer, Johnson & Johnson decreased the non-controlling interest by $1.2 billion to record the deconsolidation of Kenvue. This resulted in a gain on the exchange offer of $21.0 billion that was recorded in Net earnings from discontinued operations, net of taxes in the consolidated statements of earnings for the fiscal third quarter of 2023. This one-time gain includes a gain of $2.8 billion on the Kenvue Common Stock retained by Johnson & Johnson. The gain on the exchange offer qualifies as a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. On May 15, 2024, the Company issued $3.6 billion aggregate principal amount of commercial paper and received $3.6 billion of net cash proceeds to be used for general corporate purposes. On May 17, 2024, the Company completed a Debt-for-Equity Exchange of its remaining 182,329,550 shares of Kenvue Common Stock for the outstanding Commercial Paper. Upon completion of the Debt-for-Equity Exchange, the Commercial Paper was satisfied and discharged and the Company no longer owns any shares of Kenvue Common Stock. This exchange resulted in a loss of approximately $0.4 billion recorded in Other (income) expense. The following table summarizes the Company’s material contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as of December 29, 2024: To satisfy these obligations, the Company intends to use cash from operations.

For the proposed talc settlement payments, see Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 2024 Annual Report 35 Financing and market risk The Company uses financial instruments to manage the impact of foreign exchange rate changes on cash flows. Accordingly, the Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to protect the value of certain foreign currency assets and liabilities and to hedge future foreign currency transactions primarily related to product costs. Gains or losses on these contracts are offset by the gains or losses on the underlying transactions. A 10% appreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the December 29, 2024 market rates would increase the unrealized value of the Company’s forward contracts by $0.2 billion. Conversely, a 10% depreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the December 29, 2024 market rates would decrease the unrealized value of the Company’s forward contracts by $0.2 billion. In either scenario, the gain or loss on the forward contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction, and therefore, would have no impact on future anticipated earnings and cash flows. The Company hedges the exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and the effect on certain assets and liabilities in foreign currency, by entering into currency swap contracts. A 1% change in the spread between U.S. and foreign interest rates on the Company’s interest rate sensitive financial instruments would either increase or decrease the unrealized value of the Company’s swap contracts by approximately $1.5 billion. In either scenario, at maturity, the gain or loss on the swap contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction, and therefore, would have no impact on future anticipated cash flows. The Company does not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Further, the Company has a policy of only entering into contracts with parties that have at least an investment grade credit rating. The counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions and there is no significant concentration of exposure with any one counterparty. Management believes the risk of loss is remote. The Company entered into credit support agreements (CSA) with certain derivative counterparties establishing collateral thresholds based on respective credit ratings and netting agreements. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on credit support agreements. The Company invests in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities which carry a degree of interest rate risk. The fair market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall. A 1% (100 basis points) change in spread on the Company’s interest rate sensitive investments would either increase or decrease the unrealized value of cash equivalents and current marketable securities by less than $8.0 million. The Company has access to substantial sources of funds at numerous banks worldwide. In June 2024, the Company secured a new 364-day Credit Facility of $10 billion, which expires on June 25, 2025. Interest charged on borrowings under the credit line agreement is based on either Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) Reference Rate or other applicable market rate as allowed plus applicable margins. Commitment fees under the agreement are not material. Total borrowings at the end of 2024 and 2023 were $36.6 billion and $29.3 billion, respectively. The increase in the borrowings was due to the issuance of new debt in 2024. In 2024, net debt (cash and current marketable securities, net of debt) was $12.1 billion compared to net debt of $6.4 billion in 2023. Total debt represented 34.0% of total capital (shareholders’ equity and total debt) in 2024 and 30.0% of total capital in 2023. Shareholders’ equity per share at the end of 2024 was $29.70 compared to $28.57 at year-end 2023. A summary of borrowings can be found in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Dividends The Company increased its dividend in 2024 for the 62 nd consecutive year. Cash dividends paid were $4.91 per share in 2024 and $4.70 per share in 2023. On January 2, 2025, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $1.24 per share, payable on March 4, 2025 to shareholders of record as of February 18, 2025. 36 Other information Critical accounting policies and estimates
