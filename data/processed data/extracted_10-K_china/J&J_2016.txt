MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION Organization and Business Segments Description of the Company and Business Segments Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) have approximately 127,100 employees worldwide engaged in the research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the health care field. The Company conducts business in virtually all countries of the world with the primary focus on products related to human health and well-being. The Company is organized into three business segments: Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices. The Consumer segment includes a broad range of products used in the baby care, oral care, skin care, over-the-counter pharmaceutical, women’s health and wound care markets. These products are marketed to the general public and sold both to retail outlets and distributors throughout the world. The Pharmaceutical segment is focused on five therapeutic areas, including immunology, infectious diseases, neuroscience, oncology, and cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Products in this segment are distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers, hospitals and health care professionals for prescription use. The Medical Devices segment includes a broad range of products used in the orthopaedic, surgery, cardiovascular, diabetes care and vision care fields which are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, and used principally in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals and clinics. The Executive Committee of Johnson & Johnson is the principal management group responsible for the strategic operations and allocation of the resources of the Company. This Committee oversees and coordinates the activities of the Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices business segments. In all of its product lines, the Company competes with companies both locally and globally, throughout the world. Competition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved. Competition in research, involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes, is particularly significant. The development of new and innovative products, as well as protecting the underlying intellectual property of the Company's product portfolio, is important to the Company’s success in all areas of its business. The competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research. In addition, the development and maintenance of customer demand for the Company’s consumer products involves significant expenditures for advertising and promotion. Management’s Objectives The Company manages within a strategic framework with Our Credo as the foundation. The Company believes that our strategic operating principles: being broadly based in human health care, managing the business for the long term, having a decentralized management approach, and being committed to our people and values, are crucial to successfully meeting the demands of the rapidly evolving markets in which we compete. To this end, management is focused on our long-term strategic growth drivers: creating value through innovation, expanding our global reach with a local focus, excellence in execution and leading with purpose. The Company is broadly based in human health care, and is committed to creating value by developing accessible, high quality, innovative products and services. New products introduced within the past five years accounted for approximately 25% of 2015 sales. In 2015, $9.0 billion, or 12.9% of sales, was invested in research and development, reflecting management’s commitment to delivering new and differentiated products and services to meet evolving health care needs and sustain the Company’s long-term growth. Our diverse businesses with more than 250 operating companies located in 60 countries are the key drivers of the Company’s success. Maintaining the Company’s decentralized management approach, while at the same time leveraging the extensive resources of the enterprise, positions the Company well to innovate, execute strategic plans and reach markets globally, as well as address the needs and challenges of the local markets. In order to remain a leader in health care, the Company strives to maintain a purpose-driven organization and is committed to developing global business leaders who can achieve these growth objectives. Businesses are managed for the long-term in order to sustain market leadership positions and enable growth, which provides an enduring source of value to our shareholders. Our Credo unifies all Johnson & Johnson employees in achieving these objectives, and provides a common set of values that serve as the foundation of the Company’s responsibilities to patients, consumers and health care professionals, employees, communities and shareholders. The Company believes that these foundational values, its strategic framework and long-term growth drivers, along with its overall mission of improving the quality of life for people around the world, will enable Johnson & Johnson to continue to be a leader in the health care industry. 9 Results of Operations Analysis of Consolidated Sales In 2015, worldwide sales decreased 5.7% to $70.1 billion, compared to increases of 4.2% in 2014 and 6.1% in 2013. These sales changes consisted of the following: Sales increase/(decrease) due to: 2015 2014 2013 Volume 1.2 % 6.3 7.6 Price 0.6 (0.2 ) 0.1 Currency (7.5 ) (1.9 ) (1.6 ) Total (5.7 )% 4.2 6.1 In 2015, the introduction of competitive products to the Company's Hepatitis C products, OLYSIO ® /SOVRIAD ® (simeprevir) and INCIVO ® (telaprevir), had a negative impact of 2.7% on the worldwide operational sales growth.  In 2015, the impact of acquisitions and divestitures on the worldwide operational sales growth was negative 2.0%. In 2014, sales of the Company's Hepatitis C products, OLYSIO ® /SOVRIAD ® (simeprevir) and INCIVO ® (telaprevir), had a positive impact of 2.8%, and the divestiture of the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics business had a negative impact of 1.4% on the worldwide operational growth. In 2013, the acquisition of Synthes, Inc., net of the related divestiture, increased worldwide operational growth by 2.5%. Sales by U.S. companies were $35.7 billion in 2015, $34.8 billion in 2014 and $31.9 billion in 2013. This represents increases of 2.6% in 2015, 9.0% in 2014 and 7.0% in 2013. Sales by international companies were $34.4 billion in 2015, $39.5 billion in 2014 and $39.4 billion in 2013. This represents a decrease of 13.1% in 2015, and increases of 0.4% in 2014 and 5.4% in 2013. The five-year compound annual growth rates for worldwide, U.S. and international sales were 2.6%, 3.9% and 1.4%, respectively. The ten-year compound annual growth rates for worldwide, U.S. and international sales were 3.3%, 2.3% and 4.5%, respectively. Sales by companies in Europe experienced a decline of 15.6% as compared to the prior year, including operational growth of 1.1%, offset by a negative currency impact of 16.7%. Sales by companies in the Western Hemisphere (excluding the U.S.) experienced a decline of 15.6% as compared to the prior year, including operational growth of 2.6% offset by a negative currency impact of 18.2%.  Sales by companies in the Asia-Pacific, Africa region experienced a decline of 8.1% as compared to the prior year, including operational growth of 0.3% and a negative currency impact of 8.4%. 2015 results benefited from the inclusion of a 53rd week. (See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for Annual Closing Date details). The Company estimated that the fiscal year 2015 growth rate was enhanced by approximately 1.0%. While the additional week added a few days to sales, it also added a full week's worth of operating costs; therefore, the net earnings impact was negligible. In 2015 and 2014, the Company had one wholesaler distributing products for all three segments that represented approximately 12.5% and 11.0%, respectively, of the total consolidated revenues.  In 2013, the Company did not have a customer that represented 10% or more of total consolidated revenues. U.S. Health Care Reform On July 28, 2014, the Internal Revenue Service issued final regulations for the Branded Prescription Drug Fee, an annual non-tax deductible fee imposed on entities engaged in the business of manufacturing or importing branded prescription drugs (covered  entities), enacted by Section 9008 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.  The final regulations accelerated the expense recognition criteria for the fee obligation by one year, from the year in which the fee is paid to the year in which the sales used to calculate the fee occur.  This change impacted covered entities and resulted in the need for all entities to record an additional expense in 2014 for the fee that would have otherwise been expensed when paid in 2015. The Company accrued an additional $220 million in the fiscal third quarter of 2014 due to this change. The fee associated with this accelerated expense was paid, as scheduled, in 2015 and had no cash impact in 2014. 10 Analysis of Sales by Business Segments Consumer Segment Consumer segment sales in 2015 were $13.5 billion, a decrease of 6.8% from 2014, which included 2.7% operational growth offset by a negative currency impact of 9.5%.  U.S. Consumer segment sales were $5.2 billion, an increase of 2.5%.  International sales were $8.3 billion, a decrease of 11.9%, which included 2.7% operational growth offset by a negative currency impact of 14.6%.  In 2015, divestitures had a negative impact of 1.4% on the worldwide Consumer segment operational growth. Major Consumer Franchise Sales: % Change (Dollars in Millions) 2015 2014 2013 ’15 vs. ’14 ’14 vs. ’13 OTC $ 3,975 4,106 4,028 (3.2 )% 1.9 Skin Care 3,531 3,758 3,704 (6.0 ) 1.5 Baby Care 2,044 2,239 2,295 (8.7 ) (2.4 ) Oral Care 1,580 1,647 1,622 (4.1 ) 1.5 Women’s Health 1,200 1,302 1,568 (7.8 ) (17.0 ) Wound Care/Other 1,177 1,444 1,480 (18.5 ) (2.4 ) Total Consumer Sales $ 13,507 14,496 14,697 (6.8 )% (1.4 ) The Over-the-Counter (OTC) franchise sales of $4.0 billion decreased 3.2% as compared to the prior year, which included 8.1% operational growth and a negative currency impact of 11.3%. Operational growth was primarily driven by analgesics, upper respiratory, including ZYRTEC ® , and digestive health products. McNEIL-PPC, Inc. (now Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc.) (McNEIL-PPC) continues to operate under a consent decree, signed in 2011 with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which governs certain McNeil Consumer Healthcare manufacturing operations and requires McNEIL-PPC to remediate the facilities it operates in Lancaster, Pennsylvania; Fort Washington, Pennsylvania; and Las Piedras, Puerto Rico (the Consent Decree). In February 2015, a third-party expert submitted written certification to the FDA for all three manufacturing sites. Following FDA inspections in 2015, McNEIL-PPC received notifications from the FDA that all three manufacturing facilities are in conformity with applicable laws and regulations.  Under the Consent Decree, after receiving notice from the FDA of being in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, each of the three facilities is subject to a five-year audit period by a third-party cGMP expert.  Thus, a third-party expert will continue to reassess the sites at various times for at least five years. The Skin Care franchise sales of $3.5 billion decreased 6.0% as compared to the prior year, which included 1.3% operational growth and a negative currency impact of 7.3%. Operational growth was primarily due to sales growth of   NEUTROGENA ® and AVEENO ® products partially offset by lower sales in China. The Baby Care franchise sales were $2.0 billion in 2015, a decrease of 8.7% compared to the prior year, which included 1.2% operational growth and a negative currency impact of 9.9%. Operational growth was primarily due to new product launches partially offset by competition in China. The Oral Care franchise sales were $1.6 billion in 2015, a decrease of 4.1% as compared to the prior year, which included 5.2% operational growth and a negative currency impact of 9.3%.  Operational growth was driven by increased sales of LISTERINE ® products, attributable to geographical expansion of new products and successful marketing campaigns. The Women’s Health franchise sales were $1.2 billion in 2015, a decrease of 7.8% as compared to the prior year, which included 7.6% operational growth and a negative currency impact of 15.4%. Operational growth outside the U.S. was driven by new product launches and successful marketing campaigns. The Wound Care/Other franchise sales were $1.2 billion in 2015, a decrease of 18.5% from 2014, primarily due to the SPLENDA ® and BENECOL ® divestitures. Consumer segment sales in 2014 were $14.5 billion, a decrease of 1.4% from 2013, which included 1.0% operational growth offset by a negative currency impact of 2.4%.  U.S. Consumer segment sales were $5.1 billion, a decrease of 1.3%.  International sales were $9.4 billion, a decrease of 1.4%, which included 2.3% operational growth offset by a negative currency impact of 3.7%. 11 Pharmaceutical Segment Pharmaceutical segment sales in 2015 were $31.4 billion, a decrease of 2.7% from 2014, which included operational growth of 4.2% offset by a negative currency impact of 6.9%.  U.S. sales were $18.3 billion, an increase of 5.2%.  International sales were $13.1 billion, a decrease of 12.0%, which included 3.0% operational growth offset by a negative currency impact of 15.0%.  The Pharmaceutical segment operational growth was negatively impacted by 6.5% due to the introduction of competitive products to the Company's Hepatitis C products, OLYSIO ® /SOVRIAD ® (simeprevir) and INCIVO ® (telaprevir), and positively impacted by 1.4% due to an adjustment to previous reserve estimates, including Managed Medicaid rebates primarily in the Cardiovascular/Metabolism/Other therapeutic area. In 2015, divestitures had a negative impact of 0.3% on the worldwide Pharmaceutical segment operational growth.

Immunology products growth of 2.1% included operational growth of 6.9% and a negative currency impact of 4.8%. The increased sales of STELARA ® (ustekinumab) and SIMPONI ® /SIMPONI ARIA ® (golimumab) were due to market growth and increased penetration of SIMPONI ARIA ® . Growth was partially offset by lower REMICADE ® (infliximab) sales to the Company's distributor primarily due to the weakening of the euro and biosimilar competition in Europe. The patents for REMICADE ® in certain countries in Europe expired in February 2015. Biosimilar versions of REMICADE ® have been introduced in certain markets outside the United States, resulting in a reduction in sales of REMICADE ® in those markets. 12 Additional biosimilar competition will likely result in a further reduction in REMICADE ® sales in markets outside the United States.  The timing of the possible introduction of a biosimilar version of REMICADE ® in the United States is subject to enforcement of patent rights, approval by the FDA and compliance with the 180-day notice provisions of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (the BPCIA). On February 9, 2016, the Arthritis Advisory Committee of the FDA recommended by a vote of 21-3 to approve the first investigational biosimilar infliximab across all eligible indications in the United States. There is a risk that a competitor could launch a biosimilar version of REMICADE ® following FDA approval (subject to compliance with the 180-day notice provisions of the BPCIA), even though one or more valid patents are in place.  Introduction to the U.S. market of a biosimilar version of REMICADE ® will result in a reduction in U.S. sales of REMICADE ® .  In 2015, U.S. sales of REMICADE ® were $4.5 billion. The launch of a biosimilar version of REMICADE ® in the U.S. is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and cash flows in 2016. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for legal matters regarding the REMICADE ® patents. Infectious disease products sales were $3.7 billion, a decline of 34.7% from 2014, which included an operational decrease of 27.6% and a negative currency impact of 7.1%. Competitive products to the Company's Hepatitis C products, OLYSIO ® /SOVRIAD ® (simeprevir) and INCIVO ® (telaprevir), had a significant negative impact on U.S. sales and will continue to have a negative impact on future sales. The decline of Hepatitis C sales was partially offset by sales growth of EDURANT ® (rilpivirine) and sales of PREZISTA ® / PREZCOBIX ® /REZOLSTA ® (darunavir/cobicistat). Neuroscience products sales were $6.3 billion, a decrease of 3.5% from 2014, which included an operational growth of 5.0% and a negative currency impact of 8.5%. The U.S. sales growth of CONCERTA ® /methylphenidate was primarily due to a therapeutic equivalence reclassification of generic competitors by the FDA in November 2014. Strong sales of INVEGA SUSTENNA ® /XEPLION ® /INVEGA TRINZA ® (paliperidone palmitate) were primarily due to increased market share and the launch of INVEGA TRINZA ® . Neuroscience products sales were negatively impacted by the U.S. divestiture of NUCYNTA ® (tapentadol) and lower sales of RISPERDAL ® CONSTA ® (risperidone) . Oncology products achieved sales of $4.7 billion in 2015, representing an increase of 5.3% as compared to the prior year. Oncology products growth of 5.3% included operational growth of 17.7% and a negative currency impact of 12.4%. Contributors to the growth were strong sales of IMBRUVICA ® (ibrutinib) due to the approval of new indications, additional country launches and strong patient uptake.  Additionally, sales of ZYTIGA ® (abiraterone acetate) grew in the U.S. due to market growth partially offset by share decline, and strong growth in Asia and Latin America was partially offset by lower sales in Europe due to competition. Cardiovascular/Metabolism/Other products achieved sales of $6.4 billion in 2015, representing an increase of 15.1% as compared to the prior year due to strong sales of XARELTO ® (rivaroxaban) and INVOKANA ® /INVOKAMET ® (canagliflozin).     PROCRIT ® /EPREX ® (Epoetin alfa) sales were impacted by competition. 13 During 2015, the Company advanced its pipeline with several regulatory submissions and approvals for new drugs and additional indications for existing drugs as follows: Product Name          (Chemical Name) Indication US  Approv EU  Approv US Filing EU Filing DARZALEX ™ (daratumumab) For the treatment of double refractory multiple myeloma ü ü EDURANT ® (rilpiravine) For use in combination with other anti-retroviral agents, for the treatment-naïve adolescent patients aged 12 to 18 years with HIV-1 infection ü ü IMBRUVICA ® (ibrutinib) Treatment of Waldenström's Macroglobulinemia ü ü Treatment for patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma in combination with bendamustine and rituximab ü ü For use in treatment-naïve patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia ü ü INVEGA TRINZA ® (paliperidone palmitate) An atypical antipsychotic injection administered four times a year for the treatment of schizophrenia ü ü INVOKAMET ® XR (canagliflozin) A once-daily therapy combining fixed doses of canagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride extended release for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes ü PREZCOBIX ® (darunavir/cobicistat) For use in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) ü SIMPONI ® (golimumab) Treatment of non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis ü STELARA ® (ustekinumab) For the treatment of adolescents with moderate-to-severe psoriasis ü For the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease ü ü VELCADE ® (bortezomib) For use in combination with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and prednisone for the treatment of adult patients with previously untreated mantle cell lymphoma ü YONDELIS ® (trabectedin) For the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic liposarcoma or leiomyosarcoma ü The Pharmaceutical segment achieved sales of $32.3 billion in 2014, representing an increase of 14.9% over the prior year, with strong operational growth of 16.5% and a negative currency impact of 1.6%.  U.S. sales were $17.4 billion, an increase of 25.0%.  International sales were $14.9 billion, an increase of 5.0%, which included 8.3% operational growth and a negative currency impact of 3.3%. In 2013, Pharmaceutical segment sales included a positive adjustment to previous estimates for Managed Medicaid rebates. This negatively impacted 2014 Pharmaceutical operational sales growth by 0.8% as compared to the prior year. In 2014, sales of the Company's Hepatitis C products, OLYSIO ® /SOVRIAD ® (simeprevir) and INCIVO ® (telaprevir), had a positive impact of 6.9% on the operational growth of the Pharmaceutical segment. 14 Medical Devices Segment The Medical Devices segment sales in 2015 were $25.1 billion, a decrease of 8.7% from 2014, which included an operational decline of 1.4% and a negative currency impact of 7.3%. U.S. sales were $12.1 billion, a decrease of 1.0% as compared to the prior year.  International sales were $13.0 billion, a decrease of 14.8% as compared to the prior year, with an operational decrease of 1.7% and a negative currency impact of 13.1%. The divestitures of the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics and the Cordis Businesses had a negative impact of 3.2% and 0.6%, respectively, on the worldwide operational growth of the Medical Devices segment as compared to 2014.

The Orthopaedics franchise sales were $9.3 billion in 2015, a decrease of 4.3% from 2014, which included operational growth of 1.7% and a negative currency impact of 6.0%. Operational growth in the U.S. and Europe regions was primarily driven by sales of the hip primary stem platform, the ATTUNE ® Knee System, trauma TFNA nailing system and sports medicine ORTHOVISC ® /MONOVISC ® products. Growth was negatively impacted by softer demand and a reduction in customer inventory levels primarily in China and continued pricing pressures. The Surgery franchise sales were $9.2 billion in 2015, a decrease of 5.1% from 2014, which included operational growth of 2.7% and a negative currency impact of 7.8%. Operational growth in Advanced Surgery was driven by endocutter, biosurgical and energy products, primarily attributable to market growth, increased penetration in certain markets and new product launches. Operational growth in Specialty Surgery was primarily driven by Mentor products. Growth was partially offset by lower sales of women's health and urology products in General Surgery. The Vision Care franchise sales were $2.6 billion in 2015, a decrease of 7.5% from 2014, which included operational growth of 1.7% and a negative currency impact of 9.2%.  Operational growth in all the major regions was primarily driven by new product launches partially offset by lower price. The Cardiovascular franchise sales were $2.0 billion, a decrease of 7.8% from 2014, which represented an operational decline of 0.1% and a negative currency impact of 7.7%. Strong operational growth in the electrophysiology business was driven by market growth and the success of the THERMOCOOL ® SMARTTOUCH ® Catheter and was offset by the impact of divesting the Cordis business. The Company completed the divestiture of the Cordis business to Cardinal Health on October 4, 2015. The Cordis business generated annual net revenues of approximately $535 million and $780 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. For additional details see Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Diabetes Care franchise sales were $1.9 billion, a decrease of 10.0% from 2014, which represented an operational decline of 0.7% and a negative currency impact of 9.3%. The operational decline was primarily due to lower price partially offset by the success of the ANIMAS ® VIBE ® products. On June 30, 2014, the Company divested the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics business (the Diagnostics Franchise) to The Carlyle Group. For additional details see Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 15 The Medical Devices segment sales in 2014 were $27.5 billion, a decrease of 3.4% from 2013, which included an operational decline of 1.6% and a negative currency impact of 1.8%. U.S. sales were $12.3 billion, a decrease of 4.3% as compared to the prior year.  International sales were $15.3 billion, a decline of 2.7% as compared to the prior year, with operational growth of 0.5% offset by a negative currency impact of 3.2%. In 2014, the divestiture of the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics business had a negative impact of 3.2% on the operational growth of the Medical Devices segment. Analysis of Consolidated Earnings Before Provision for Taxes on Income Consolidated earnings before provision for taxes on income decreased to $19.2 billion as compared to $20.6 billion in 2014, a decrease of 6.6%. The decrease was primarily attributable to significantly lower sales of OLYSIO ® /SOVRIAD ® (simeprevir), negative currency impacts, a restructuring charge of $0.6 billion and higher intangible asset write-downs of $0.1 billion in 2015 as compared to 2014. The decrease was partially offset by lower net litigation expense of $1.1 billion, lower Synthes integration costs of $0.6 billion, a positive adjustment of $0.4 billion to previous reserve estimates including Managed Medicaid rebates, and higher gains of $0.3 billion from divestitures as compared to the prior year.  The fiscal year 2015 included higher gains of $0.3 billion primarily from the divestitures of the Cordis business, the SPLENDA ® brand and the U.S. divestiture of NUCYNTA ® versus the gains recorded in 2014 from the divestitures of the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics business and the K-Y ® brand. Additionally, 2014 included an additional year of the Branded Prescription Drug Fee of $0.2 billion. Consolidated earnings before provision for taxes on income increased to $20.6 billion in 2014 as compared to $15.5 billion in 2013, an increase of 32.9%. Earnings before provision for taxes on income were favorable due to strong sales volume growth, particularly sales of OLYSIO ® /SOVRIAD ® (simeprevir), positive mix from higher sales of higher margin products in the Pharmaceutical business, divestitures of lower margin businesses and cost reduction efforts across many of the businesses.  Additionally, 2014 included  higher net gains on divestitures of $2.3 billion, primarily the divestiture of the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics business, lower litigation expense of $1.0 billion, lower in-process research and development costs of $0.4 billion and lower expenses of $0.1 billion related to the DePuy ASR™ Hip program as compared to the fiscal year 2013. This was partially offset by the inclusion of an additional year of the Branded Prescription Drug Fee of $0.2 billion and $0.1 billion of higher Synthes integration/transaction costs in 2014. The fiscal year 2013 included a net gain of $0.4 billion on equity investment transactions, primarily the sale of Elan American Depositary Shares. As a percent to sales, consolidated earnings before provision for taxes on income in 2015 was 27.4% versus 27.7% in 2014. Cost of Products Sold and Selling, Marketing and Administrative Expenses: Cost of products sold and selling, marketing and administrative expenses as a percent to sales were as follows: % of Sales 2015 2014 2013 Cost of products sold 30.7 % 30.6 31.3 Percent point increase/(decrease) over the prior year 0.1 (0.7 ) (0.9 ) Selling, marketing and administrative expenses 30.3 % 29.5 30.6 Percent point increase/(decrease) over the prior year 0.8 (1.1 ) (0.4 ) In 2015, cost of products sold as a percent to sales increased slightly as compared to the prior year.  Favorable mix between the segments was offset by $81 million associated with the restructuring activity in the Medical Devices segment, negative transactional currency and lower sales of OLYSIO ® /SOVRIAD ® (simeprevir) in 2015.  Intangible asset amortization expense included in cost of products sold for 2015 and 2014 was $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively. There was an increase in the percent to sales of selling, marketing and administrative expenses in 2015 compared to the prior year, primarily due to incremental investment spending in all the segments and the impact from lower sales of OLYSIO ® /SOVRIAD ® (simeprevir), partially offset by favorable mix and the inclusion of an additional year of the Branded Prescription Drug Fee of $0.2 billion in 2014. In 2014, cost of products sold as a percent to sales decreased compared to the prior year. This was primarily the result of positive mix from higher sales of higher margin products in the Pharmaceutical business, divestitures of lower margin businesses and cost improvements across many of the businesses. This was partially offset by pricing and the impact of negative transactional currency. In addition, 2013 included an inventory step-up charge of $0.1 billion related to the Synthes acquisition. Intangible asset amortization expense included in cost of products sold for both 2014 and 2013 was $1.4 billion. There was a decrease in the percent to sales of selling, marketing and administrative expenses in 2014 compared to the prior year primarily due to leveraged costs resulting from growth in the Pharmaceutical business, particularly sales of OLYSIO ® /SOVRIAD ® (simeprevir), and cost containment initiatives across many of the businesses. This was partially offset by the inclusion of an additional year of the Branded Prescription Drug Fee of $220 million in the fiscal third quarter of 2014. 16 Research and Development Expense: Research and development expense by segment of business was as follows: 2015 2014 2013 (Dollars in Millions) Amount % of Sales* Amount % of Sales* Amount % of Sales* Consumer $ 625 4.6 % 629 4.3 590 4.0 Pharmaceutical 6,821 21.7 6,213 19.2 5,810 20.7 Medical Devices 1,600 6.4 1,652 6.0 1,783 6.3 Total research and development expense $ 9,046 12.9 % 8,494 11.4 8,183 11.5 Percent increase/(decrease) over the prior year 6.5 % 3.8 6.8 * As a percent to segment sales Research and development activities represent a significant part of the Company's business.  These expenditures relate to the processes of discovering, testing and developing new products, upfront payments and milestones, improving existing products, as well as ensuring product efficacy and regulatory compliance prior to launch.  The Company remains committed to investing in research and development with the aim of delivering high quality and innovative products. In 2015, worldwide costs of research and development activities increased by 6.5% compared to 2014. The increase as a percent to sales was attributable to increased investment spending primarily in the Pharmaceutical segment, lower overall sales and business mix. In 2014, worldwide costs of research and development activities increased by 3.8% compared to 2013. The reduction as a percent to sales was primarily due to strong sales growth in the Pharmaceutical business. Research spending in the Pharmaceutical segment increased in absolute dollars to $6.2 billion as compared to $5.8 billion primarily due to higher levels of spending to advance the Company's Pharmaceutical pipeline. In-Process Research and Development (IPR&D): In 2015, the Company recorded an IPR&D charge of $0.2 billion primarily for the discontinuation of certain development projects related to Covagen.  In 2014, the Company recorded an IPR&D charge of $0.2 billion for the impairment of various IPR&D projects related to RespiVert, Crucell, Mentor and Synthes for the delay or  discontinuation of certain development projects.  In 2013, the Company recorded an IPR&D charge of $0.6 billion primarily for the impairment of various IPR&D projects related to Crucell, CorImmun and Acclarent for the delay or discontinuation of certain development projects. Other (Income) Expense, Net: Other (income) expense, net is the account where the Company records gains and losses related to the sale and write-down of certain investments in equity securities held by Johnson & Johnson Innovation - JJDC, Inc. (formerly Johnson & Johnson Development Corporation), gains and losses on divestitures, transactional currency gains and losses, acquisition-related costs, litigation accruals and settlements, as well as royalty income. The change in other (income) expense, net for the fiscal year 2015 was a favorable change of $2.0 billion as compared to the prior year primarily due to lower litigation expense of $1.1 billion, lower Synthes integration costs of $0.6 billion and higher JJDC portfolio gains of $0.2 billion as compared to the prior year.  Additionally, the fiscal year 2015 included higher gains of $0.3 billion primarily from the divestitures of the Cordis business, the SPLENDA ® brand and the U.S. divestiture of NUCYNTA ® versus the gains recorded in 2014 from the divestitures of the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics business and the K-Y ® brand. This was partially offset by higher intangible asset write-downs of $0.1 billion in 2015. The change in other (income) expense, net for the fiscal year 2014 was a favorable change of $2.6 billion as compared to the prior year.  The fiscal year 2014 included higher net gains on divestitures of $2.3 billion, primarily the divestiture of the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics business, lower litigation expense of $1.0 billion and lower costs of $0.1 billion related to the DePuy ASR ™ Hip program as compared to 2013. This was partially offset by higher Synthes integration/transaction costs of $0.2 billion and higher intangible asset write-downs of $0.1 billion primarily related to INCIVO ® (telaprevir) in 2014. Additionally, the fiscal year 2013 included a higher net gain of $0.5 billion as compared to 2014 on equity investment transactions, primarily the sale of Elan American Depositary Shares. Interest (Income) Expense: Interest income in 2015 increased by $61 million as compared to 2014 due to a higher average balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and higher interest rates. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $38.4 billion at the end of 2015, and averaged $35.7 billion as compared to the $31.1 billion average cash balance in 2014. The increase in the year-end cash balance was primarily due to cash generated from operating activities. Interest expense in 2015 increased slightly as compared to 2014.  The average debt balance was $19.3 billion in 2015 versus $18.5 billion in 2014. The total debt balance at the end of 2015 was $19.9 billion as compared to $18.8 billion at the end of 2014. The higher debt balance of approximately $1.1 billion was an increase in commercial paper for general corporate purposes, primarily the stock repurchase program. Interest income in 2014 was comparable to the prior year. A higher balance in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was offset by lower interest rates. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $33.1 billion at the end of 17 2014, and averaged $31.1 billion as compared to the $25.2 billion average cash balance in 2013. The increase in the year-end cash balance was primarily due to cash generated from operating activities. Interest expense in 2014 increased by $51 million as compared to 2013 due to a higher average debt balance. The average debt balance was $18.5 billion in 2014 versus $17.2 billion in 2013. The total debt balance at the end of 2014 was $18.8 billion as compared to $18.2 billion at the end of 2013. The higher debt balance of approximately $0.6 billion was due to increased borrowings in November 2014. The Company increased borrowings, capitalizing on favorable terms in the capital markets. The proceeds of the borrowings were used for general corporate purposes. Income Before Tax by Segment Income before tax by segment of business were as follows: Percent of Segment Sales (Dollars in Millions) 2015 2014 2015 2014 Consumer $ 1,787 1,941 13.2 % 13.4 Pharmaceutical 11,734 11,696 37.3 36.2 Medical Devices 6,826 7,953 27.2 28.9 Total (1) 20,347 21,590 29.0 29.0 Less: Expenses not allocated to segments (2) 1,151 1,027 Earnings before provision for taxes on income $ 19,196 20,563 27.4 % 27.7 (1) See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details. (2) Amounts not allocated to segments include interest (income) expense, noncontrolling interests, and general corporate (income) expense. Consumer Segment: In 2015, the Consumer segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 13.2%, versus 13.4% in 2014, primarily due to lower divestiture gains in 2015 versus 2014.  In 2015, the Consumer segment tax included a gain of $0.3 billion from divestitures, primarily the divestiture of the SPLENDA ® brand.  In 2014, the Consumer segment included a gain of $0.5 billion from divestitures, primarily the divestiture of the K-Y ® brand. In 2014, the Consumer segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 13.4%, flat to the prior year. Pharmaceutical Segment: In 2015, the Pharmaceutical segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 37.3% versus 36.2% in 2014. The favorable income before tax was primarily due to higher gains recognized in 2015 partially offset by a sales decline of OLYSIO ® /SOVRIAD ® (simeprevir), increased investment spending and negative currency impacts as compared to 2014.  Included in 2015 was a gain of $1.0 billion on the U.S. divestiture of NUCYNTA ® , as well as receipt of a contingent payment and a positive adjustment to previous reserve estimates, including Managed Medicaid rebates. Additionally, the Pharmaceutical segment income before tax in 2014 was negatively impacted by $0.2 billion for an additional year of the Branded Prescription Drug Fee and higher intangible asset amortization expense of $0.3 billion primarily related to the write-down of INCIVO ® (telaprevir). In 2014, the Pharmaceutical segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 36.2% versus 32.6% in 2013. The favorable income before tax was attributable to strong sales volume growth, particularly sales of OLYSIO ® /SOVRIAD ® (simeprevir), positive sales mix of higher margin products and cost containment initiatives realized in selling, marketing and administrative expenses. This was partially offset by $0.2 billion for an additional year of the Branded Prescription Drug Fee and a $0.1 billion intangible asset write-down related to INCIVO ® (telaprevir). Additionally, 2013 included a net gain of $0.4 billion on equity investment transactions, primarily the sale of Elan American Depositary Shares, and a positive adjustment of $0.2 billion to previous estimates for Managed Medicaid rebates, partially offset by higher write-downs of $0.4 billion for the impairment of IPR&D as compared to 2014. Medical Devices Segment: In 2015, the Medical Devices segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 27.2% versus 28.9% in 2014 primarily due to a restructuring charge of $0.6 billion, an intangible asset write-down of $0.3 billion related to Acclarent, and lower gains of $0.5 billion on divestitures as compared to 2014.  In 2015, the Medical Devices segment included gains of $1.4 billion, primarily for the divestiture of the Cordis business versus a gain of $1.9 billion recorded in 2014 for the divestiture of the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics business. The 2015 income before tax was favorably impacted by lower net litigation expense of $0.9 billion, which included a gain from the litigation settlement agreement of $0.6 billion with Guidant, and lower Synthes integration costs of $0.6 billion in 2015 as compared to 2014. 18 In 2014, Medical Devices segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 28.9% versus 18.5% in 2013. The favorable income before tax was attributable to the net gain of $1.9 billion on the divestiture of the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics business in 2014 and lower litigation expense of $1.1 billion as compared to 2013. Restructuring: The Company announced restructuring actions in its Medical Devices segment that are expected to result in annualized pre-tax cost savings of $800 million to $1.0 billion, the majority of which is expected to be realized by the end of 2018, including approximately $200 million savings in 2016. The savings will provide the Company with added flexibility and resources to fund investment in new growth opportunities and innovative solutions for customers and patients. The Company estimates that, in connection with its plans, it will record pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $2.0 billion to $2.4 billion, most of which are expected to be incurred by 2017. In the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $0.6 billion, of which $81 million is included in cost of products sold.  See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to the restructuring. Provision for Taxes on Income: The worldwide effective income tax rate was 19.7% in 2015 , 20.6% in 2014 and 10.6% in 2013 . The 2015 effective tax rate decrease of 0.9% as compared to 2014 was primarily attributable to the increases in taxable income in lower tax jurisdictions relative to higher tax jurisdictions and a tax benefit resulting from a restructuring of international affiliates.  Additionally, the 2014 effective tax rate was affected by the items mentioned below. The increase in the 2014 effective tax rate, as compared to 2013, was attributable to the following: the divestiture of the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics business at an approximate 44% effective tax rate, litigation accruals at low tax rates, the mix of earnings into higher tax jurisdictions, primarily the U.S., the accrual of an additional year of the Branded Prescription Drug Fee, which is not tax deductible, and additional U.S. tax expense related to a planned increase in dividends from current year foreign earnings as compared to the prior year.  These increases to the 2014 effective tax rate were partially offset by a tax benefit of $0.4 billion associated with the Conor Medsystems divestiture. The 2014 effective tax rate was also reduced as the Company adjusted its unrecognized tax benefits as a result of (i) the federal appeals court’s decision in OMJ Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s litigation regarding credits under former Section 936 of the Internal Revenue Code (see Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information), and (ii) a settlement of substantially all issues related to the Company’s U.S. Internal Revenue Service audit of tax years 2006 - 2009. The 2013 effective tax rate was reduced by a tax benefit associated with the write-off of assets for tax purposes associated with Scios, Inc., and the inclusion of both the 2013 and 2012 benefit from the Research and Development tax credit and the Controlled Foreign Corporation look-through provisions, because those provisions were enacted into law in January 2013 and were retroactive to January 1, 2012. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity & Cash Flows Cash and cash equivalents were $13.7 billion at the end of 2015 as compared to $14.5 billion at the end of 2014.  The primary sources and uses of cash that contributed to the $0.8 billion decrease were approximately $19.3 billion of cash generated from operating activities offset by $7.7 billion net cash used by investing activities, and $10.8 billion net cash used by financing activities, and $1.5 billion due to the effect on exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents. In addition, the Company had $24.6 billion in marketable securities at the end of 2015 and $18.6 billion at the end of 2014. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Cash flow from operations of $19.3 billion was the result of $15.4 billion of net earnings and $5.4 billion of non-cash charges and other adjustments for depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation and assets write-downs, primarily related to Acclarent and Venezuela write-downs, reduced by $2.6 billion from net gains on sale of assets/businesses, and $1.2 billion related to deferred taxes, accounts receivable and inventories.  Additional sources of operating cash flow of $2.2 billion resulted from a decrease in other current and non-current assets and an increase in other current and non-current liabilities. Investing activities use of $7.7 billion was primarily for net purchases of investments in marketable securities of $6.7 billion, additions to property, plant and equipment of $3.5 billion, and acquisitions, net of cash acquired of $1.0 billion, partially offset by $3.5 billion of proceeds from the disposal of assets/businesses. Financing activities use of $10.8 billion was primarily for dividends to shareholders of $8.2 billion and $5.3 billion for the repurchase of common stock. Financing activities also included a source of $1.4 billion from net proceeds of short and long-term debt and $1.3 billion of net proceeds from stock options exercised and associated tax benefits. On October 13, 2015, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program, authorizing the Company to purchase up to $10.0 billion of the Company's shares of common stock. As of January 3, 2016, $1.0 billion has been repurchased under the program. The repurchase program has no time limit and may be suspended for periods or discontinued at any time. Any shares acquired will be available for general corporate purposes. The Company intends to finance the share repurchase program through available cash and access to the capital markets. The previous share repurchase program approved on July 21, 2014, authorizing the Company to purchase up to $5.0 billion of the Company's shares of common stock, was completed on April 28, 2015. 19 In 2015, the Company continued to have access to liquidity through the commercial paper market.  The Company has a shelf registration with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that enables the Company to issue debt securities and warrants to purchase debt securities on a timely basis. For additional details on borrowings, see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company anticipates that operating cash flows, existing credit facilities and access to the capital markets will provide sufficient resources to fund operating needs in 2016. Concentration of Credit Risk Global concentration of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivables continues to be limited due to the large number of customers globally and adherence to internal credit policies and credit limits. Economic challenges in Italy, Spain, Greece and Portugal (the Southern European Region) have impacted certain payment patterns, which have historically been longer than those experienced in the U.S. and other international markets.  The total net trade accounts receivable balance in the Southern European Region was approximately $1.3 billion as of January 3, 2016 and $1.8 billion as of December 28, 2014. Approximately $0.8 billion as of January 3, 2016 and approximately $1.1 billion as of December 28, 2014 of the Southern European Region net trade accounts receivable balance related to the Company's Consumer, Vision Care and Diabetes Care businesses as well as certain Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices customers which are in line with historical collection patterns. The remaining balance of net trade accounts receivable in the Southern European Region has been negatively impacted by the timing of payments from certain government owned or supported health care customers, as well as certain distributors of the Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices local affiliates. The total net trade accounts receivable balance for these customers were approximately $0.5 billion at January 3, 2016 and $0.7 billion at December 28, 2014.  The Company continues to receive payments from these customers and, in some cases, late payments with interest. For customers where payment is expected over periods of time longer than one year, revenue and trade receivables have been discounted over the estimated period of time for collection. Allowances for doubtful accounts have been increased for these customers, but have been immaterial to date. The Company will continue to work closely with these customers on payment plans, monitor the economic situation and take appropriate actions as necessary. Financing and Market Risk The Company uses financial instruments to manage the impact of foreign exchange rate changes on cash flows. Accordingly, the Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to protect the value of certain foreign currency assets and liabilities and to hedge future foreign currency transactions primarily related to product costs.  Gains or losses on these contracts are offset by the gains or losses on the underlying transactions.  A 10% appreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the January 3, 2016 market rates would increase the unrealized value of the Company’s forward contracts by $15 million.  Conversely, a 10% depreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the January 3, 2016 market rates would decrease the unrealized value of the Company’s forward contracts by $18 million.  In either scenario, the gain or loss on the forward contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction, and therefore, would have no impact on future anticipated earnings and cash flows. The Company hedges the exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and the effect on certain assets and liabilities in foreign currency, by entering into currency swap contracts.  A 1% change in the spread between U.S. and foreign interest rates on the Company’s interest rate sensitive financial instruments would either increase or decrease the unrealized value of the Company’s swap contracts by approximately $115 million.  In either scenario, at maturity, the gain or loss on the swap contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction, and therefore, would have no impact on future anticipated cash flows. The Company does not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Further, the Company has a policy of only entering into contracts with parties that have at least an investment grade credit rating.  The counter-parties to these contracts are major financial institutions and there is no significant concentration of exposure with any one counter-party. Management believes the risk of loss is remote. The Company invests in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities which carry a degree of interest rate risk. The fair market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall.  A 1% (100 basis points) change in spread on the Company’s interest rate sensitive investments would either increase or decrease the unrealized value of cash equivalents and current marketable securities by approximately $314 million. The Company has access to substantial sources of funds at numerous banks worldwide.  In September 2015, the Company secured a new 364-day Credit Facility. Total credit available to the Company approximates $10 billion, which expires on September 15, 2016.  Interest charged on borrowings under the credit line agreement is based on either bids provided by banks, the prime rate or London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR), plus applicable margins. Commitment fees under the agreement are not material. Total borrowings at the end of 2015 and 2014 were $19.9 billion and $18.8 billion, respectively.  The increase in borrowings between 2015 and 2014 was a result of financing for the Company's share repurchase program. In 2015, net cash 20 (cash and current marketable securities, net of debt) was $18.5 billion compared to net cash of $14.3 billion in 2014.  Total debt represented 21.8% of total capital (shareholders’ equity and total debt) in 2015 and 21.2% of total capital in 2014. Shareholders’ equity per share at the end of 2015 was $25.82 compared to $25.06 at year-end 2014 , an increase of 3.0%. A summary of borrowings can be found in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Contractual Obligations and Commitments The Company’s contractual obligations are primarily for leases, debt and unfunded retirement plans.  There are no other significant obligations. To satisfy these obligations, the Company will use cash from operations.  The following table summarizes the Company’s contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as of January 3, 2016 (see Notes 7, 10 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details): (Dollars in Millions) Debt Obligations Interest on Debt Obligations Unfunded Retirement Plans Operating Leases Total 2016 $ 2,104 586 76 224 2,990 2017 1,790 554 77 194 2,615 2018 1,501 490 82 136 2,209 2019 1,587 446 88 90 2,211 2020 683 373 93 74 1,223 After 2020 7,296 4,303 559 109 12,267 Total $ 14,961 6,752 975 827 23,515 For tax matters, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Dividends The Company increased its dividend in 2015 for the 53rd consecutive year.  Cash dividends paid were $2.95 per share in 2015 compared with dividends of $2.76 per share in 2014 , and $2.59 per share in 2013 .  The dividends were distributed as follows: 2015 2014 2013 First quarter $ 0.70 0.66 0.61 Second quarter 0.75 0.70 0.66 Third quarter 0.75 0.70 0.66 Fourth quarter 0.75 0.70 0.66 Total $ 2.95 2.76 2.59 On January 4, 2016, the Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.75 per share, payable on March 8, 2016, to shareholders of record as of February 23, 2016.  The Company expects to continue the practice of paying regular cash dividends. Other Information Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
