MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION Organization and Business Segments Description of the Company and Business Segments Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) have approximately 135,100 employees worldwide engaged in the research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the health care field. The Company conducts business in virtually all countries of the world with the primary focus on products related to human health and well-being. The Company is organized into three business segments: Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices. The Consumer segment includes a broad range of products used in the baby care, oral care, beauty, over-the-counter pharmaceutical, women’s health and wound care markets. These products are marketed to the general public and sold both to retail outlets and distributors throughout the world. The Pharmaceutical segment is focused on six therapeutic areas, including immunology, infectious diseases, neuroscience, oncology, pulmonary hypertension, and cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Products in this segment are distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers, hospitals and health care professionals for prescription use. The Medical Devices segment includes a broad range of products used in the orthopaedic, surgery, interventional solutions (cardiovascular and neurovascular), diabetes care (divested in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2018) and vision fields which are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, and used principally in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals and clinics. The Executive Committee of Johnson & Johnson is the principal management group responsible for the strategic operations and allocation of the resources of the Company. This Committee oversees and coordinates the activities of the Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices business segments. In all of its product lines, the Company competes with companies both locally and globally, throughout the world. Competition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved. Competition in research, involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes, is particularly significant. The development of new and innovative products, as well as protecting the underlying intellectual property of the Company's product portfolio, is important to the Company’s success in all areas of its business. The competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research. In addition, the development and maintenance of customer demand for the Company’s consumer products involves significant expenditures for advertising and promotion. Management’s Objectives With “Our Credo” as the foundation, the Company’s purpose is to blend heart, science and ingenuity to profoundly change the trajectory of health for humanity. The Company is committed to bringing its full breadth and depth to ensure health for people today and for future generations. United around this common ambition, the Company is poised to fulfill its purpose and successfully meet the demands of the rapidly evolving markets in which it competes. The Company is broadly based in human healthcare, and is committed to creating value by developing accessible, high quality, innovative products and services. New products introduced within the past five years accounted for approximately 25% of 2018 sales. In 2018, $10.8 billion was invested in research and development and $0.9 billion spent on acquisitions, reflecting management’s commitment to create life-enhancing innovations and to create value through partnerships that will profoundly change the trajectory of health for humanity. A critical driver of the Company’s success, is the 135,100 diverse employees that work across more than 260 operating companies, which are located in more than 60 countries. Employees are empowered and inspired to lead with the Company’s Our Credo and purpose as guides. This allows every employee to use the Company’s reach and size to advance the Company's purpose, and to also lead with agility and urgency. Leveraging the extensive resources across the enterprise, enables the Company to innovate and execute with excellence. This ensures the Company can remain focused on addressing the unmet needs of society every day and invest for an enduring impact, ultimately delivering value to its patients, consumers and healthcare professionals, employees, communities and shareholders. 16 Results of Operations Analysis of Consolidated Sales In 2018, worldwide sales increased 6.7% to $81.6 billion, compared to an increases of 6.3% and 2.6% in 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Growth was primarily driven by NEUTROGENA ® , OGX ® and AVEENO ® products as well as strength of DR. CI: LABO and DABAO ® products outside the U.S. Growth was partially offset by the divestiture of NIZORAL ® . The Over-the-Counter (OTC) franchise sales of $4.3 billion increased 5.0% as compared to the prior year. Growth was primarily driven by share, consumption and market growth across multiple brands including ZYRTEC ® , TYLENOL ® and Children's MOTRIN ® , as well as digestive health products and anti-smoking aids. Additionally, sales from the recent U.S. acquisition of Zarbee's Inc. contributed approximately 0.9% to growth. The Baby Care franchise sales were $1.9 billion in 2018, a decrease of 3.0% compared to the prior year, primarily due to JOHNSON's ® share decline and increased trade promotions due to the JOHNSON's ® baby relaunch and the negative impact of currency. This was partially offset by strong growth of AVEENO ® baby driven by geographic expansion. The Oral Care franchise sales of $1.6 billion increased 1.6% as compared to the prior year, primarily driven by strong marketing campaigns and new product launches. The Women’s Health franchise sales were $1.0 billion in 2018, a decrease of 0.1% as compared to the prior year. Growth in Latin America was offset by the negative impact of currency. The Wound Care/Other franchise sales were $0.7 billion in 2018, a decrease of 13.4% as compared to the prior year, primarily due to the divestiture of COMPEED ® . Consumer segment sales in 2017 were $13.6 billion, an increase of 2.2% from 2016, which included 1.3% operational growth and a positive currency impact of 0.9%.  U.S. Consumer segment sales were $5.6 billion, an increase of 2.7%.  International sales were $8.0 billion, an increase of 1.9%, which included 0.4% operational growth and a positive currency impact of 1.5%.  In 2017, acquisitions and divestitures had a net positive impact of 1.8% on the operational sales growth of the worldwide Consumer segment. 18 Pharmaceutical Segment Pharmaceutical segment sales in 2018 were $40.7 billion, an increase of 12.4% from 2017, which included operational growth of 11.8% and a positive currency impact of 0.6%.  U.S. sales were $23.3 billion, an increase of 8.4%.  International sales were $17.4 billion, an increase of 18.0%, which included 16.5% operational growth and a positive currency impact of 1.5%.

Growth was driven by strong uptake of STELARA ® (ustekinumab) in Crohn's disease, strong launch uptake of TREMFYA ® (guselkumab), expanded indications of SIMPONI ® /SIMPONI ARIA ® (golimumab), and the U.S. immunology market growth. Immunology was negatively impacted by lower sales of REMICADE ® (infliximab) due to increased discounts/rebates and biosimilar competition. The patents for REMICADE ® (infliximab) in certain countries in Europe expired in February 2015. Biosimilar versions of REMICADE ® have been introduced in certain markets outside the U.S., resulting in a reduction in sales of REMICADE ® in those markets.  Additional biosimilar competition will likely result in a further reduction in REMICADE ® sales in markets outside the United States. In the U.S., a biosimilar version of REMICADE ® was introduced in 2016, and additional competitors continue to enter the market. Continued infliximab biosimilar competition in the U.S. market will result in a further reduction in U.S. sales of REMICADE ® . See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of legal matters regarding the REMICADE ® patents. Infectious disease products sales were $3.3 billion in 2018, representing an increase of 4.8% as compared to the prior year. Sales growth of PREZCOBIX ® /REZOLSTA ® (darunavir/cobicistat), EDURANT ® /rilpivirine, and the launch of SYMTUZA ® and JULUCA ® (dolutegravir/rilpivirine) was partially offset by lower sales of PREZISTA ® (darunavir). Neuroscience products sales were $6.1 billion, representing an increase of 1.5% as compared to the prior year. Strong sales of long-acting injectables INVEGA TRINZA ® /TREVICTA ® (paliperidone palmitate) and INVEGA SUSTENNA ® /XEPLION ® were partially offset by cannibalization of RISPERDAL CONSTA ® (risperidone) and generic competition for CONCERTA ® /methylphenidate. Oncology products achieved sales of $9.8 billion in 2018, representing an increase of 35.6% as compared to the prior year. Contributors to the growth were strong sales of DARZALEX ® (daratumumab) with continued market growth and share gain, IMBRUVICA ® (ibrutinib) due to increased patient uptake globally and sales of ZYTIGA ® (abiraterone acetate) driven by LATITUDE data and market growth. Additionally, sales from the launch of ERLEADA™ (apalutamide) contributed to the growth. A number of companies marketing generic pharmaceuticals have filed Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) with the FDA, or undertaken similar regulatory processes outside of the U.S., seeking to market generic forms of ZYTIGA ® prior to expiration of its applicable patents. These ANDAs include allegations of non-infringement and invalidity of the applicable patents. In October 2018, the Court issued a ruling invalidating all asserted claims of the applicable patent. Janssen has appealed the Court’s decision.  In November 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit denied Janssen’s request for an injunction pending appeal.  As a result, several generic versions of ZYTIGA ® have entered the market, resulting in a decline in sales of ZYTIGA ® in the United States. In 2018, the Company reported U.S. sales of $1.8 billion for ZYTIGA ® . See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of legal matters regarding ZYTIGA ® . The Pulmonary Hypertension therapeutic area was established with the acquisition of Actelion Ltd on June 16, 2017. Sales in 2018 represented a full year as compared to half a year in 2017.  Sales of OPSUMIT ® (macitentan) and UPTRAVI ® (selexipag) were positively impacted by market growth and share gains while sales of TRACLEER ® (bosetan) were negatively impacted by increased use of OPSUMIT ® and generics. Cardiovascular/Metabolism/Other products sales were $5.8 billion, a decline of 7.5% as compared to the prior year. Lower sales of INVOKANA ® /INVOKAMET ® (canagliflozin) in the U.S. was primarily due to an increase in price discounts, higher rebates and market share decline driven by competitive pressure. Lower sales of XARELTO ® (rivaroxaban) were driven by an increase in discounts and rebates, partially offset by an increase in market share. 20 During 2018, the Company advanced its pipeline with several regulatory submissions and approvals for new drugs and additional indications for existing drugs as follows: Product Name          (Chemical Name) Indication US  Approval EU  Approval US Filing EU Filing DARZALEX ® (daratumumab) Frontline multiple myeloma transplant ineligible patients in combination with bortezomib, melphalan, and prednisone Ÿ Ÿ erdafitinib Treatment of locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer Ÿ ERLEADA™                         (apalutamide) Treatment of non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer Ÿ Ÿ esketamine Antidepressant for treatment-resistant depression in adults Ÿ Ÿ IMBRUVICA ® (ibrutinib) Treatment of Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia used in combination with rituximab Ÿ Ÿ Treatment for previously untreated Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia in combination with obinutuzumab Ÿ Ÿ INVOKANA ® (canagliflozin) Reduce the risk of death in type 2 diabetes with established, or risk for, cardiovascular disease.

U.S. sales were $21.5 billion, an increase of 6.7%.  International sales were $14.8 billion, an increase of 10.8%, which included 10.1% operational growth and a positive currency impact of 0.7%.  In 2017, acquisitions and divestitures had a net positive impact of 3.8% on the operational sales growth of the worldwide Pharmaceutical segment. Adjustments to previous reserve estimates, as compared to the prior year, negatively impacted the reported Pharmaceutical segment operational growth by approximately 1.8%, primarily in the Immunology and Cardiovascular/Metabolism/Other therapeutic areas. 21 Medical Devices Segment The Medical Devices segment sales in 2018 were $27.0 billion, an increase of 1.5% from 2017, which included an operational increase of 1.1% and a positive currency impact of 0.4%. U.S. sales were $12.8 billion, an increase of 0.1% as compared to the prior year.  International sales were $14.2 billion, an increase of 2.8% as compared to the prior year, with an operational increase of 1.9% and a positive currency impact of 0.9%.  In 2018, acquisitions and divestitures had a net negative impact of 1.5% on the worldwide operational sales growth of the Medical Devices segment as compared to 2017.

Growth in Advanced Surgery was primarily driven by endocutter, biosurgery and energy products. Growth in General Surgery was primarily driven by wound care products. Growth in Specialty Surgery was primarily driven by Advanced Sterilization Products. The Orthopaedics franchise sales were $8.9 billion in 2018, a decrease of 1.9% from 2017.  The decline in Spine & Other was primarily due to the Codman Neurosurgery divestiture and share loss in Spine partially offset by new product launches. The decline in knees was primarily due to competitive pressure in the U.S. partially offset by growth in Asia Pacific. Growth in hips and trauma was due to continued uptake of new products. The Vision franchise achieved sales of $4.6 billion in 2018, an increase of 12.1% from 2017. Growth was primarily driven by strength of the astigmatism and daily disposable lenses in the OASYS ® contact lenses category. Surgical growth was driven by cataract performance primarily outside the U.S. The Interventional Solutions franchise (includes the Cerenovus business previously included in Spine and Other in Orthopaedics) sales were $2.6 billion, an increase of 15.2% from 2017.  Strong growth in the electrophysiology business was driven by Atrial Fibrillation procedure growth and continued uptake of the THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH ® Contact Force Sensing Catheter. The Diabetes Care franchise sales were $1.0 billion, a decrease of 37.5% from 2017.  The decline was primarily due to divestiture of its LifeScan business in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2018 and the Company's decision to exit the Animas insulin pump business in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2017. The Medical Devices segment sales in 2017 were $26.6 billion, an increase of 5.9% from 2016, which included an operational increase of 5.7% and a positive currency impact of 0.2%. U.S. sales were $12.8 billion, an increase of 4.5% as compared to the prior year.  International sales were $13.8 billion, an increase of 7.1% as compared to the prior year, with an 22 operational increase of 6.7% and a positive currency impact of 0.4%.  In 2017, acquisitions and divestitures had a net positive impact of 4.2% on the worldwide operational sales growth of the Medical Devices segment as compared to 2016. Analysis of Consolidated Earnings Before Provision for Taxes on Income Consolidated earnings before provision for taxes on income was $18.0 billion, $17.7 billion and $19.8 billion for the fiscal years ended 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. As a percent to sales, consolidated earnings before provision for taxes on income was 22.1%,  23.1%, and 27.5% in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Cost of Products Sold and Selling, Marketing and Administrative Expenses: Cost of products sold and selling, marketing and administrative expenses as a percent to sales were as follows:* % of Sales 2018 2017 2016 Cost of products sold* 33.2 % 33.3 30.3 Percent point increase/(decrease) over the prior year (0.1 ) 3.0 (0.3 ) Selling, marketing and administrative expenses* 27.6 % 28.1 27.9 Percent point increase/(decrease) over the prior year (0.5 ) 0.2 (2.2 ) *Prior years amounts were reclassified to conform to current year presentation (adoption of ASU 2017-07) In 2018, cost of products sold as a percent to sales decreased to 33.2% from 33.3% as compared to the same period a year ago primarily due to lower inventory step-up costs related to the Actelion acquisition and favorable product and segment mix driven by a higher percentage of sales from the Pharmaceutical segment. This was mostly offset by higher amortization expense primarily related to the Actelion acquisition on June 16, 2017. Intangible asset amortization expense of $4.4 billion was included in cost of products sold for 2018 as compared to $3.0 billion in 2017. There was a decrease in the percent to sales of selling, marketing and administrative expenses in 2018 as compared to the prior year, primarily due to lower costs relative to sales growth in the Pharmaceutical business and favorable segment mix. In 2017, cost of products sold as a percent to sales increased to 33.3% from 30.3% as compared to the same period a year ago. The unfavorable increase was primarily driven by $2.3 billion of higher amortization expense and charges for inventory step-up related to the recent acquisitions, primarily Actelion. Intangible asset amortization expense of $3.0 billion was included in cost of products sold for 2017 as compared to $1.2 billion in 2016. There was an increase in the percent to sales of selling, marketing and administrative expenses in 2017 as compared to the prior year, primarily due to investments in new product launches partially offset by favorable mix. 23 Research and Development Expense: Research and development expense by segment of business was as follows:* 2018 2017 2016 (Dollars in Millions) Amount % of Sales** Amount % of Sales** Amount % of Sales** Consumer $ 565 4.1 % 586 4.3 585 4.4 Pharmaceutical 8,446 20.7 8,392 23.1 7,001 20.9 Medical Devices 1,764 6.5 1,616 6.1 1,557 6.2 Total research and development expense $ 10,775 13.2 % 10,594 13.9 9,143 12.7 Percent increase/(decrease) over the prior year 1.7 % 15.9 1.6 *Prior years amounts were reclassified to conform to current year presentation (adoption of ASU 2017-07) **As a percent to segment sales Research and development activities represent a significant part of the Company's business.  These expenditures relate to the processes of discovering, testing and developing new products, upfront payments and milestones, improving existing products, as well as ensuring product efficacy and regulatory compliance prior to launch.  The Company remains committed to investing in research and development with the aim of delivering high quality and innovative products. In 2018, worldwide costs of research and development activities increased by 1.7% compared to 2017 but decreased as a percent of sales. The decrease as a percent of sales in the Pharmaceutical segment was attributable to lower costs relative to sales growth. The increased dollar spend in the Medical Devices and Pharmaceutical segments was for investment spending to advance the pipeline. In 2017, worldwide costs of research and development activities increased by 15.9% compared to 2016.  The increase as a percent of sales was primarily in the Pharmaceutical segment due to general portfolio progression as well as collaborative agreements entered into with Idorsia Ltd. and Legend Biotech. Research facilities are located in the U.S., Belgium, Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, Israel, the Netherlands, Poland, Singapore, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom with additional R&D support in over 30 other countries. In-Process Research and Development (IPR&D): In 2018, the Company recorded an IPR&D charge of $1.1 billion. Of the $1.1 billion, a partial impairment charge of $0.8 billion related to the development program of AL-8176, an investigational drug for the treatment of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) acquired with the 2014 acquisition of Alios Biopharma Inc. The impairment charge was calculated based on updated cash flow projections discounted for the inherent risk in the asset development and reflects the impact of the phase 2b clinical trial suspension, a decrease in the probability of success factors and the ongoing analysis of asset development activities. The Company continues to evaluate information with respect to the development program and will monitor the remaining $0.9 billion intangible asset for further impairment. In addition, an impairment charge of $0.3 billion was recorded for the discontinuation of the development project for an anti-thrombin antibody associated with the 2015 acquisition of XO1 Limited. In 2017, the Company recorded an IPR&D charge of $0.4 billion primarily for the discontinuation of certain development projects related to Novira which was acquired in 2015. The product development was canceled due to safety concerns. In 2016, the Company recorded an IPR&D charge of $29 million for the discontinuation of a development program related to Crucell. Other (Income) Expense, Net: Other (income) expense, net is the account where the Company records gains and losses related to the sale and write-down of certain investments in equity securities held by Johnson & Johnson Innovation - JJDC, Inc. (JJDC), unrealized gains and losses on investments, gains and losses on divestitures, certain transactional currency gains and losses, acquisition-related costs, litigation accruals and settlements, as well as royalty income. The change in other (income) expense, net for the fiscal year 2018 was an unfavorable change of $1.4 billion primarily due to litigation expense of $2.0 billion in 2018 as compared to $1.3 billion in 2017. Additionally, 2018 included unrealized losses on securities of $0.2 billion and lower realized gains of $0.4 billion related to investments in equity securities as compared to the prior year. This was partially offset by a reversal of a contingent liability of $0.2 billion and lower costs of $0.1 billion related to the Actelion and AMO acquisitions in 2018 as compared to 2017. The fiscal year of 2017 included a gain of $0.2 billion related to monetization of future royalty receivables offset by an asset impairment charge of $0.2 billion primarily related to the insulin pump business. Divestiture gains were approximately $1.2 billion in 2018 and included the LifeScan business, NIZORAL ® , RoC ® and certain non-strategic Pharmaceutical products. Divestiture gains were approximately $1.3 billion in 2017 and primarily included the Codman Neurosurgery and COMPEED ® divestitures.  Additionally, restructuring related expense in 2018 was $0.3 billion as compared to $0.4 billion 2017. The change in other (income) expense, net for the fiscal year 2017 was a favorable change of $0.3 billion due to higher gains of $0.7 billion on the sale of assets/businesses, primarily the Codman Neurosurgery and COMPEED ® divestitures, a gain of $0.2 billion related to monetization of future royalty receivables and a higher gain of $0.3 billion related to the sale of certain investments in equity securities as compared to the prior year.  This was partially offset by higher litigation expense of $0.4 billion, $0.3 billion of acquisition costs related to Actelion and AMO, an asset impairment charge of $0.2 billion primarily 24 related to the insulin pump business and a higher restructuring related charge of $0.2 billion as compared to the fiscal year 2016. Interest (Income) Expense: Interest income was higher in 2018 as compared to 2017 due to a higher average interest rate and a benefit from net investment hedging partially offset by a lower average cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance during the period. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $19.7 billion at the end of 2018, and averaged $19.0 billion as compared to the cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities total of $18.3 billion and $30.1 billion average cash balance in 2017. The decrease in the average balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was due to the use of cash for general corporate purposes, primarily the Actelion acquisition for $29.6 billion, net of cash acquired late in the fiscal second quarter of 2017. Interest expense in 2018 was higher as compared to 2017 due to a higher average debt balance. The average debt balance was $32.5 billion in 2018 versus $30.9 billion in 2017. The total debt balance at the end of 2018 was $30.5 billion as compared to $34.6 billion at the end of 2017. Interest income in 2017 increased slightly as compared to 2016 due to higher average interest rates partially offset by lower cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances during the period. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $18.3 billion at the end of 2017, and averaged $30.1 billion as compared to the $40.1 billion average cash balance in 2016. The decrease in the balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was due to the use of cash for general corporate purposes including acquisitions, primarily the Actelion acquisition for $29.6 billion, net of cash acquired. Interest expense in 2017 was higher as compared to 2016.  The average debt balance was $30.9 billion in 2017 versus $23.5 billion in 2016. The total debt balance at the end of 2017 was $34.6 billion as compared to $27.1 billion at the end of 2016. The higher debt balance of approximately $7.5 billion was primarily due to increased borrowings.  The Company increased borrowings in February and November of 2017, capitalizing on favorable terms in the capital markets. The proceeds of the borrowings were used for general corporate purposes, including the completion of the stock repurchase program. Income Before Tax by Segment Income before tax by segment of business were as follows: Income Before Tax Segment Sales Percent of Segment Sales (Dollars in Millions) 2018 2017 2018 2017 2018 2017 Consumer $ 2,320 2,524 13,853 13,602 16.7 % 18.6 Pharmaceutical 12,568 11,083 40,734 36,256 30.9 30.6 Medical Devices 4,397 5,392 26,994 26,592 16.3 20.3 Total (1) 19,285 18,999 81,581 76,450 23.6 24.9 Less: Expenses not allocated to segments (2) 1,286 1,326 Earnings before provision for taxes on income $ 17,999 17,673 81,581 76,450 22.1 % 23.1 (1) See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details. (2) Amounts not allocated to segments include interest (income) expense and general corporate (income) expense. Consumer Segment: In 2018, the Consumer segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 16.7%, versus 18.6% in 2017. The decrease in the income before tax as a percent of sales in 2018 as compared to 2017 was primarily attributable to higher litigation expense of $0.3 billion in 2018 partially offset by slower increases in expenses relative to the increase in sales. Divestiture gains for the fiscal year of 2018, which included the divestitures of NIZORAL ® and RoC ® were comparable to fiscal year of 2017.  A gain of $0.3 billion was recognized from the divestiture of NIZORAL ® . In 2017, the Consumer segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 18.6%, versus 18.3% in 2016. The increase in the income before tax as a percent of sales in 2017 as compared to 2016 was attributable to higher gains on divestitures, primarily the divestiture of COMPEED ® in 2017.  This was partially offset by higher selling, marketing and administrative expenses as compared to the prior year due to increased advertising and promotional spending and slightly higher amortization expense in 2017 related to acquisitions. Additionally, the fiscal year 2016 was negatively impacted by operations in Venezuela. Pharmaceutical Segment: In 2018, the Pharmaceutical segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 30.9% versus 30.6% in 2017. The increase in the income before tax as a percent of sales was primarily due to lower inventory step-up costs related to Actelion of $0.6 billion, favorable product mix and slower increases in expenses relative to the increase in sales, a contingent liability reversal of $0.2 billion and higher divestiture gains of $0.2 billion from divestitures of certain non-strategic Pharmaceutical products. This was partially offset by higher amortization expense of $1.3 billion primarily related to the Actelion acquisition, a higher IPR&D charge of $0.7 billion and an unrealized loss on securities of $0.2 billion as compared to 25 the prior year.  Additionally, 2017 included a gain of $0.2 billion related to monetization of future royalty receivables and a higher gain of $0.3 billion related to the sale of certain investments in equity securities. In 2017, the Pharmaceutical segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 30.6% versus 38.3% in 2016. The decrease in the income before tax as a percent of sales was primarily due to $2.3 billion of higher amortization expense and other costs related to the Actelion acquisition, higher research and development expense, a higher IPR&D charge of $0.4 billion related to Novira and lower gains on divestitures as compared to the prior year. Additionally, the fiscal year 2016 included a positive adjustment of $0.5 billion to previous reserve estimates.  This was partially offset by a gain of $0.2 billion related to monetization of future royalty receivables, a higher gain of $0.2 billion related to the sale of certain investments in equity securities and favorable product mix in 2017. Medical Devices Segment: In 2018, the Medical Devices segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 16.3% versus 20.3% in 2017. The decrease in the income before tax as a percent to sales was primarily due higher litigation expense of $1.7 billion in 2018 as compared to $1.1 billion in 2017 and higher investments in the business in 2018. Additionally, 2018 had lower divestiture gains of approximately $0.3 billion as compared to divestiture gains in 2017.  In 2018 the Company recorded a gain of $0.5 billion related to the LifeScan divestiture. This was partially offset by lower restructuring expense of $0.2 billion in 2018 as compared to 2017.  Additionally, 2017 included an asset impairment charge of $0.2 billion primarily related to the insulin pump business. In 2017, the Medical Devices segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 20.3% versus 22.2% in 2016. The decrease in the income before tax as a percent to sales was primarily due to $0.3 billion of higher amortization expense and other acquisition costs related to AMO, $0.3 billion of higher litigation, an asset impairment charge of $0.2 billion primarily related to the insulin pump business, $0.1 billion of higher restructuring and investments in new product launches as compared to the fiscal year 2016. This was partially offset by $0.8 billion higher gains in 2017 related to divestitures, primarily the divestiture of Codman Neurosurgery. Restructuring: In the first quarter of 2016, the Company announced restructuring actions in its Medical Devices segment. The Company has achieved approximately $0.7 billion of annualized pre-tax cost saving in 2018 and is on track to achieve the annualized pre-tax cost savings of $0.8 billion to $1.0 billion as outlined in the restructuring actions. The savings will provide the Company with added flexibility and resources to fund investment in new growth opportunities and innovative solutions for customers and patients. In 2018, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $462 million, of which $46 million is included in cost of products sold and $227 million is included in other (income) expense. Total project costs of approximately $2.5 billion have been recorded since the restructuring was announced. This restructuring program was completed in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2018. In the second quarter of 2018, the Company announced plans to implement actions across its global supply chain that are intended to enable the Company to focus resources and increase investments in critical capabilities, technologies and solutions necessary to manufacture and supply its product portfolio of the future, enhance agility and drive growth. The Company expects these supply chain actions will include expanding its use of strategic collaborations, and bolstering its initiatives to reduce complexity, improving cost-competitiveness, enhancing capabilities and optimizing its network.  Discussions regarding specific future actions are ongoing and are subject to all relevant consultation requirements before they are finalized. In total, the Company expects these actions to generate approximately $0.6 to $0.8 billion in annual pre-tax cost savings that will be substantially delivered by 2022. The Company expects to record pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $1.9 to $2.3 billion. The Company estimates that approximately 70% of the cumulative pre-tax costs will result in cash outlays. In 2018, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $238 million, of which $59 million is included in cost of products sold and $117 million is included in other (income) expense. See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to the restructuring programs. Provision for Taxes on Income: The worldwide effective income tax rate was 15.0% in 2018 , 92.6% in 2017 and 16.5% in 2016 . The 2018 effective tax rate decreased by 77.6% as compared to 2017. The 2017 effective tax rate was primarily driven by a provisional tax charge of approximately $13.0 billion as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 and the impact of a Belgian statutory tax rate change which increased the 2017 effective rate by 3.4%. The Company also received a benefit in 2018 from a lower U.S. statutory tax rate vs. 2017 as well as favorable adjustments to the 2017 provisional TCJA tax charge partially offset by unfavorable income tax mix and the U.S. tax on global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI). The 2017 effective tax rate increased by 76.1% as compared to 2016, primarily driven by the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) in the United States in December 2017.  The enactment of the TCJA resulted in a provisional tax charge in the fourth quarter of 2017, of approximately $13.0 billion or approximately 73.3 percentage point increase to the effective tax rate. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to the TCJA. 26 The remainder of the increase in the tax rate for 2017 was related to the remeasurement of the Company’s deferred tax assets in Belgium, as a result of changes in the Belgian statutory corporate tax rate, enacted in December 2017, offset by a tax benefit for the closure of the Company’s Animas insulin pump business. The government in Switzerland is currently considering tax reform legislation, which could have a material impact on the Company’s effective tax rate if enacted into law. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to the TCJA and income taxes. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity & Cash Flows Cash and cash equivalents were $18.1 billion at the end of 2018 as compared to $17.8 billion at the end of 2017. The primary sources and uses of cash that contributed to the $0.3 billion increase were approximately $22.2 billion of cash generated from operating activities. This was partially offset by $3.2 billion net cash used by investing activities, $18.5 billion net cash used by financing activities and $0.2 billion due to the effect on exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents. In addition, the Company had $1.6 billion in marketable securities at the end of 2018 and $0.5 billion at the end of 2017. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Cash flow from operations of $22.2 billion was the result of $15.3 billion of net earnings and $9.2 billion of non-cash expenses and other adjustments for depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation and assets write-downs, offset by $2.3 billion from net gains on sale of assets/businesses, deferred tax provision and accounts receivable allowances, $3.9 billion related to an increase in accounts receivable, inventories and other current and non-current assets and a decrease in other current and non-current liabilities. Additional sources of operating cash flow of $4.0 billion resulted from an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. The decrease in current and non-current liabilities is primarily due to the 2018 tax payment related to TCJA. Investing activities use of $3.2 billion was for additions to property, plant and equipment of $3.7 billion, the net purchase of investments primarily marketable securities of $1.3 billion, acquisitions, net of cash acquired of $0.9 billion (primarily the acquisitions of Zarbee's) and other uses of $0.5 billion. This was partially offset by $3.2 billion of proceeds from the disposal of assets/businesses (primarily the divestiture of LifeScan). Financing activities use of $18.5 billion was primarily for dividends to shareholders of $9.5 billion, $5.9 billion for the repurchase of common stock, $3.9 billion for the net retirement of short and long-term debt and $0.2 billion of other financing. Financing activities also included sources of $1.0 billion of proceeds from stock options exercised/employee withholding tax on stock awards, net. On December 17, 2018, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program, authorizing the Company to purchase up to $5.0 billion of the Company's shares of common stock. The repurchase program has no time limit and may be suspended for periods or discontinued at any time. Any shares acquired will be available for general corporate purposes. The Company intends to finance the share repurchase program through available cash. As of December 30, 2018, $0.9 billion has been repurchased under the program. As of December 30, 2018, the Company's notes payable and long-term debt was in excess of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. As of December 30, 2018, the net debt position was $10.8 billion as compared to the prior year of $16.3 billion. There was a decrease in the net debt position due to retirement of debt. The debt balance at the end of 2018 was $30.5 billion as compared to $34.6 billion in 2017. Additionally there was a higher cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance at the end of 2018. In 2018, the Company continued to have access to liquidity through the commercial paper market.  Additionally, as a result of the TCJA, the Company has access to its cash outside the U.S. at a significantly reduced cost. The Company anticipates that operating cash flows, the ability to raise funds from external sources, borrowing capacity from existing committed credit facilities and access to the commercial paper markets will continue to provide sufficient resources to fund operating needs for the next twelve months. The Company monitors the global capital markets on an ongoing basis and from time to time may raise capital when market conditions are favorable.  The Company filed a new shelf registration on February 27, 2017 which will enable it to issue debt securities on a timely basis.  For additional details on borrowings, see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Financing and Market Risk The Company uses financial instruments to manage the impact of foreign exchange rate changes on cash flows. Accordingly, the Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to protect the value of certain foreign currency assets and liabilities and to hedge future foreign currency transactions primarily related to product costs.  Gains or losses on these contracts are offset by the gains or losses on the underlying transactions.  A 10% appreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the December 30, 2018 market rates would increase the unrealized value of the Company’s forward contracts by $57 million.  Conversely, a 10% depreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the December 30, 2018 market rates would decrease the unrealized value of the Company’s forward contracts by $69 million.  In either scenario, the gain or loss on the forward contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction, and therefore, would have no impact on future anticipated earnings and cash flows. 27 The Company hedges the exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and the effect on certain assets and liabilities in foreign currency, by entering into currency swap contracts.  A 1% change in the spread between U.S. and foreign interest rates on the Company’s interest rate sensitive financial instruments would either increase or decrease the unrealized value of the Company’s swap contracts by approximately $226 million.  In either scenario, at maturity, the gain or loss on the swap contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction, and therefore, would have no impact on future anticipated cash flows. The Company does not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Further, the Company has a policy of only entering into contracts with parties that have at least an investment grade credit rating.  The counter-parties to these contracts are major financial institutions and there is no significant concentration of exposure with any one counter-party. Management believes the risk of loss is remote. During the fiscal second quarter of 2017, the Company entered into credit support agreements (CSA) with certain derivative counterparties establishing collateral thresholds based on respective credit ratings and netting agreements. The Company invests in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities which carry a degree of interest rate risk. The fair market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall.  A 1% (100 basis points) change in spread on the Company’s interest rate sensitive investments would either increase or decrease the unrealized value of cash equivalents and current marketable securities by approximately $8 million. The Company has access to substantial sources of funds at numerous banks worldwide.  In September 2018, the Company secured a new 364-day Credit Facility. Total credit available to the Company approximates $10 billion, which expires on September 12, 2019.  Interest charged on borrowings under the credit line agreement is based on either bids provided by banks, the prime rate or London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR), plus applicable margins. Commitment fees under the agreement are not material. Total borrowings at the end of 2018 and 2017 were $30.5 billion and $34.6 billion, respectively. The decrease in borrowings was due to the retirement of debt in 2018. In 2018, net debt (cash and current marketable securities, net of debt) was $10.8 billion compared to net debt of $16.3 billion in 2017. Total debt represented 33.8% of total capital (shareholders’ equity and total debt) in 2018 and 36.5% of total capital in 2017. Shareholders’ equity per share at the end of 2018 was $22.44 compared to $22.43 at year-end 2017 . A summary of borrowings can be found in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Contractual Obligations and Commitments The Company’s contractual obligations are primarily for the recently enacted tax legislation, leases, debt and unfunded retirement plans.  There are no other significant obligations. To satisfy these obligations, the Company will use cash from operations.  The following table summarizes the Company’s contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as of December 30, 2018 (see Notes 7, 8, 10 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details): (Dollars in Millions) Tax Legislation (TCJA) Debt Obligations Interest on Debt Obligations Unfunded Retirement Plans Operating Leases Total 2019 $ — 2,636 949 92 223 3,900 2020 531 1,098 886 95 188 2,798 2021 812 1,796 841 101 154 3,704 2022 812 2,134 796 108 116 3,966 2023 1,522 1,553 764 115 76 4,030 After 2023 4,565 21,103 8,850 697 139 35,354 Total $ 8,242 30,320 13,086 1,208 896 53,752 For tax matters, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Dividends The Company increased its dividend in 2018 for the 56th consecutive year.  Cash dividends paid were $3.54 per share in 2018 compared with dividends of $3.32 per share in 2017 , and $3.15 per share in 2016 . 28 Other Information Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
