fees . Operating income in 2012 included a $30 million charge related to a contribution to certain of the Company’s bank-managed short-term investment funds (“STIFs”). Non-operating income (expense), less net income
(loss) attributable to non-controlling interests) increased $80 million due to higher net positive marks on investments in 2012 compared with 2011, partially offset by higher interest expense resulting from long-term debt issuances in May 2012 and
May 2011. In 2012, income tax expense included a $21 million benefit related to the resolution of certain outstanding tax positions and a $50 million net non-cash benefit related to the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities
including tax legislation enacted in the United Kingdom and the state and local income tax effect resulting from changes in the Company’s organizational structure. In 2011, income tax expenses included a $24 million benefit related to the
resolution of certain outstanding tax positions and $198 million of net non-cash tax benefits due to a state tax election and enacted U.K., Japan, U.S. state and local tax legislation. Earnings per diluted common share rose $1.42 from 2011 due to
higher net income and the benefit of share repurchases. During 2012, the Company repurchased 9.1 million shares. As Adjusted . Operating income of $3,574 million and operating margin of 40.4% increased $182 million and 70 bps, respectively, from 2011 reflecting higher revenues. Operating income on an as adjusted basis excluded non-GAAP expense adjustments totaling $50
million in 2012 and $143 million in 2011. Non-operating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests) increased $71 million. Income tax expense on an as adjusted basis excluded the $50 million and $198 million
non-cash benefits for 2012 and 2011, respectively, described above. Earnings per diluted common share rose $1.83 from 2011 reflecting the improvement in net income and the benefit of share repurchases. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further information on as adjusted items. 2011 Compared with 2010. GAAP. Operating income of $3,249 million and operating margin of 35.8%
increased $251 million and 100 bps, respectively, from 2010 reflecting higher base fees and higher BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue, partially offset by lower performance fees and higher operating expenses related to business
growth . Operating income and operating margin in 2011 also reflected $63 million of U.K. lease exit costs related to the Company’s exit from two London locations and $32 million of restructuring charges. Results for 2010 included $90 million of Barclays Global Investors (“BGI”) integration costs. Non-operating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to
non-controlling interests) decreased $152 million due to lower net positive marks on investments compared with 2010 and higher interest expense resulting from long-term debt issuances in May 2011. Income tax expense in 2011 included the previously
mentioned $24 million benefit and $198 million of net non-cash tax benefits. In 2010, income tax expense included a $30 million net non-cash benefit related to the revaluation of certain net deferred income tax liabilities primarily related to
acquired intangible assets due to enacted U.K. tax legislation. In addition, 2010 included the effect of favorable tax rulings and the resolution of certain outstanding tax positions. Earnings per diluted common share rose $1.82 from 2010. As Adjusted. Operating income of $3,392 million and operating margin of 39.7% increased $225 million and 40 bps, respectively, from 2010
reflecting higher revenues, partially offset by net increases in operating expenses as discussed above. Operating income on an as adjusted basis excluded non-GAAP expense adjustments totaling $143 million in 2011 and $169 million in 2010.
Non-operating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests) decreased $138 million. Income tax expense on an as adjusted basis excluded the $198 million and $30 million non-cash benefits in 2011 and 2010,
respectively, described above. Earnings per diluted common share rose $0.91 from 2010. For further discussion of BlackRock’s revenue, expenses,
non-operating results and income tax expense, see Discussion of Financial Results herein. Business Outlook BlackRock offers clients a broad range of equity, fixed income, multi-asset and alternative investment products designed to track various indices (beta), achieve
returns in excess of specified benchmarks (alpha) or deliver absolute returns. The diversity of BlackRock’s investment platform, across asset classes, investment styles and geographies – combined with world-class risk management, analytics
and advisory expertise – positions the Company well to meet the needs of clients in 2013 and beyond and to continue to attract asset flows as investor needs and sentiment evolve. BlackRock ended 2012 with record assets under management (“AUM”) of $3.792 trillion as clients sought efficient tools and innovative solutions to meet their investment objectives over both the short and
long term. The Company experienced strong client demand for exchange traded funds and products (“ETFs” and “ETPs”, respectively), alternative and emerging market investment products, high-yielding income strategies,
outcome-oriented solutions and retirement-related products, and the Company expects this demand to continue into 2013. 37 Table of Contents In early 2013, BlackRock continues to see signs of an improving global economy. While this offers the potential for
greater financial market stability, political and regulatory dynamics, persistent low interest rates and protracted periods of heightened volatility will continue to pose challenges in the investment landscape. BlackRock will continue to monitor
these factors actively in 2013, along with global credit and monetary policies (including quantitative easing and the direction of interest rates) and their effects on corporate earnings growth. While investing for stable income remains a core objective for many of its clients, BlackRock expects clients – particularly in its institutional business
– to trend towards barbelling their risk profile through the combination of active and index strategies and the use of alternative and multi-asset investment solutions, complemented with access to BlackRock’s risk management tools and
advisory services. AUM and Flows • BlackRock’s unique combination of index and active capabilities positions the Company well to help underfunded corporate and public pension plans narrow the
gap between their assets and liabilities with barbell strategies that use a combination of index, alpha, multi-asset and alternative products. As responsibility for retirement funding continues to move away from defined benefit plans into defined
contributions plans and ultimately to individuals, BlackRock is also well positioned to offer individual investment options through its LifePath ® target date
portfolios and a wide array of ETFs and other mutual fund products. • BlackRock has a leading global market share in ETPs through iShares, which leads the industry in AUM and the number of products offered in various
markets. The industry’s global growth reflects both continued adoption of ETFs by institutional and retail investors and the introduction of new products. ETP asset growth has historically been linked to positive markets, with investors looking
to capitalize on strong market returns. In the continued environment of ultra-low interest rates, industry flows shifted in 2012 toward fixed income products and, within equities, to developed markets. BlackRock believes there is opportunity in
emerging markets and is well positioned to grow its active franchise in these markets, including China. While more asset managers may enter the marketplace and offer similar products at lower fees, BlackRock believes that many factors beyond price
influence investor preferences. These preferences are driven to varying degrees by performance (as measured by tracking error, or the difference between net returns on the ETP and the corresponding targeted index), liquidity (the bid-ask spread), tax-efficiency, transparency and client service. • BlackRock believes alternative investments will continue to become more important for both institutional and retail clients seeking higher returns through
alpha-generating products. Several of BlackRock’s single strategy hedge funds are top performers in the industry and are well positioned to grow in 2013. • Cash management assets may decline from year-end levels if clients begin to re-risk their portfolios in the search for yield or equity return opportunities amid
continued low interest rates, including in the United States where the Federal Reserve expects rates to remain low until 2014. BlackRock’s diversified global product offerings, record of client service and independent advisory capabilities may
enable it to retain a portion of these assets. Regulatory Reform • BlackRock will continue to monitor the evolving regulatory landscape and to assess its influence on the competitive environment, including on liquidity and
trading costs, which may present risks as well as opportunities for BlackRock and its clients. Performance fees and BRS/advisory
fees • BlackRock improved investment performance in key areas such as fixed income and scientific active equity in 2012 and strong investment performance will again be
a priority in 2013. Higher market levels and investment performance may continue to enable the Company’s alternative investment products to contribute additional performance fee revenue. • BlackRock expects continuing strong global demand for its Aladdin operating platform and its comprehensive risk reporting capabilities from sophisticated
institutional investors and governmental agencies investing in longer-term risk management solutions. The Company also expects to see continuing strong demand for its BlackRock Solutions financial markets advisory services. Future opportunities • BlackRock intends to continue to invest in its people, its platform and its global brand. The Company will continue to build out its product offering and
geographic presence, including in emerging markets, and to grow its iShares franchise, both through organic growth and targeted acquisitions. 38 Table of Contents Non-GAAP Financial Measures BlackRock reports its financial results in accordance with GAAP; however, management believes evaluating the Company’s ongoing operating results may be enhanced if investors have additional non-GAAP basis
financial measures. Management reviews non-GAAP financial measures to assess ongoing operations and, for the reasons described below, considers them to be effective indicators, for both management and investors, of BlackRock’s financial
performance over time. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Computations for all periods are derived from the consolidated statements of income as follows: (a) Operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted: Operating income, as adjusted, equals operating income, GAAP basis, excluding certain items management deems non-recurring, or transactions that ultimately will not impact BlackRock’s book value, as indicated
in the table below. Operating income used for operating margin measurement equals operating income, as adjusted, excluding the impact of closed-end fund launch costs and commissions. Operating margin, as adjusted, equals operating income used for
operating margin measurement, divided by revenue (net of distribution and servicing costs and amortization of deferred sales commissions) used for operating margin measurement, as indicated in the table below. (Dollar amounts in millions) 2012 2011 2010 Operating income, GAAP basis $ 3,524 $ 3,249 $ 2,998 Non-GAAP expense adjustments: BGI transaction/integration costs Employee compensation and benefits — — 25 General and administration — — 65 Total BGI transaction/integration costs — — 90 U.K. lease exit costs (8 ) 63 — Contribution to STIFs 30 — — Restructuring charges — 32 — PNC LTIP funding obligation 22 44 58 Merrill Lynch compensation contribution — 7 10 Compensation expense related to appreciation (depreciation) on deferred compensation plans 6 (3 ) 11 Operating income, as adjusted 3,574 3,392 3,167 Closed-end fund launch costs 22 26 15 Closed-end fund launch commissions 3 3 2 Operating income used for operating margin measurement $ 3,599 $ 3,421 $ 3,184 Revenue, GAAP basis $ 9,337 $ 9,081 $ 8,612 Non-GAAP adjustments: Distribution and servicing costs (364 ) (386 ) (408 ) Amortization of deferred sales commissions (55 ) (81 ) (102 ) Revenue used for operating margin measurement $ 8,918 $ 8,614 $ 8,102 Operating margin, GAAP basis 37.7 % 35.8 % 34.8 % Operating margin, as adjusted 40.4 % 39.7 % 39.3 % Management believes operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are effective indicators of
BlackRock’s financial performance over time and, therefore, provide useful disclosure to investors. Operating income, as adjusted: Operating income, as adjusted reflects non-GAAP expense adjustments. BGI transaction and integration costs consisted principally of compensation
expense, legal fees, marketing and promotional, occupancy and consulting expenses incurred in conjunction with the BGI acquisition from Barclays. U.K. lease exit costs represent costs to exit two locations in London in the third quarter 2011. The amount in 2012
represents an adjustment related to the estimated costs initially recorded in third quarter 2011. The contribution to STIFs represents a one-time contribution to certain of the Company’s bank-managed STIFs (see Liquidity and Capital
Resources for more information). Restructuring charges consist of compensation costs and professional fees. 39 Table of Contents The portion of compensation expense associated with certain long-term incentive plans (“LTIP”) funded or to
be funded through share distributions to participants of BlackRock stock held by PNC and a Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. (“Merrill Lynch”) cash compensation contribution, has been excluded because it ultimately does not impact
BlackRock’s book value. The expense related to the Merrill Lynch cash compensation contribution ceased at the end of third quarter 2011. As of first quarter 2012, all of the Merrill Lynch contributions had been received. Compensation expense associated with appreciation (depreciation) on investments related to certain BlackRock deferred compensation plans has been excluded as
returns on investments set aside for these plans, which substantially offset this expense, are reported in non-operating income (expense). Management
believes operating income exclusive of these items is a useful measure in evaluating BlackRock’s operating performance and helps enhance the comparability of this information for the reporting periods presented. Operating margin, as adjusted: Operating income used for
measuring operating margin, as adjusted, is equal to operating income, as adjusted, excluding the impact of closed-end fund launch costs and commissions. Management believes the exclusion of such costs and commissions is useful because these costs
can fluctuate considerably and revenues associated with the expenditure of these costs will not fully impact the Company’s results until future periods. Operating margin, as adjusted, allows the Company to compare performance from period-to-period by adjusting for items that may not recur, recur infrequently or may have an economic offset in non-operating income
(expense). Examples of such adjustments include BGI transaction and integration costs, U.K. lease exit costs, contribution to STIFs, restructuring charges, closed-end fund launch costs, commissions paid to certain employees as compensation and
fluctuations in compensation expense based on mark-to-market movements in investments held to fund certain compensation plans. The Company also uses operating margin, as adjusted, to monitor corporate performance and efficiency and as a benchmark to
compare its performance with other companies. Management uses both the GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating the financial performance of BlackRock. The non-GAAP measure by itself may pose limitations because it does not include all of
the Company’s revenues and expenses. Revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, excludes distribution and servicing costs paid to related parties and
other third parties. Management believes the exclusion of such costs is useful because it creates consistency in the treatment for certain contracts for similar services, which due to the terms of the contracts, are accounted for under GAAP on a net
basis within investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue. Amortization of deferred sales commissions is excluded from revenue used for operating margin measurement, as adjusted, because such costs, over time,
substantially offset distribution fee revenue earned by the Company. For each of these items, BlackRock excludes from revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, the costs related to each of these items as a proxy for such offsetting revenues. (b) Non-operating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests, as adjusted: Non-operating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, is presented below. The compensation expense offset is recorded in
operating income. This compensation expense has been included in non-operating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, to offset returns on investments set aside for these plans, which are reported in non-operating
income (expense), GAAP basis. (Dollar amounts in millions) 2012 2011 2010 Non-operating income (expense), GAAP basis $ (54 ) $ (114 ) $ 23 Less: Net income (loss) attributable to NCI (18 ) 2 (13 ) Non-operating income (expense) (1) (36 ) (116 ) 36 Compensation expense related to (appreciation) depreciation on deferred compensation plans (6 ) 3 (11 ) Non-operating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted $ (42 ) $ (113 ) $ 25 (1) Net of net income (loss) attributable to NCI. Management believes non-operating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, provides comparability of this information among
reporting periods and is an effective measure for reviewing BlackRock’s non-operating contribution to its results. As compensation expense associated with (appreciation) depreciation on investments related to certain deferred compensation
plans, which is included in operating income, substantially offsets the gain (loss) on the investments set aside for these plans, management 40 Table of Contents believes non-operating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, provides a useful measure, for both management and investors, of BlackRock’s non-operating
results that impact book value. (c) Net income attributable to BlackRock, as adjusted: Management believes net income attributable to BlackRock, as adjusted, and diluted earnings per common share, as adjusted, are useful measures of BlackRock’s profitability and financial performance. Net income attributable to BlackRock, as adjusted, equals net income attributable to
BlackRock, GAAP basis, adjusted for significant non-recurring items, charges that ultimately will not impact BlackRock’s book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow. (Dollar amounts in millions, except per share data) 2012 2011 2010 Net income attributable to BlackRock, GAAP basis $ 2,458 $ 2,337 $ 2,063 Non-GAAP adjustments, net of tax: (d) BGI transaction/integration costs — — 59 U.K. lease exit costs (5 ) 43 — Contribution to STIFs 21 — — Restructuring charges — 22 — PNC LTIP funding obligation 14 30 40 Merrill Lynch compensation contribution — 5 7 Income tax law changes/election (50 ) (198 ) (30 ) Net income attributable to BlackRock, as adjusted $ 2,438 $ 2,239 $ 2,139 Allocation of net income, as adjusted, to common

adjusted (f) $ 13.68 $ 11.85 $ 10.94 See note (a) Operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, for information on BGI transaction/integration
costs, U.K. lease exit costs, contribution to STIFs, restructuring charges, PNC LTIP funding obligation and Merrill Lynch compensation contribution. During 2012, income tax changes included adjustments related to the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities due to tax legislation enacted in the
United Kingdom and the state and local income tax effect resulting from changes in the Company’s organizational structure. During 2011 and 2010, income tax changes included adjustments related to the revaluation of certain deferred income tax
liabilities due to a state tax election and enacted U.K., Japan, U.S. state and local tax legislation. The resulting decrease in income taxes has been excluded from net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, as these items do not have
a cash flow impact and to ensure comparability among periods presented. (d) In 2012, 2011 and 2010 non-GAAP adjustments were tax effected at 31.4%, 31.8% and 33%, respectively, reflecting a blended rate applicable to the adjustments. (e) Amounts exclude net income attributable to participating securities (see below). (f) Non-voting participating preferred shares are considered to be common stock equivalents for purposes of determining basic and diluted earnings per share calculations. Certain
unvested RSUs are not included in diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding as they are deemed participating securities in accordance with required provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 260-10, Earnings per
Share .

third quarter 2012, respectively. (3) Advisory AUM represents long-term portfolio liquidation assignments. (4) Amounts include outflows due to manager concentration considerations prior to third quarter 2011 and outflows from scientific active equity performance prior to
second quarter 2011. As a result of client investment manager concentration limits and the scientific active equity performance, outflows were expected to occur for a period of time subsequent to the close of the transaction. (5) Amounts include AUM acquired from Swiss Re Private Equity Partners (the “SRPEP Transaction”) in September 2012 of $6.2 billion, the Claymore
Investments, Inc. acquisition (the “Claymore Transaction”) in March 2012 of $7.6 billion and BGI acquisition adjustments in 2010 of $6.2 billion. (6) Foreign exchange reflects the impact of converting non-U.S. dollar denominated AUM into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. BlackRock has historically grown aggregate AUM through organic growth and acquisitions. Management believes that the Company will be able to continue to grow AUM
by focusing on strong investment performance, the efficient delivery of beta for index products, client service, by developing new products and new distribution capabilities and by continuing appropriate acquisitions.

institutional index fixed income outflows of $36.0 billion and $74.2 billion. (2) Amounts represent AUM acquired in the SRPEP Transaction in September 2012 of $6.2 billion and Claymore Transaction in March 2012 of $7.6 billion. (3) Foreign exchange reflects the impact of converting non-U.S. dollar denominated AUM into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. (4) Amounts include commodity iShares . (5) Advisory AUM represents long-term portfolio liquidation assignments. AUM increased $278.9 billion, or 8%, to $3.792 trillion at December 31, 2012 from $3.513 trillion at
December 31, 2011. The increase in AUM was driven largely by market gains and positive net new business, excluding the effect of two single client low-fee, institutional index fixed income outflows of $36.0 billion and $74.2 billion in first
quarter 2012 and third quarter 2012, respectively. Total flows included $74.5 billion of planned advisory distributions and acquired AUM related to the SRPEP and the Claymore Transactions of $13.7 billion. Net market appreciation of $321.4 billion reflected growth in U.S. and global equity markets and $67.8 billion
appreciation in fixed income products across the majority of strategies. The $15.7 billion net increase in AUM from converting non-U.S. dollar
denominated AUM into U.S. dollars was primarily due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the pound sterling and the euro, partially offset by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen. The following table presents the component

(2) Amounts include outflows due to manager concentration considerations prior to third quarter 2011 and outflows from scientific active equity performance prior to
second quarter 2011 of $28.3 billion. As a result of client investment manager concentration limits and the scientific active equity performance, outflows were expected to occur for a period of time subsequent to the close of the transaction. (3) Foreign exchange reflects the impact of converting non-U.S. dollar denominated AUM into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. (4) Amounts include commodity iShares . (5) Advisory AUM represents long-term portfolio liquidation assignments. 44 Table of Contents AUM decreased approximately $48.3 billion, or 1%, to $3.513 trillion at December 31, 2011 from $3.561 trillion
at December 31, 2010. The decline in AUM was primarily attributable to $34.6 billion in net market and foreign exchange valuation declines, $29.9 billion of advisory distributions and $22.9 billion of cash management net outflows, partially
offset by $67.3 billion of long-term net new business, before giving effect to the final BGI merger-related outflows of $28.3 billion recorded in the first half of 2011. Net market depreciation of $27.5 billion included $128.1 billion of depreciation in equity products resulting from the decline in global equity, partially offset by appreciation in fixed income products of $100.7
billion. The $7.1 billion net decrease in AUM from converting non-U.S. dollar denominated AUM into U.S. dollars was primarily due to the strengthening
of the U.S. dollar against the euro, pound sterling and Canadian dollar, partially offset by weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen. Discussion of Financial Results Introduction BlackRock derives a substantial portion of its revenue from investment advisory and administration fees, which are recognized as the services are
performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre-determined percentages of the market value of AUM or percentages of committed capital during investment periods of certain alternative products and are affected by changes in AUM, including market
appreciation or depreciation, foreign exchange translation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Net subscriptions or redemptions represent the sum of new client assets, additional fundings from existing clients (including dividend reinvestment),
withdrawals of assets from, and termination of, client accounts and distributions to investors representing return of capital and return on investments to investors. Market appreciation or depreciation includes current income earned on, and changes
in the fair value of, securities held in client accounts. Foreign exchange translation reflects the impact of converting non-U.S. dollar denominated AUM into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. BlackRock also earns revenue by lending securities on behalf of clients, primarily to brokerage institutions. The securities loaned are secured by collateral in
the form of cash or securities, with minimum collateral generally ranging from approximately 102% to 112% of the value of the loaned securities. The revenue earned is shared between BlackRock and the funds or other third-party accounts managed by
the Company from which the securities are borrowed. Historically, securities lending revenue in the second quarter exceeds the other quarters during the year. Investment advisory agreements for certain separate accounts and investment funds provide for performance fees, based upon relative and/or absolute investment performance, in addition to base fees based on AUM.
Investment advisory performance fees generally are earned after a given period of time and when investment performance exceeds a contractual threshold. As such, the timing of recognition of performance fees may increase the volatility of
BlackRock’s revenue and earnings. Historically, the magnitude of performance fees in the third and fourth quarters generally exceeds the first two calendar quarters in a year due to the greater number of products with performance measurement
periods that end on either September 30 or December 31. BlackRock provides a variety of risk management, investment
analytic and investment system and advisory services to financial institutions, pension funds, asset managers, foundations, consultants, mutual fund sponsors, real estate investment trusts and government agencies. These services are provided under
the brand name BlackRock Solutions and include a wide array of risk management services, valuation services related to illiquid securities, disposition and workout assignments (including long-term portfolio liquidation assignments), strategic
planning and execution, and enterprise investment system outsourcing to clients. Approximately $14 trillion of positions are processed on the Company’s Aladdin ® operating platform, which serves as the investment/risk solutions system for BlackRock and other institutional investors. Fees earned for BlackRock
Solutions and advisory services are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i) percentages of various attributes of advisory AUM or value of positions on the Aladdin platform, (ii) fixed fees and
(iii) performance fees if contractual thresholds are met. BlackRock builds upon its leadership position to meet the growing need for investment
and risk management solutions. Through its scale and diversity of products, it is able to provide its clients with customized solutions including fiduciary outsourcing for liability-driven investments and overlay strategies for pension plan
sponsors, balance sheet management and related services for insurance companies and target date and target return funds, as well as asset allocation portfolios, for retail investors. BlackRock is also able to service these clients via its Aladdin platform to provide risk management and other outsourcing services for institutional investors and custom and tailored solutions to address complex risk exposures. 45 Table of Contents The Company earns fees for transition management services comprised of commissions from acting as an introducing
broker-dealer in buying and selling securities on behalf of its customers. Commissions related to transition management services are recorded on a trade-date basis as securities transactions occur. The Company also earns revenue related to operating advisory company investments accounted for as equity method investments. Operating expenses reflect employee compensation and benefits, distribution and servicing costs, amortization of deferred sales commissions, direct fund expenses,
general and administration expenses and amortization of finite-lived intangible assets. • Employee compensation and benefits expense includes salaries, commissions, temporary help, deferred and incentive compensation, employer payroll taxes, severance
and related benefit costs. • Distribution and servicing costs, which are primarily AUM driven, include payments made to Merrill Lynch-affiliated entities under a global distribution
agreement, to PNC and Barclays, as well as other third parties, primarily associated with obtaining and retaining client investments in certain BlackRock products. • Direct fund expenses primarily consist of third-party non-advisory expenses incurred by BlackRock related to certain funds for the use of index trademarks,
reference data for indices, custodial services, fund administration, fund accounting, transfer agent services, shareholder reporting services, legal expenses, audit and tax services as well as other fund-related expenses directly attributable to the
non-advisory operations of the fund. These expenses may vary over time with fluctuations in AUM, number of shareholder accounts, or other attributes directly related to volume of business. • General and administration expenses include marketing and promotional, occupancy and office-related costs, portfolio services (including clearing expenses
related to transition management services), technology, professional services, communications, closed-end fund launch costs and other general and administration expenses, including the impact of foreign currency remeasurement. Non-operating income (expense) includes the effect of changes in the valuations on investments (excluding available-for-sale
investments) and earnings on equity method investments, as well as interest and dividend income and interest expense. Other comprehensive income includes changes in valuations related to available-for-sale investments. BlackRock primarily holds seed
and co-investments in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes, including private equity, distressed credit/mortgage debt securities, hedge funds and real estate. Investments generally are made for co-investment
purposes, to establish a performance track record, to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans or for regulatory purposes, including Federal Reserve Bank stock. BlackRock does not engage in proprietary trading activities that could
conflict with the interests of its clients. In addition, non-operating income (expense) includes the impact of changes in the valuations of
consolidated sponsored investment funds and consolidated collateralized loan obligations (“CLOs”). The portion of non-operating income (expense) not attributable to BlackRock is allocated to NCI on the consolidated statements of income. 46 Table of Contents Revenue Variance (Dollar amounts in millions) 2012 2011 2010 2012 vs. 2011 2011 vs. 2010 Investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue: Equity: Active $ 1,753 $ 1,967 $ 1,848 $ (214 ) $ 119 iShares 1,941 1,847 1,660 94 187 Fixed income: Active 1,182 1,104 1,047 78 57 iShares 441 317 263 124 54 Multi-asset class 957 894 740 63 154 Alternatives: Core 525 557 522 (32 ) 35 Currency and commodities 131 136 110 (5 ) 26 Sub-total 6,930 6,822 6,190 108 632 Non-ETF Index: Equity 552 488 424 64 64 Fixed income 229 203 166 26 37 Sub-total Non-ETF Index 781 691 590 90 101 Long-term 7,711 7,513 6,780 198 733 Cash management 361 383 510 (22 ) (127 ) Total base fees 8,072 7,896 7,290 176 606 Investment advisory performance fees: Equity 88 145 123 (57 ) 22 Fixed income 48 35 55 13 (20 ) Multi-asset class 15 20 33 (5 ) (13 ) Alternatives 312 171 329 141 (158 ) Total 463 371 540 92 (169 ) BlackRock Solutions and advisory 518 510 460 8 50 Distribution fees 71 100 116 (29 ) (16 ) Other revenue 213 204 206 9 (2 ) Total revenue $ 9,337 $ 9,081 $ 8,612 $ 256 $ 469 The table below lists the asset type mix of investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue (collectively

fees represented 39% of total average AUM. In 2011, non-ETF Index equity and fixed income were 9% of total base fees; however, AUM associated with these base fees represented 39% of total average AUM. 2012 Compared with 2011. Revenues increased $256
million, or 3%, in 2012 reflecting market growth, positive flows, improvements in securities lending revenue and strength in performance fees. Investment Advisory, Administration Fees and Securities Lending Revenue. Investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue
totaled $8,072 million in 2012 compared with $7,896 million in 2011. The current year reflected an improvement in securities lending revenue and higher advisory fees reflecting higher long-term average AUM. Securities lending fees were $510 million
in 2012 compared with $397 million in 2011, reflecting higher lending rates and an increase in average balances of securities on loan. Performance Fees. Investment advisory performance fees were $463 million in 2012 compared with $371 million in 2011, primarily reflecting higher
performance fees from alternative products, including fees from a disposition-related opportunistic fund, which were partially offset by lower fees from equity products. BlackRock Solutions and Advisory. BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue in 2012 increased $8 million, or 2%, from 2011, primarily due to higher revenue from Aladdin mandates partially
offset by the run off of revenues associated with a lower level of advisory assets and lower one-term revenue from advisory assignments. Distribution Fees. Distribution fees of $71 million in 2012 decreased $29 million, or 29%, from $100 million in 2011, primarily due to lower AUM
in certain share classes of BlackRock Funds . Other Revenue. Other revenue increased $9 million, largely reflecting higher
earnings from certain operating advisory company investments, partially offset by lower sales commissions and marketing fees earned for services to distribute iPath ® products. 2011 Compared with 2010. Revenues increased $469 million, or 5%, in 2011 largely reflecting a $606 million increase in total investment advisory, administration fees and
securities lending revenue, partially offset by lower performance fees of $169 million. Investment Advisory, Administration Fees and Securities
Lending Revenue. Investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue totaled $7,896 million in 2011 compared with $7,290 million in 2010. 2011 reflected an improvement in base fees primarily due to growth in long-term
average AUM, which included the benefit of net new business, partially offset by a decline in fees from cash management products due to lower average AUM and higher fee waivers. Securities lending fees were $397 million in 2011 compared with $325
million in 2010, reflecting an increase in average balances of securities on loan and higher lending rates. Performance Fees. Investment
advisory performance fees were $371 million in 2011 compared with $540 million in 2010, primarily reflecting lower performance fees from alternative strategies, including multi-strategy and single-strategy equity and fixed income hedge funds and
opportunistic funds. The decrease was partially offset by higher performance fees due to strong relative performance from regional/country and global equity strategies. BlackRock Solutions and Advisory. BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue in 2011 increased $50 million, or 11%, from 2010, largely driven by on-going and additional Aladdin mandates and
advisory assignments. Distribution Fees. Distribution fees of $100 million in 2011 decreased $16 million, or 14%, from $116 million
in 2010, primarily due to lower AUM in certain share classes of BlackRock Funds . 48 Table of Contents Expenses Variance (Dollar amounts in millions) 2012 2011 2010 2012 Vs. 2011 2011 Vs. 2010 Expenses, GAAP: Employee compensation and benefits $ 3,287 $ 3,199 $ 3,097 $ 88 $ 102 Distribution and servicing costs 364 386 408 (22 ) (22 ) Amortization of deferred sales commissions 55 81 102 (26 ) (21 ) Direct fund expenses 591 563 493 28 70 General and administration: Marketing and promotional 384 315 328 69 (13 ) Occupancy and office related 248 373 317 (125 ) 56 Portfolio services 196 189 177 7 12 Technology 150 146 152 4 (6 ) Professional services 114 139 115 (25 ) 24 Communications 39 40 49 (1 ) (9 ) Regulatory, filing and license fees 17 16 34 1 (18 ) Charitable contributions 6 7 26 (1 ) (19 ) Closed-end fund launch costs 22 26 15 (4 ) 11 Other general and administration 183 164 141 19 23 Total general and administration expenses 1,359 1,415 1,354 (56 ) 61 Restructuring charges — 32 — (32 ) 32 Amortization of intangible assets 157 156 160 1 (4 ) Total expenses, GAAP $ 5,813 $ 5,832 $ 5,614 $ (19 ) $ 218 Less non-GAAP expense adjustments: Employee compensation and benefits: BGI integration costs — — 25 — (25 ) PNC LTIP funding obligation 22 44 58 (22 ) (14 ) Merrill Lynch compensation contribution — 7 10 (7 ) (3 ) Compensation expense related to appreciation (depreciation) on deferred compensation plans 6 (3 ) 11 9 (14 ) Sub-total 28 48 104 (20 ) (56 ) General and administration: BGI integration costs — — 65 — (65 ) U.K. lease exit costs (8 ) 63 — (71 ) 63 Contribution to STIFs 30 — — 30 — Sub-total 22 63 65 (41 ) (2 ) Restructuring charges — 32 — (32 ) 32 Total non-GAAP expense adjustments 50 143 169 (93 ) (26 ) Expenses, as adjusted: Employee compensation and benefits 3,259 3,151 2,993 108 158 Distribution and servicing costs 364 386 408 (22 ) (22 ) Amortization of deferred sales commissions 55 81 102 (26 ) (21 ) Direct fund expenses 591 563 493 28 70 General and administration 1,337 1,352 1,289 (15 ) 63 Amortization of intangible assets 157 156 160 1 (4 ) Total expenses, as adjusted $ 5,763 $ 5,689 $ 5,445 $ 74 $ 244 49 Table of Contents 2012 Compared with 2011. Total GAAP expenses decreased $19 million to $5,813 million in 2012 from $5,832 million in 2011. Excluding certain items deemed non-recurring by management or transactions that ultimately will not affect the
Company’s book value, total expenses, as adjusted, increased $74 million. The increase in total expenses, as adjusted, is primarily attributable to increases in employee compensation and benefits and direct fund expenses, partially offset by a
reduction in amortization of deferred sales commissions, distribution and servicing costs and general and administration expenses. Employee
Compensation and Benefits. GAAP. Employee compensation and benefits expense increased $88 million, or 3%, to $3,287 million in 2012 from
$3,199 million in 2011. Employees at December 31, 2012 totaled approximately 10,500 compared with approximately 10,100 at December 31, 2011. As Adjusted. Employee compensation and benefits, as adjusted, increased by $108 million, reflecting a $104 million increase in incentive compensation driven
by higher operating income, including higher performance fees. Distribution and Servicing Costs. Distribution and servicing costs
decreased $22 million, or 6%, to $364 million in 2012 from $386 million in 2011. The $22 million decrease related to lower service fees from variable annuities and lower cash management-related distribution costs. These costs included payments to
Bank of America/Merrill Lynch under the global distribution agreement, PNC and Barclays, as well as other third parties, primarily associated with the distribution and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. Distribution and servicing costs for 2012 and 2011 included $195 million and $207 million, respectively, of costs attributable to Bank of America and affiliates. Amortization of Deferred Sales Commissions. Amortization of deferred sales commissions decreased $26 million, or 32%, to $55 million in
2012 from $81 million in 2011, primarily related to lower sales in certain share classes of U.S. open-end mutual funds. Direct Fund
Expenses . In 2012, direct fund expenses increased $28 million from 2011 million, primarily reflecting growth in average AUM for the funds (predominantly iShares ) where BlackRock pays certain non-advisory expenses of the funds. General and Administration Expenses. GAAP. General and administration expenses decreased $56 million, or 4%, to $1,359 million in 2012 from $1,415 million in 2011. Lower occupancy and
office-related expenses, primarily due to $63 million of U.K. lease exit costs incurred in the third quarter 2011, and lower professional services costs contributed to the overall net decrease in general and administration expenses. The decrease in
general and administration expenses was partially offset by higher marketing and promotional expenses in connection with the brand campaign and a one-time contribution to STIFs (see Liquidity and Capital Resources for more information). Non-GAAP Adjustments. In 2012, general and administration expenses included the previously mentioned contribution to STIFs. In 2011, general and
administration expenses included $63 million of U.K. lease exit costs related to the Company’s exit from two London locations. The adjustment for U.K. lease exit costs in 2012 represents an adjustment to the estimated costs initially recorded
in 2011. These amounts were excluded from as adjusted general and administrative expenses. As Adjusted. General and administration expenses, as
adjusted, of $1,337 million decreased $15 million in 2012 from $1,352 million in 2011. Lower occupancy and office-related expenses, professional fees and consulting expenses contributed to the overall decrease in as adjusted general and
administration expenses. The decrease in as adjusted general and administration expenses was partially offset by higher marketing and promotional expenses in connection with the brand campaign. 2011 Compared with 2010. Total GAAP expenses
increased $218 million, or 4%, to $5,832 million in 2011 from $5,614 million in 2010. Excluding certain items deemed non-recurring by management or transactions that ultimately will not affect the Company’s book value, total expenses, as
adjusted, increased $244 million, or 4%. The increase in total expenses, as adjusted, is primarily attributable to increases in employee compensation and benefits, direct fund expenses and general and administration expenses, partially offset by a
reduction in distribution and servicing costs and amortization of deferred sales commissions. Employee Compensation and Benefits. GAAP. Employee compensation and benefits expense increased $102 million, or 3%, to $3,199 million in 2011 from $3,097 million in 2010.
Employees at December 31, 2011 totaled approximately 10,100 compared with approximately 9,100 at December 31, 2010. 50 Table of Contents As Adjusted. Employee compensation and benefits, as adjusted, increased by $158 million, reflecting a $164
million increase in base salaries due to an increase in the number of employees and salary levels, and a $41 million increase in other compensation, including payroll taxes, benefits, and commissions. These increases were partially offset by a $47
million decrease in incentive compensation. Distribution and Servicing Costs. Distribution and servicing costs decreased $22
million, or 5%, to $386 million in 2011 from $408 million in 2010. The $22 million decrease related to lower cash management-related costs of $45 million, reflecting lower average AUM and higher yield-support waivers resulting in lower levels of
distribution costs, partially offset by higher costs due to increases in average AUM for open-end and closed-end funds, separate accounts and variable annuities. Distribution and servicing costs in 2011 included $207 million of costs attributable to Bank of America/Merrill Lynch and affiliates, and $3 million of costs attributable to PNC and affiliates compared with $246
million and $10 million, respectively, in 2010. Distribution and servicing costs related to other third parties, including Barclays, increased $24 million to $176 million in 2011 from $152 million in 2010 due to an expansion of distribution
platforms and higher long-term AUM. Amortization of Deferred Sales Commissions. Amortization of deferred sales commissions
decreased $21 million, or 21%, to $81 million in 2011 from $102 million in 2010. Lower sales in certain share classes of U.S. open-end mutual funds contributed to the decline. Direct Fund Expenses . Direct fund expenses increased $70 million reflecting growth in average AUM for the funds (predominantly iShares ) where BlackRock pays certain non-advisory expenses of the funds. General and Administration Expenses. GAAP. General and administration expenses increased $61 million, or 5%, to $1,415 million in 2011 from $1,354 million in 2010. Higher occupancy and office-related expenses (including $63 million of U.K. lease exit costs), higher professional services costs and other general and administration expenses
contributed to the overall net increase in general and administration expenses. The $23 million increase in other general and administration expenses reflected higher VAT expense and recruiting costs in 2011 offset by the non-recurrence of other
general and administration provisions recorded in 2010 related to an outstanding loan to Anthracite Capital Inc. The increase in general and administration expenses was partially offset by a decrease in charitable contributions as well as a decrease
in regulatory, filing and licenses fees, primarily due to a $20 million 2010 U.K. industry regulatory assessment. Non-GAAP Adjustments. In 2011
general and administration expenses included the previously mentioned $63 million of U.K. lease exit costs. In 2010, general and administration expenses included $65 million of BGI integration costs primarily consisting of $33 million of marketing
and promotional costs, $12 million of professional services and $12 million of occupancy costs. These amounts were excluded from as adjusted general and administrative expenses. As Adjusted. General and administration expenses, as adjusted, of $1,352 million increased $63 million, or 5%, in 2011 from $1,289 million in 2010. The increase was primarily due to higher VAT expense, an
increase in professional services costs, and higher marketing and promotional costs, partially offset by the non-recurrence of costs recorded in 2010 related to an outstanding loan to Anthracite Capital, Inc. In addition, general and administration expenses, as adjusted, reflected higher marketing and promotional costs in 2011. Restructuring Charges. In 2011, BlackRock recorded pre-tax restructuring charges of $32 million, primarily related to severance, accelerated amortization of
certain previously granted stock awards, and legal and outplacement costs, associated with a reduction in work force and reengineering efforts. 51 Table of Contents Non-operating Results Non-operating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI for 2012, 2011 and 2010 was as follows: Variance (Dollar amounts in millions) 2012 2011 2010 2012 vs. 2011 2011 vs. 2010 Non-operating income (expense), GAAP basis $ (54 ) $ (114 ) $ 23 $ 60 $ (137 ) Less: Net income (loss) attributable to NCI (1) (18 ) 2 (13 ) (20 ) 15 Non-operating income (expense) (2) (36 ) (116 ) 36 80 (152 ) Compensation expense related to (appreciation) depreciation on deferred compensation plans (6 ) 3 (11 ) (9 ) 14 Non-operating income (expense), as adjusted (2) $ (42 ) $ (113 ) $ 25 $ 71 $ (138 ) (1) Amounts included losses of $38 million, $18 million and $35 million attributable to consolidated variable interest entities for 2012, 2011 and 2010,

The components of non-operating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI for 2012, 2011 and 2010 were as follows: Variance (Dollar amounts in millions) 2012 2011 2010 2012 vs. 2011 2011 vs. 2010 Net gain (loss) on investments (1) Private equity $ 36 $ 36 $ 31 $ — $ 5 Real estate 14 10 17 4 (7 ) Distressed credit/mortgage funds 69 (13 ) 66 82 (79 ) Hedge funds/funds of hedge funds 20 (5 ) 18 25 (23 ) Other investments (2) (2 ) 1 14 (3 ) (13 ) Sub-total 137 29 146 108 (117 ) Investments related to deferred compensation plans 6 (3 ) 11 9 (14 ) Total net gain (loss) on investments 143 26 157 117 (131 ) Interest and dividend income 36 34 29 2 5 Interest expense (215 ) (176 ) (150 ) (39 ) (26 ) Net interest expense (179 ) (142 ) (121 ) (37 ) (21 ) Total non-operating income (expense) (1) (36 ) (116 ) 36 80 (152 ) Compensation expense related to (appreciation) depreciation on deferred compensation plans (6 ) 3 (11 ) (9 ) 14 Non-operating income (expense), as adjusted (1) $ (42 ) $ (113 ) $ 25 $ 71 $ (138 ) (1) Net of net income (loss) attributable to NCI. (2) Amount included net gains (losses) related to equity and fixed income investments and BlackRock’s seed capital hedging program. 2012 Compared with 2011. Net gains on investments increased $117 million from 2011 due to higher net positive marks in 2012 compared with 2011. Net interest expense increased from 2011, primarily due to long-term debt issuances in May 2011 and May 2012. For further information on the Company’s
long-term debt, see Liquidity and Capital Resources herein. 2011 Compared with 2010. Net gains on investments decreased $131 million during 2011 due to lower net positive marks in 2011 compared with 2010. Net interest expense increased $21 million, or 17%, from 2010 primarily due to long-term debt issuances in May 2011, partially offset by higher interest and dividend income. 52 Table of Contents Income Tax Expense GAAP As adjusted (Dollar amounts in millions) 2012 2011 2010 2012 2011 2010 Income before income taxes (1) $ 3,488 $ 3,133 $ 3,034 $ 3,532 $ 3,279 $ 3,192 Income tax expense $ 1,030 $ 796 $ 971 $ 1,094 $ 1,040 $ 1,053 Effective tax rate 29.5 % 25.4 % 32.0 % 31.0 % 31.7 % 33.0 % (1) Net of net income (loss) attributable to NCI. The Company’s tax rate is affected by tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the relative amount of income
earned in those jurisdictions, which the Company expects to be fairly consistent in the near term. The significant foreign jurisdictions, which have lower statutory tax rates than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35%, include the United Kingdom,
Luxembourg, Canada and the Netherlands. U.S. income taxes were not provided for certain undistributed foreign earnings intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. 2012. The GAAP effective tax rate of 29.5% for 2012 included a $21 million benefit related to the resolution of certain outstanding tax positions and a $50 million net non-cash benefit related to
the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities including tax legislation enacted in the United Kingdom and the state and local income tax effect resulting from changes in the Company’s organizational structure. The as adjusted effective tax rate of 31.0% for 2012 excluded the $50 million net non-cash tax benefit mentioned above. 2011. The GAAP effective tax rate of 25.4% for 2011 included a $24 million benefit related to the resolution of certain outstanding tax
positions and $198 million of net non-cash tax benefits due to a state tax election and enacted U.K., Japan, U.S. state and local tax legislation. The
2011 as adjusted effective tax rate of 31.7% included the $24 million benefit related to the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities and excluded the $198 million net non-cash benefit. 2010. The GAAP effective tax rate of 32.0% for 2010 included a $30 million non-cash tax benefit related to the revaluation of certain net deferred
income tax liabilities primarily related to acquired intangible assets due to enacted U.K. tax legislation. In addition, 2010 included the effect of favorable tax rulings and the resolution of certain outstanding tax positions. The as adjusted effective tax rate of 33.0% for 2010 excluded the $30 million non-cash tax benefit mentioned above. Balance Sheet Overview As Adjusted Balance Sheet The following table presents a reconciliation of the Company’s consolidated
statement of financial condition presented on a GAAP basis to the Company’s consolidated statement of financial condition excluding the impact of separate account assets and collateral held under securities lending agreements (directly related
to lending securities held by separate account assets) and separate account liabilities and collateral liabilities under securities lending agreements, consolidated variable interest entities (“VIEs”) and consolidated sponsored investment
funds. The Company presents the as adjusted balance sheet as additional information to enable investors to eliminate gross presentation of certain
assets that have equal and offsetting liabilities or non-controlling interests and ultimately do not have an impact on stockholders’ equity (excluding appropriated retained earnings related to consolidated collateralized loan obligations) or
cash flows. Management reviews the Company’s as adjusted balance sheet, a non-GAAP financial measure, as an economic presentation of its total assets and liabilities; however, it does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial
measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Separate Account Assets and Liabilities
and Collateral Held under Securities Lending Agreements The separate account assets are maintained by a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company,
which is a registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom, and represent segregated assets held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. In accordance with GAAP, the Company records equal and offsetting separate
account liabilities. The separate account assets are not available to creditors of the Company and the holders of the pension contracts have no recourse to the Company’s assets. The net investment income attributable to separate account assets
accrues directly to the contract owners and is not reported on the Company’s consolidated statements of income. While 53 Table of Contents BlackRock has no economic interest in these assets or liabilities, BlackRock earns an investment advisory fee for the service of managing these assets on behalf of the clients. In addition, the Company records on its consolidated statements of financial condition the collateral received under securities lending arrangements as its own
asset in addition to an equal and offsetting collateral liability for the obligation to return the collateral. Consolidated VIEs At December 31, 2012, BlackRock’s consolidated VIEs included CLOs and one investment fund. The assets of these VIEs are not available to creditors of the Company and the Company has no obligation to
settle the liabilities of the VIEs. While BlackRock has no material economic interest in these assets or liabilities, BlackRock earns an investment advisory fee, as well as a potential performance fee, for the service of managing these assets on
behalf of clients. December 31, 2012 Segregated client assets generating advisory fees in which BlackRock has no economic interest

financial condition at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011: December 31, 2012 December 31, 2011 Variance (Dollar amounts in millions) Amount % Change Assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 4,606 $ 3,506 $ 1,100 31 % Accounts receivable 2,250 1,960 290 15 % Investments 1,750 1,631 119 7 % Goodwill and intangible assets, net 30,312 30,148 164 1 % Other assets (1) 1,183 1,169 14 1 % Liabilities: Accrued compensation and benefits 1,547 1,383 164 12 % Accounts payable and accrued liabilities 1,055 923 132 14 % Borrowings (2) 5,787 4,790 997 21 % Deferred income tax liabilities 5,293 5,323 (30 ) (1 %) Other liabilities (3) 858 743 115 15 % Stockholders’ equity 25,403 25,048 355 1 % (1) Amounts include due from related parties, deferred sales commissions, property and equipment and other assets. (2) Amounts include short-term and long-term borrowings. (3) Amounts include due to related parties and other liabilities. The following discussion summarizes the significant changes in assets and liabilities. The discussion does not
include changes related to assets and liabilities that are equal and offsetting and have no impact on BlackRock’s stockholders’ equity. Cash and Cash Equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011 included $133 million and $196 million of cash
held by consolidated sponsored investment funds, respectively. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for details on the change in cash and cash equivalents during 2012. Accounts Receivable. Accounts receivable at December 31, 2012 increased $290 million from December 31, 2011, primarily reflecting higher receivables resulting from an increase in base fees related
to AUM growth and higher performance fees, and an increase in unit trust receivables, substantially offset by an increase in unit trust payables recorded within accounts payable and accrued liabilities. Investments. BlackRock reports its investments on a GAAP basis, which includes investments that are held by
sponsored investment funds deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP. As a result, management reviews BlackRock’s investments on an “economic” basis, which eliminates the portion of investments that do not impact
BlackRock’s book value. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company presents total investments, as adjusted, to enable investors to understand the portion of its investments that are owned by the Company, net of NCI, as
a gauge to measure the impact of changes in net non-operating gain (loss) on investments to net income (loss) attributable to BlackRock. 55 Table of Contents The Company further presents total net “economic” investment exposure, net of deferred compensation
investments and hedged investments, to reflect another gauge for investors as the economic impact of investments held pursuant to deferred compensation arrangements is substantially offset by a change in compensation expense and the impact of hedged
investments is substantially mitigated by total return swap hedges. Carried interest capital allocations are excluded as there is no impact to BlackRock’s stockholders’ equity until such amounts are realized as performance fees. Finally,
the Company’s regulatory investment in Federal Reserve Bank stock, which is not subject to market or interest rate risk, is excluded from the Company’s net economic investment exposure. (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31, 2012 December 31, 2011 Total investments, GAAP $ 1,750 $ 1,631 Investments held by consolidated sponsored investment

maintained in sponsored investment funds that were deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP, and, therefore, are consolidated even though BlackRock may not economically own a majority of such funds. (2) The decrease of $239 million related to a lower holding requirement of Federal Reserve Bank stock held by BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A.
(“BTC”). Total investments, as adjusted, at December 31, 2012 increased $137 million from December 31, 2011,
resulting from $765 million of purchases/capital contributions, $185 million from positive market valuations and earnings from equity method investments, and $64 million from net additional carried interest capital allocations, partially
offset by $742 million of sales/maturities and $135 million of distributions representing return of capital and return on investments. 56 Table of Contents The following table represents the carrying value of investments, by asset type, at December 31, 2012 and
December 31, 2011: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31, 2012 December 31, 2011 Variance Amount % Change Private equity $ 298 $ 306 $ (8 ) (3 %) Real estate 122 108 14 13 % Distressed credit/mortgage funds 214 217 (3 ) (1 %) Hedge funds/funds of hedge funds 159 167 (8 ) (5 %) Other investments (1) 418 264 154 58 % Total “economic” investment exposure $ 1,211 $ 1,062 $ 149 14 % (1) Other investments primarily include seed investments in fixed income, commodities and equity funds/strategies as well as U.K. government securities held for
regulatory purposes. The increase in other investments reflected higher seed investments in fourth quarter 2012. The following table
represents investments, as adjusted at December 31, 2012: (Dollar amounts in millions) Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Other Investments Not Held at Fair Value (1) Investments at December 31, 2012 Total investments, as adjusted (2) $ 541 $ 196 $ 548 $ 371 $ 1,656 (1) Amount includes investments held at cost, amortized cost, carried interest and equity method investments, which include investment companies, which in accordance
with GAAP are not accounted for under a fair value measure. In accordance with GAAP, certain equity method investees do not account for both their financial assets and financial liabilities under fair value measures, therefore, the Company’s
investment in such equity method investees may not represent fair value. (2) Amounts include BlackRock’s portion of cash and cash equivalents, other assets and liabilities that are consolidated from non-VIE sponsored investment
funds. See Note 5, Fair Value Disclosures, to the Company’s consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this filing, for total GAAP investments. Goodwill and Intangible Assets. Goodwill and intangible assets at December 31, 2012 increased $164
million from December 31, 2011, primarily due to the SRPEP and Claymore Transactions, partially offset by $157 million of amortization expense. Other Assets. Other assets at December 31, 2012 increased $14 million from December 31, 2011, primarily related to higher earnings from certain
operating advisory company investments and an increase in property and equipment, partially offset by a decline in receivables from related parties and lower current income taxes receivable. Accrued Compensation and Benefits. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2012 increased $164 million from December 31, 2011, primarily related to higher 2012 incentive compensation
accruals. Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities at December 31, 2012 increased $132 million
from December 31, 2011, due to higher unit trust payables (substantially offset by an increase in unit trust receivables recorded within accounts receivable), increased accruals, including direct fund expenses and marketing and higher current income taxes payable. Borrowings. Borrowings at December 31, 2012 increased $997 million from December 31, 2011 primarily resulting from $1.5 billion of net proceeds from new issuances of long-term borrowings, partially offset by repayments of $500 million. Deferred Income Tax Liabilities. Net deferred income tax liabilities at December 31, 2012 decreased $30 million, primarily as a result of the effects
of temporary differences associated with deferred stock compensation and investment income offset by the Claymore Transaction. In addition, the decrease related to the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities due to tax legislation
enacted in the United Kingdom and the state and local income tax effect resulting from changes in the Company’s organizational structure. Other
Liabilities. Other liabilities at December 31, 2012 increased $115 million from December 31, 2011, primarily resulting from an increase in deferred carried interest, liabilities of consolidated funds and other operating liabilities. 57 Table of Contents Stockholders’ Equity. Total stockholders’ equity at December 31, 2012 increased $355 million
from December 31, 2011, resulting from $2.5 billion of net income attributable to BlackRock, $451 million of stock-based compensation expense, $64 million excess tax benefits from vested stock-based compensation, $53 million of foreign currency
translation adjustments and $56 million of issuances of common shares related to employee stock transactions. The increase in stockholders’ equity was partially offset by $1.7 billion of share repurchases and $1.1 billion of cash dividend
payments. Liquidity and Capital Resources BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds and VIEs In accordance with GAAP, BlackRock consolidates certain BlackRock sponsored investment funds and CLOs, notwithstanding the fact BlackRock may only have a minority interest, if any, in these funds or CLOs. As a result, BlackRock’s consolidated statements of cash flows include the cash flows of
consolidated sponsored investment funds and CLOs. The Company uses an adjusted cash flow statement, which excludes the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds and CLOs, as a supplemental non-GAAP measure to assess liquidity and capital
requirements. The Company believes that its cash flows, excluding the impact of the consolidated sponsored investment funds and CLOs, provide investors with useful information on the cash flows of BlackRock relating to its ability to fund additional
operating, investing and financing activities. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, its cash flows presented in accordance with GAAP. The following table presents a reconciliation
of the consolidated statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis to the consolidated statements of cash flows, excluding the impact of the cash flows of consolidated sponsored investment funds and consolidated VIEs: (Dollar amounts in millions) GAAP Basis Impact on Cash Flows of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds Impact on Cash Flows of Consolidated VIEs Cash Flows Excluding Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds and

lending revenue, performance fees, revenue from BlackRock Solutions and advisory products and services, other revenue and distribution fees. BlackRock uses its cash to pay compensation and benefits, distribution and servicing costs, direct fund expenses,
general and administration expenses, interest and principal on the Company’s borrowings, income taxes, dividends on BlackRock’s capital stock, repurchases of the Company’s stock, capital expenditures and purchases of co-investments
and seed investments. 58 Table of Contents Cash flows from operating activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds and VIEs,
primarily include the receipt of investment advisory and administration fees, securities lending revenue and other revenue offset by the payment of operating expenses incurred in the normal course of business, including the effect of cash payments
related to year-end incentive compensation. Cash outflows from investing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds
and VIEs, for the year ended December 31, 2012 were $55 million and primarily included $435 million of purchases of investments, $267 million related to the Claymore and SRPEP Transactions and $150 million of purchases of property and
equipment, partially offset by $724 million of net proceeds from sales and maturities of investments and $73 million of return of capital from equity method investees. Cash outflows from financing
activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds and VIEs, for the year ended December 31, 2012 were $1.6 billion, including $1.7 billion of share repurchases, including $1.0 billion from Barclays, $500 million in
open market transactions, and $0.2 billion of employee tax withholdings related to employee stock transactions, $1.1 billion of payments for cash dividends and a $0.5 billion repayment of long-term debt. Cash outflows from financing activities were
partially offset by cash inflows related to $1.5 billion of net proceeds from long-term borrowings, $74 million of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation and $47 million of proceeds from stock options exercised. Capital Resources The Company manages its financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. Capital resources at December 31,
2012 and 2011 were as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31, 2012 December 31, 2011 Variance Amount % Change Cash and cash equivalents $ 4,606 $ 3,506 $ 1,100 31 % Cash and cash equivalents held by consolidated sponsored investment

Total liquidity increased $1.4 billion during 2012, primarily reflecting positive operating cash flows, proceeds from
long-term debt issuances in May 2012 and the increased aggregate commitment of the 2012 credit facility from $3.5 billion to $3.785 billion, partially offset by share repurchases, including $1.0 billion from Barclays and $500 million in open market
transactions, and the long-term debt repayments of $500 million. A portion of liquidity may be utilized to pay down the current portion of long-term debt maturing in 2013. Share Repurchase Approvals. In January 2013, the Board of Directors (the “Board”) approved an increase in the availability under the Company’s existing share repurchase program to allow for
the repurchase of up to 10.2 million shares of BlackRock common stock. In February 2012, the Board approved an increase in the availability under
the Company’s then existing share repurchase program to allow for the repurchase of up to 5.0 million shares. The Company repurchased 2,726,600 shares in open market transactions for approximately $500 million during 2012.
As of December 31, 2012, there were 2,725,400 shares still authorized to be repurchased, which are included in the total January 2013 Board authorization of 10.2 million shares. Net Capital Requirements. The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain regulated subsidiaries within a number of jurisdictions, which is partially maintained by retaining cash and cash
equivalents in those jurisdictions. As a result, such subsidiaries of the Company may be restricted in their ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions and to their parents. Additionally, transfers of cash between international
jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. 59 Table of Contents BTC is chartered as a national bank that does not accept client deposits and whose powers are limited to trust
activities. BTC provides investment management services, including investment advisory and securities lending agency services to institutional investors and other clients. BTC is subject to various regulatory capital and liquid asset requirements
administered by Federal banking agencies. At December 31, 2012, the Company was required to maintain approximately $1,209 million, compared with
$1,196 million at December 31, 2011, in net capital in certain regulated subsidiaries, including BTC, entities regulated by the Financial Services Authority in the United Kingdom and the Company’s broker-dealers, and was in compliance with all applicable regulatory minimum net capital requirements. Undistributed Earnings of Foreign Subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2012, the Company has not provided for U.S. federal and state income
taxes on approximately $2,125 million of undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries. Such earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. The Company’s current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate
these funds. Contractual Obligations, Commitments and
Contingencies The following table sets forth contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies by year of payment at December 31, 2012: (Dollar amounts in millions) 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 Thereafter Total Contractual obligations and commitments: Short-term borrowings: Principal $ 100 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 100 Long-term borrowings (1) : Principal 750 1,000 750 — 700 2,500 5,700 Interest (2) 200 196 156 151 151 342 1,196 Operating leases 134 122 113 104 105 784 1,362 Purchase obligations 78 70 34 23 8 — 213 Investment commitments 235 — — — — — 235 Total contractual obligations and commitments 1,497 1,388 1,053 278 964 3,626 8,806 Contingent obligations: Contingent distribution obligations 179 — — — — — 179 Total contractual obligations, commitments and contingent
obligations (3) $ 1,676 $ 1,388 $ 1,053 $ 278 $ 964 $ 3,626 $ 8,985 (1) Long-term borrowings exclude the borrowings of consolidated CLOs. The Company has no obligation to settle the liabilities of these CLOs. (2) Interest payable on the 2013 floating rate notes was calculated using a fixed rate of 1.03% as a result of the interest rate swap entered into in conjunction
with the obligation. (3) As of December 31, 2012, the Company had $313 million of net unrecognized tax benefits. Due to the uncertainty of timing and amounts that will ultimately be
paid, this amount has been excluded from the table above. Short-term Borrowings. The following describes the Company’s short-term borrowing arrangements that the Company has access to utilize. 2012 Revolving Credit Facility . In March 2012, the 2011 credit facility was amended to extend the maturity date by one year to March 2017 and in
April 2012 the amount of the aggregate commitment was increased to $3.785 billion (the “2012 credit facility”). The 2012 credit facility permits the Company to request an additional $1.0 billion of borrowing capacity, subject to lender
credit approval, increasing the overall size of the 2012 credit facility to an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $4.785 billion. Interest on borrowings outstanding accrues at a rate based on the applicable London Interbank Offered Rate plus a spread. The 2012 credit
facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, where net debt equals total debt less unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied with a
ratio of less than 1 to 1 at December 31, 2012. The 2012 credit facility provides back-up liquidity, funds ongoing working capital for general
corporate purposes and funds various investment opportunities. At December 31, 2012, the Company had $100 million 60 Table of Contents outstanding under this facility with an interest rate of 1.085% and a maturity during January 2013. During January 2013, the Company rolled over the $100 million in borrowings at an interest rate
of 1.085% and a maturity during February 2013. During February 2013, the Company rolled over the $100 million in borrowings at an interest rate of 1.075% and a maturity during March 2013. Commercial Paper Program. On October 14, 2009, BlackRock established a commercial paper program (the “CP Program”) under which the Company could issue unsecured commercial paper notes (the
“CP Notes”) on a private placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $3.0 billion. On May 13, 2011, BlackRock increased the maximum aggregate amount that may be borrowed under the CP Program to $3.5
billion. On May 17, 2012, BlackRock increased the maximum aggregate amount to $3.785 billion. The CP Program is currently supported by the 2012 credit facility. As of December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, BlackRock had no CP Notes
outstanding. Long-term Borrowings. At December 31, 2012, the principal amount of long-term borrowings, including current portion, was $5.7
billion. 2017 Notes . In September 2007, the Company issued $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured and
unsubordinated notes maturing on September 15, 2017 (the “2017 Notes”). A portion of the net proceeds of the 2017 Notes was used to fund the initial cash payment for the acquisition of the fund of funds business of Quellos and the
remainder was used for general corporate purposes. Interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year, or approximately $44 million per year. The 2017 Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time
in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a “make-whole” redemption price. 2012, 2014 and 2019 Notes . In December
2009, the Company issued $2.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of unsecured and unsubordinated obligations. These notes were issued as three separate series of senior debt securities including $0.5 billion of 2.25% notes, which were repaid in
December 2012, and $1.0 billion of 3.50% notes and $1.0 billion of 5.0% notes maturing in December 2014 and 2019, respectively. Net proceeds of this offering were used to repay borrowings under the CP program, which was used to finance a portion of
the BGI Transaction, and for general corporate purposes. These notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a “make-whole” redemption price. Interest on the 2014 Notes and 2019
Notes of approximately $35 million and $50 million per year, respectively, is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 10 and December 10 of each year. In 2012, approximately $96 million of interest was paid related to the 2012, 2014 and 2019 Notes. 2013 and 2021 Notes. In May 2011, the Company issued $1.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of unsecured unsubordinated obligations. These notes
were issued as two separate series of senior debt securities including $750 million of 4.25% notes and $750 million of floating rate notes maturing in May 2021 and 2013, respectively. Net proceeds of this offering were used to fund the repurchase of
BlackRock’s Series B Preferred from affiliates of Merrill Lynch. Interest on the 4.25% notes due in 2021 (“2021 Notes”) is payable semi-annually on May 24 and November 24 of each year, which commenced November 24, 2011,
and is approximately $32 million per year. Interest on the floating rate notes due in 2013 (“2013 Floating Rate Notes”) is payable quarterly on February 24, May 24, August 24 and November 24 of each year. The
2021 Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a “make-whole” redemption price. The 2013 Floating Rate Notes may not be redeemed at the Company’s option before maturity. In May 2011, in conjunction with the issuance of the 2013 Floating Rate Notes, the Company entered into a $750 million notional interest rate swap
maturing in 2013 to hedge the future cash flows of its obligation at a fixed rate of 1.03% payable semi-annually on May 24 and November 24 of each year, which commenced November 24, 2011. The interest rate swap effectively converts
the 2013 Floating Rate Notes to a fixed rate obligation. 2015 and 2022 Notes. In May 2012, the Company issued $1.5 billion in aggregate
principal amount of unsecured unsubordinated obligations. These notes were issued as two separate series of senior debt securities, including $750 million of 1.375% notes maturing in June 2015 (the “2015 Notes”) and $750 million of 3.375%
notes maturing in June 2022 (the “2022 Notes”). Net proceeds were used to fund the repurchase of BlackRock’s common stock and Series B Preferred from Barclays and affiliates and for general corporate purposes. Interest on the 2015
Notes and 2022 Notes of approximately $10 million and $25 million per year, respectively, is payable semi-annually on June 1 and December 1 of each year, which commenced December 1, 2012. The 2015 Notes and 2022 Notes may be redeemed
prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a “make-whole” redemption price. The “make-whole” redemption price represents a price, subject to the specific terms of the 2015 and 2022 Notes and
related indenture, that is the greater of (a) par value and (b) the present value of future 61 Table of Contents payments that will not be paid because of an early redemption, which is discounted at a fixed spread over a comparable Treasury security. Operating Leases. The Company leases its primary office locations under agreements that expire on varying dates through 2035. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for
escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease-related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases
and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Purchase Obligations. In the ordinary
course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above
represent executory contracts, which are either non-cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2012, the Company’s obligations primarily reflected standard service contracts for portfolio, market data, office-related services
and third-party marketing and promotional services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Company’s financial statements when services are provided and, as such, obligations for services not received are not included in the consolidated
statement of financial condition at December 31, 2012. Investment Commitments. At December 31, 2012, the Company had $235 million of
various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment funds, including funds of private equity funds, real estate funds and distressed credit funds. This amount excludes additional commitments made by consolidated funds of funds to underlying
third-party funds as third-party non-controlling interest holders have the legal obligation to fund the respective commitments of such funds of funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown and the commitments are
callable on demand at any time prior to the expiration of the commitment. These unfunded commitments are not recorded on the consolidated statements of financial condition. These commitments do not include potential future commitments approved by
the Company, but which are not yet legally binding. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to fund additional investment products for, and with, its clients. Carried Interest Claw-back. As a general partner in certain investment funds, including private equity partnerships and certain hedge funds, the Company may
receive carried interest cash distributions from the partnerships in accordance with distribution provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in
the event the limited partners do not achieve a return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Therefore, BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw-back provisions in investments, or cash to the extent that it is
distributed, as a deferred carried interest liability on its consolidated statements of financial condition. Carried interest is realized and recorded as performance fees on its consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination
of the investment fund or when the likelihood of claw-back is mathematically improbable. Indemnifications. In many of the Company’s
contracts, including the BGI, MLIM and Quellos Transaction agreements, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability,
if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2012. See further discussion in Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies, to the
consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Form 10-K. On behalf of certain clients the Company lends securities to highly rated
banks and broker-dealers. In these securities lending transactions, the borrower is required to provide and maintain collateral at or above regulatory minimums. Securities on loan are marked to market daily to determine if the borrower is required
to pledge additional collateral. BlackRock has issued certain indemnifications to certain securities lending clients against potential losses resulting from a borrower’s failure to fulfill its obligations should the value of the collateral
pledged by the borrower at the time of default be insufficient to cover the borrower’s obligations under the securities lending agreement. The amount of securities on loan as of December 31, 2012 and subject to indemnification was $99.5
billion. The Company held, as agent, cash and securities totaling $104.8 billion as collateral for indemnified securities on loan at December 31, 2012. As part of the Barclays Global Investors (“BGI”) acquisition, Barclays was
contractually obligated to continue providing counterparty default indemnification to certain BlackRock securities lending clients through December 1, 2012. BlackRock assumed these indemnification obligations prior to or upon the expiration of
Barclays’ indemnification obligation. The amount of client balances indemnified increased in the fourth quarter 2012 due to the Company’s assumption of Barclays’ indemnification obligations on December 1, 2012. The fair value of
these indemnifications was not 62 Table of Contents material at December 31, 2012. The Company currently expects indemnified balances to continue to increase over time. While the collateral pledged by a borrower is intended to be sufficient to offset the borrower’s obligations to return securities borrowed and any other amounts owing to the lender under the relevant
securities lending agreement, in the event of a borrower default, the Company can give no assurance that the collateral pledged by the borrower will be sufficient to fulfill such obligations. If the amount of such pledged collateral is not
sufficient to fulfill such obligations to a client for whom the Company has provided indemnification, BlackRock would be responsible for the amount of the shortfall. These indemnifications cover only the collateral shortfall described above, and do
not in any way, guarantee, assume or otherwise insure the investment performance or return of any cash collateral vehicle into which securities lending cash collateral is invested. Contingent Distribution Obligations. In November 2010, BlackRock entered into a second amended and restated global distribution agreement with Merrill Lynch, which requires the Company to make payments to
Merrill Lynch contingent upon sales of products and level of AUM maintained in certain BlackRock products. The economic terms of the agreement will remain in effect until January 2014. After such term, the agreement will renew for one automatic
three-year extension if certain conditions are satisfied. The obligation for 2014, 2015 and 2016 is not included in the table above as the amounts are not currently determinable. The following items have not been included in the contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies table: Compensation and Benefit Obligations. The Company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments
payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the table contractual obligations and commitments above. These arrangements are discussed in more detail in Notes
13, Stock-Based Compensation, and 14, Employee Benefit Plans, to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Form 10-K. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2012 totaled $1,547 million and included incentive
compensation of $1,168 million, deferred compensation of $137 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $242 million. Substantially all of the incentive compensation liability was paid in the first quarter of 2013, while the
deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years. Separate Account Liabilities. At December 31, 2012, the Company had $134.8 billion of separate account
assets and offsetting liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual
obligations table above. Short-Term Investment Funds. Barclays has provided capital support agreements to support certain cash management funds
acquired by BlackRock in the BGI Transaction. Pursuant to the terms of the capital support agreements, Barclays agreed to cover losses on covered securities within the products in the aggregate of up to $2.2 billion from December 1, 2009
through December 1, 2013 or until certain criteria were met. BlackRock and Barclays have procedures in place to determine loss events on covered securities within the products and to ensure support payments from Barclays. On
October 9, 2012, BlackRock, on behalf of two of these funds, negotiated amendments to these capital support agreements to release Barclays from coverage provided for defaults on 51 covered securities (with an estimated value of approximately
$750 million) held in the funds in exchange for a payment by Barclays to the funds of $70 million. The payment was in an amount in excess of the payments that were expected under the Barclays capital support agreements. The Barclays capital
support agreements continued in effect for the remaining covered securities in these two funds, and after this transaction, at October 10, 2012, Barclays’ remaining potential obligation in the aggregate under the capital support agreements
was $1.6 billion. The support agreements for these two funds had a termination date of December 1, 2013 subject to an early termination option in the event that the applicable fund’s market value remained above a certain net asset value
per unit for 120 consecutive days. Barclays exercised its termination option for these two funds on December 7, 2012 and January 3, 2013. After these terminations, at January 31, 2013, Barclays’ remaining maximum potential
obligation in the aggregate under the capital support agreements was not material. As previously mentioned, the fourth quarter 2012 results included a
one-time $30 million charge related to a contribution to certain of these STIFs. This contribution resulted from actions taken to ensure compliance with new regulations from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) taking
effect in July 2013 that further limit a STIF’s weighted-average portfolio life maturity. BlackRock chose to sell certain securities held within STIFs and to make a one-time contribution to the STIFs to maintain the value of the funds
while ensuring compliance with the new OCC rules. The securities sold were held in funds managed by BGI prior to BlackRock’s 63 Table of Contents acquisition of BGI. Until adoption of the new STIF regulations, BlackRock had been pursuing a strategy to hold these securities as market values improved over time. As a result of the
fourth quarter security sales, these STIFs are currently in compliance with the new OCC rules. At December 31, 2012, BlackRock concluded that
although these funds were VIEs, it was not the primary beneficiary (“PB”) of these funds. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ
significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding the consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2, Significant
Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Form 10-K. Consolidation of Sponsored Investment Funds
and Securitization Products . Consolidation of sponsored investment funds and securitization products (collectively “investment products”) is determined pursuant to ASC 810, Consolidation . The accounting method used by the
Company depends upon the influence the Company has over its investee, the investment product. To the extent that BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investment product, which generally exists if there is a
50% or greater voting interest or if partners or members of certain products do not have substantive rights, BlackRock consolidates the investment product. For investment products in which BlackRock’s voting interest is less than 50%, an analysis is performed to determine if the investment product is a VIE or a voting rights entity. Upon the determination that
the investment product is a VIE, further analysis, as discussed below, is performed to determine if BlackRock is the PB of the investment product, which would require consolidation. Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities . Certain investment products for which the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests may be deemed VIEs. BlackRock reviews factors, including the rights of the equity holders and obligations of equity holders to absorb losses
or receive expected residual returns, to determine if the investment product is a VIE. BlackRock is required to consolidate a VIE when it is deemed to be the PB, which is evaluated continuously as facts and circumstances change. Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2010-10, Amendments to Statement 167 for Certain Investment Funds (“ASU 2010-10”) defers the
application of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 167, Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R), for certain investment funds, including money market funds. The PB of a VIE that meets the
conditions of ASU 2010-10 is the enterprise that has a variable interest (or combination of variable interests, including those of related parties) that absorbs the majority of the entity’s expected losses, receives a majority of the
entity’s expected residual returns, or both. Effective January 1, 2010, the PB of a VIE that does not meet the conditions for deferral in ASU 2010-10 is the enterprise that has the power to direct activities of the entity that most
significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that potentially could be significant to the VIE. Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the PB of a VIE. If the Company is determined to be the PB of a VIE, BlackRock will consolidate the entity. In order to determine
whether the Company is the PB of a VIE for entities that meet the conditions of ASU 2010-10, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of projected future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios.
Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or
marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. In the normal course of business, the Company is the
manager of various types of sponsored investment vehicles, including collateralized debt obligations (“CDOs”) or CLOs that do not meet the conditions of ASU 2010-10 and sponsored investment funds, which may be considered VIEs. 64 Table of Contents At December 31, 2012, the following balances related to consolidated VIEs including CLOs and an investment fund
on the consolidated statements of financial condition: (Dollar amounts in millions) CLOs Sponsored Private Equity Fund Total Consolidated VIEs Assets of consolidated VIEs: Cash and cash equivalents $ 294 $ 3 $ 297 Bank loans, bonds and other investments 2,240 24 2,264 Liabilities of consolidated VIEs: Borrowings (2,402 ) — (2,402 ) Other liabilities (103 ) — (103 ) Appropriated retained earnings (29 ) — (29 ) Non-controlling interests of consolidated VIEs — (27 ) (27 ) Total BlackRock net interests in consolidated VIEs $ — $ — $ — At December 31, 2012, BlackRock was the manager of over 20 CLOs/CDOs and other securitization entities. In
accordance with consolidation accounting guidance for VIEs, BlackRock was determined to be the PB for certain of these CLOs, which required BlackRock to consolidate these VIEs. BlackRock was deemed to be the PB because it has the power to direct the
activities of the CLO that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and has the right to receive benefits that potentially could be significant to the VIE. At December 31, 2012, the Company had $2,534 million and
$2,505 million in assets and liabilities, respectively, on its consolidated statement of financial condition related to these consolidated CLOs. In addition, the Company recorded appropriated retained earnings for the difference between the assets
and liabilities, as the CLO noteholders, not BlackRock, ultimately will receive the benefits or absorb the losses associated with the CLO’s assets and liabilities. The changes in the fair value of the assets and liabilities of these CLOs have
no impact on net income attributable to BlackRock or its cash flows. Excluding outstanding management fee receivables, the Company has no risk of loss with its involvement with these VIEs. At December 31, 2012, BlackRock was determined to be the PB of one sponsored private equity investment fund of funds in which it had a non-substantive investment and was deemed to absorb the majority of the
variability due to its de-facto third-party relationships with other partners in the fund, which limits the ability of the partners to transfer or sell their interests without BlackRock’s consent as the general partner of the fund. At
December 31, 2012, the Company had recorded $3 million, $24 million and $27 million in cash and cash equivalents, private equity investments and nonredeemable non-controlling interests of consolidated VIEs, respectively, on the consolidated statement
of financial condition related to this VIE. The changes in the fair value of the assets and liabilities of this VIE have no impact on net income attributable to BlackRock. Excluding outstanding management fee receivables, the Company has no risk of
loss with its involvement with this VIE. Consolidation of Voting Rights Entities . To the extent that BlackRock can exert control over the
financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if there is a 50% or greater voting interest or if partners or members of certain products do not have substantive rights, BlackRock consolidates the investee. The Company, as general partner or managing member of certain sponsored investment funds, generally is presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or
limited liability companies. Pursuant to ASC 810-20, Control of Partnerships and Similar Entities (“ASC 810-20”), the Company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining whether
other non-affiliated partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the investment vehicle, or otherwise to remove BlackRock as the general partner or managing member
without cause based on a simple unaffiliated majority vote, or have other substantive participating rights. If the investment vehicle is not a VIE and the presumption of control is not overcome, BlackRock will consolidate the investment vehicle. 65 Table of Contents At December 31, 2012 and 2011, as a result of consolidation of various investment products deemed to be voting
rights entities, including products where BlackRock owns 50% of greater of the voting rights of the product, under the consolidation policies described above, the Company had the following balances on its consolidated statements of financial
condition: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31, 2012 December 31, 2011 Cash and cash equivalents $ 133 $ 196 Investments: Trading investments 123 214 Other investments 401 373 Other assets 25 5 Other liabilities (65 ) (37 ) Non-controlling interests (187 ) (276 ) BlackRock’s net interests in consolidated investment funds $ 430 $ 475 The Company retained the specialized accounting of these investment funds pursuant to ASC 810-10. VIEs, including a consolidated
sponsored investment fund and CLOs, were excluded from the balances above as these balances are reported separately on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Investments Equity Method Investments . For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the
investee, and where it is not the PB of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company follows the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether the Company exerts control
or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the
type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement, including investor voting or other rights, the terms of BlackRock’s advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any
influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the fund’s operating documents and the relationship between BlackRock and other investors in the entity. Substantially all of BlackRock’s equity method investees are investment companies that record their underlying investments at fair value.
Therefore, under the equity method of accounting, BlackRock’s share of the investee’s underlying net income predominantly represents fair value adjustments in the investments held by the equity method investees. BlackRock’s share of the investee’s underlying net income or loss is based upon the most currently available
information and is recorded as non-operating income (expense) for investments in investment companies, or as other revenue for operating advisory company investments, which are recorded in other assets, since such investees are considered to be an
extension of BlackRock’s core business. At December 31, 2012, the Company had $604 million and $124 million of equity method investments,
including equity method investments held for deferred compensation, reflected within investments and other assets, respectively, and at December 31, 2011, the Company had $476 million and $80 million of equity method investees reflected in
investments and other assets, respectively. Impairment of Investment s. The Company’s management periodically assesses its equity method,
available-for-sale, held-to-maturity and cost investments for impairment. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If
the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Company’s carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded in the consolidated statement of income. When the fair value of available-for-sale securities is lower than cost, the Company evaluates the security to determine whether the impairment is considered to be “other-than-temporary”. In making this determination for equity securities, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the
extent to which the security’s market value is less than cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the security’s issuer and the Company’s ability and intent to hold the security for a length of time sufficient to allow
for recovery of such unrealized losses. If the impairment is considered other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded in non-operating income (expense) on the consolidated statement of income. In making this determination for debt securities, the Company considers whether: (1) it has the intent to sell the security, (2) it is more likely than
not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery or (3) it expects to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. If the Company does not intend to sell a security and it is not more likely than not that it will be
required to sell the security, but the security has suffered a credit loss, the credit loss will be bifurcated from the total 66 Table of Contents impairment and recorded in earnings with the remaining portion recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. Evaluation of securities impairments involves significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results, and these differences could have a material impact on the consolidated
statements of income. Fair Value Measurements Hierarchy of Fair Value Inputs . The provisions of ASC 820-10 establish a hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used to measure
fair value and require companies to disclose the fair value of their financial instruments according to the fair value hierarchy (i.e., Level 1, 2 and 3 inputs, as defined). The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices
(unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities measured and
reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories: Level 1 Inputs: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the reporting date. • Level 1 assets may include listed mutual funds (including those accounted for under the equity method of accounting as these mutual funds are investment
companies that have publicly available net asset values (“NAVs”), which in accordance with GAAP, are calculated under fair value measures and the changes are equal to the earnings of such funds), ETFs, listed equities and certain
exchange-traded derivatives. Level 2 Inputs: Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities that are not active;
quotes from pricing services or brokers for which the Company can determine that orderly transactions took place at the quoted price or that the inputs used to arrive at the price were observable; and inputs other than quoted prices that are
observable, such as models or other valuation methodologies. As a practical expedient, the Company relies on the NAV (or its equivalent) of certain investments as their fair value. • Level 2 assets may include debt securities, bank loans, short-term floating rate notes and asset-backed securities, securities held within consolidated hedge
funds, certain equity method limited partnership interests in hedge funds valued based on NAV (or its equivalent) where the Company has the ability to redeem at the measurement date or within the near term without redemption
restrictions, restricted public securities valued at a discount, as well as over–the-counter derivatives, including interest and inflation rate swaps and foreign exchange currency contracts that have inputs to the valuations that generally can
be corroborated by observable market data. Level 3 Inputs: Unobservable inputs for the valuation of the asset or liability, which may include non-binding broker quotes. Level 3 assets include investments for
which there is little, if any, market activity. These inputs require significant management judgment or estimation. Certain investments that are valued using NAV (or its equivalent) and are subject to current redemption restrictions that will not be
lifted in the near term are included in Level 3. • Level 3 assets may include general and limited partnership interests in private equity funds, funds of private equity funds, real estate funds, hedge funds,
funds of hedge funds, direct private equity investments held within consolidated funds, bonds and bank loans. • Level 3 liabilities include borrowings of consolidated CLOs valued based upon non-binding single-broker quotes. • Level 3 inputs include BlackRock capital accounts for its partnership interests in various alternative investments, including distressed credit hedge funds, real
estate and private equity funds, which may be adjusted by using the returns of certain market indices. BlackRock’s $679 million of Level 3 investments or 39% of total GAAP investments at December 31, 2012 primarily included the above
mentioned co-investments. Significance of Inputs . The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular
input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument. Valuation
Techniques . The fair values of certain Level 3 assets and liabilities were determined using various methodologies as appropriate, including NAVs of underlying investments, third-party pricing vendors, broker quotes and market and income
approaches. Such quotes and modeled prices are evaluated for reasonableness through various procedures, including due diligence reviews of third-party pricing vendors, variance analyses, consideration of current market environment and other
analytical procedures. 67 Table of Contents As a practical expedient, the Company relies on NAV as the fair value for certain investments. The inputs to value
these investments may include BlackRock capital accounts for its partnership interests in various alternative investments, including distressed credit hedge funds, real estate and private equity funds, which may be adjusted by using the returns of
certain market indices. The various partnerships are investment companies, which record their underlying investments at fair value based on fair value policies established by management of the underlying fund. Fair value policies at the underlying
fund generally require the fund to utilize pricing/valuation information, including independent appraisals, from third-party sources. However, in some instances, current valuation information for illiquid securities or securities in markets that are
not active may not be available from any third-party source or fund management may conclude that the valuations that are available from third-party sources are not reliable. In these instances, fund management may perform model-based analytical
valuations that may be used as an input to value these investments. A significant amount of inputs used to value equity, debt securities and bank loans
is sourced from well-recognized third-party pricing vendors. Generally, prices obtained from pricing vendors are categorized as Level 1 inputs for identical securities traded in active markets and as Level 2 for other similar securities if the
vendor uses observable inputs in determining the price. Annually, BlackRock’s internal valuation committee or other designated groups review both the valuation methodology, including the general assumptions and methods used to value various
asset classes, and operational process with these vendors. In addition, on a quarterly basis, meetings are held with the vendors to identify any significant changes to the vendors’ processes. In addition, quotes obtained from brokers generally are non-binding and categorized as Level 3 inputs. However, if the Company is able to determine that market
participants have transacted for the asset in an orderly manner near the quoted price or if the Company can determine that the inputs used by the broker are observable, the quote is classified as a Level 2 input. Changes in Valuation . Changes in value on $1,275 million of investments will impact the Company’s non-operating income (expense), $158 million
will impact accumulated other comprehensive income, $232 million are held at cost or amortized cost and the remaining $85 million relates to carried interest which will not impact non-operating income (expense). As of December 31, 2012, changes
in fair value of approximately $524 million of such investments within consolidated sponsored investment funds will impact BlackRock’s net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests expense on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRock’s net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated sponsored investment funds was $430 million. Goodwill and Intangible Assets The value of advisory
contracts acquired in business acquisitions to manage AUM in proprietary open- and closed-end investment funds as well as collective trust funds without a specified termination date are classified as indefinite-lived intangible assets. The
assignment of indefinite lives to such investment fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. In
addition, trade names/trademarks are considered indefinite-lived intangibles as they are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. In
accordance with the applicable provisions of ASC 350, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other (“ASC 350”), indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite-lived management contracts, which relate to acquired
separate accounts and funds with a specified termination date, are amortized over their remaining expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2012, ranged from 1 to 12 years with a weighted-average remaining estimated useful life of 4.9
years. Goodwill . The Company assesses its goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as the book value and the market
capitalization of the Company. The impairment test performed as of July 31, 2012 indicated that no impairment charge was required. The Company continuously monitors its book value per share as compared with closing prices of its common stock
for potential indicators of impairment. At December 31, 2012, the Company’s common stock closed at $206.71, which exceeded its book value per share of approximately $148.20 after excluding appropriated retained earnings. Indefinite-lived and finite-lived intangibles . The Company performs assessments to determine if any intangible assets are potentially impaired and whether
the indefinite-life and finite-life classifications are still appropriate. In evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of indefinite-lived intangibles is less than its carrying value, BlackRock assesses various significant
factors including AUM, revenue basis points, projected AUM growth rates, operating margins, tax rates and discount rates. In addition, the Company considers other factors including: (i) macroeconomic conditions such as a deterioration in
general economic conditions, limitations on accessing capital, fluctuations in foreign 68 Table of Contents exchange rates, or other developments in equity and credit markets; (ii) industry and market considerations such as a deterioration in the environment in which an entity operates, an
increased competitive environment, a decline in market-dependent multiples or metrics, a change in the market for an entity’s services, or regulatory, legal or political developments; and (iii) entity-specific events, such as a change in
management or key personnel, overall financial performance and litigation that could affect significant inputs. If potential impairment circumstances
are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. Actual results could differ from these cash flow estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. If the asset is
determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value would be recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurs. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which finite-lived intangible assets will contribute to the Company’s cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed.
A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite-lived intangible asset to a finite-lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Company’s amortization expense, which was
$157 million, $156 million and $160 million for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. In 2012, 2011 and 2010, the Company performed impairment tests that
indicated no impairment charges were required, the classification of indefinite-lived versus finite-lived intangibles was still appropriate and no changes to the expected lives of the finite-lived intangibles were required. The Company continuously
monitors various factors, including AUM, for potential indicators of impairment. Income Taxes. The Company accounts for income taxes under the
asset and liability method prescribed by ASC 740, Income Taxes (“ASC 740”). Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets
and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Significant management judgment is required in estimating the
ranges of possible outcomes and determining the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes, that require significant management judgment. Actual future tax consequences relating to uncertain tax
positions may be materially different than the Company’s current estimates. At December 31, 2012, BlackRock had $404 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $250 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. In accordance with ASC 740, management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions
about the future deductibility of deferred income tax assets and assess deferred income tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred income tax assets and liabilities. At
December 31, 2012, the Company had deferred tax assets of $4 million and deferred tax liabilities of approximately $5,293 million on the consolidated statement of financial condition. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and
liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status
of the Company. ASC 740 requires the Company to assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred income tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than
not standard. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecast of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods, the Company’s experience with
tax attributes expiring unused, and tax planning alternatives. At December 31, 2012, the Company had recorded a deferred tax asset of $71 million
for unrealized investment losses; however, no valuation allowance has been established because the Company expects to hold certain equity method investments which invest in fixed income securities over a period sufficient for them to recover their
unrealized losses, and generate future capital gains sufficient to offset the unrealized capital losses. Based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized. However, changes in
circumstance could cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the consolidated statements of income in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Company’s consolidated
financial statements. See Note 19, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Form 10-K for further details. 69 Table of Contents The Company records income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company’s actual
tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivables of approximately $102 million and current income taxes payables of $121 million at December 31, 2012. Revenue Recognition. Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on
pre-determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate clients, net operating income generated by the underlying properties. Investment advisory and administration fees are affected by changes in AUM, including
market appreciation or depreciation, foreign exchange translation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for investment funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to contractual expense limitations of the
funds or voluntary waivers. The Company contracts with third parties and related parties for various fund distribution and shareholder servicing to be
performed on behalf of certain funds the Company manages. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that
the Company bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with ASC 605-45, Revenue Recognition – Principle Agent Considerations (“ASC 605-45”), and records its
management fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for 2012, 2011 and 2010 were $793 million, $928 million and $831 million, respectively. The Company has additional contracts for similar services with third parties, which due to the terms of the
contracts, are recorded as distribution and servicing costs and thus not netted on the consolidated statements of income. The Company earns revenue by
lending securities on behalf of clients, primarily to brokerage institutions. Such revenues are accounted for on an accrual basis. The securities loaned are secured by collateral, generally ranging from 102% to 112% of the value of the loaned
securities. The revenue earned is shared between the Company and the funds or other third-party accounts managed by the Company from which the securities are borrowed. For 2012, 2011 and 2010, securities lending revenue totaled $510 million, $397
million and $325 million, respectively, and is recorded in investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue on the consolidated statements of income. Investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue are
reported together as the fees for these services often are agreed upon with clients as a bundled fee. The Company receives investment advisory performance fees or incentive allocation from certain actively managed
investment funds and certain separately managed accounts. These performance fees are earned upon exceeding specified relative and/or absolute investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period, which
varies by product or account, and could be monthly, quarterly, annually or longer. For the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, performance fee revenue totaled $463 million, $371 million and $540 million, respectively. In addition, the
Company receives carried interest from certain alternative investments upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these funds. Therefore,
BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw-back provisions in investments or cash to the extent that it is distributed, on its consolidated statements of financial condition. Carried interest is realized and recorded as performance fee
revenue upon the earlier of the termination of the investment fund or when the likelihood of claw-back is mathematically improbable. The Company records realized carried interest as performance fees on its consolidated statements of income. The
Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations related to carried interest prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, the Company had $97
million and $33 million, respectively, of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. The ultimate recognition of performance fee revenue, if any, for these products is unknown. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions , which include advisory services, are recorded as services are performed and are determined using some, or
all, of the following methods: (i) percentages of various attributes of advisory AUM or value of positions on the Aladdin platform, (ii) fixed fees and (iii) performance fees if contractual thresholds are met. Revenue earned on
advisory assignments was comprised of one-time advisory and portfolio structuring fees and ongoing fees based on AUM of the respective portfolio assignment. For 2012, 2011 and 2010, BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue totaled $518
million, $510 million and $460 million, respectively. Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the
majority of BlackRock’s investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated based on the fair value of AUM and since the Company does not record performance revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of
claw-back is mathematically improbable. 70 Table of Contents Accounting Developments For accounting pronouncements the Company adopted during 2012 and for recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted, see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. Recent Developments BlackRock holds an approximately
one-third equity interest in Private National Mortgage Acceptance Company, LLC (“PennyMac”), accounted for as an equity method investment. PennyMac Financial Services, Inc., which is proposed to become a holding company of PennyMac,
recently filed a Form S-1 with the SEC to effectively take PennyMac public. A successful offering by PennyMac may require BlackRock to adjust its investment in PennyMac at the time of the offering. Given the uncertain nature of the registration and
offering process for PennyMac, the amount and timing of any such potential gains or changes in carrying values is uncertain.
