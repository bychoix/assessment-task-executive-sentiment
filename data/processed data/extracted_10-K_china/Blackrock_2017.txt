Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Non-GAAP Financial Measures”, for further information on non-GAAP financial measures and for as adjusted items for 2016, 2015, and 2014.  In 2013, the Company made a charitable contribution of approximately six million units of the Company’s investment in PennyMac Financial Services, Inc. (“PennyMac”) to a donor advised fund.  The expense related to the charitable contribution was excluded from operating income, as adjusted, due to its nonrecurring nature and because the noncash, nonoperating pre-tax gain directly related to the contributed PennyMac investment was reported in nonoperating income (expense).  In 2012, operating income, as adjusted, included an adjustment related to estimated lease exit costs initially recorded in 2011 and the contribution to certain of the Company’s bank-managed short-term investment funds.  In 2013 and 2012, the portion of compensation expense associated with certain long-term incentive plans (“LTIP”) funded, or to be funded, through share distributions to participants of BlackRock stock held by PNC has been excluded because it ultimately did not impact BlackRock’s book value. Compensation expense associated with appreciation (depreciation) on investments related to certain BlackRock deferred compensation plans has been excluded as returns on investments set aside for these plans, which substantially offset this expense, are reported in nonoperating income (expense). (3) Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, and diluted earnings per common share, as adjusted exclude the after-tax impact of the items listed above and also include the effect on deferred income tax expense resulting from certain income tax matters. (4) Percentage represents compounded annual growth rate (“CAGR”) over a five-year period (2011-2016).

(2) Percentage represents CAGR over a five-year period (2011-2016). AUM represents the broad range of financial assets we manage for clients on a discretionary basis pursuant to investment management agreements that are expected to continue for at least 12 months. In general, reported AUM reflects the valuation methodology that corresponds to the basis used for determining revenue (for example, net asset value). Reported AUM does not include assets for which we provide risk management or other forms of nondiscretionary advice, or assets that we are retained to manage on a short-term, temporary basis. Investment management fees are typically expressed as a percentage of AUM. We also earn performance fees on certain portfolios relative to an agreed-upon benchmark or return hurdle. On some products, we also may earn securities lending revenue. In addition, BlackRock offers its proprietary Aladdin investment system as well as risk management, outsourcing, advisory and technology services, to institutional investors and wealth management intermediaries under the BlackRock Solutions name. Revenue for these services may be based on several criteria including value of positions, number of users, accomplishment of specific deliverables or other objectives. At December 31, 2016, total AUM was $5.1 trillion, representing a CAGR of 8% over the last five years. AUM growth during the period was achieved through the combination of net market valuation gains, net inflows and acquisitions, including Claymore and SRPEP, which collectively added $13.7 billion of AUM in 2012, Credit Suisse and MGPA, which collectively added $26.9 billion of AUM in 2013, BKCA, Infraestructura Institucional and FutureAdvisor, which collectively added $2.2 billion of AUM in 2015 and BofA Global Capital Management which added $80.6 billion of AUM in 2016. Our AUM mix encompasses a broadly diversified product range, as described below. The Company considers the categorization of its AUM by client type, product type, investment style and client region useful to understanding its business. The following discussion of the Company’s AUM will be organized as follows: Client Type Product Type Investment Style Client Region ☐ Retail ☐ Equity ☐ Active ☐ Americas ☐ iShares ☐ Fixed Income ☐ Index and iShares ☐ Europe, the Middle East and Africa  (“EMEA”) ☐ Institutional ☐ Multi-asset ☐ Asia-Pacific ☐ Alternatives ☐ Cash Management Client Type Our organizational structure was designed to ensure that strong investment performance is our highest priority, and that we best align with our clients’ needs to capitalize on broader industry trends. Furthermore, our structure facilitates strong teamwork globally across both functions and regions in order to enhance our ability to leverage best practices to serve our clients and continue to develop our talent. Specifically, our investments functions are split into distinct strategies: Active Equity and Fixed Income, Beta, Multi-Asset, Alternatives and Trading/Liquidity. We serve a diverse mix of institutional and retail clients across the globe. Clients include tax-exempt institutions, such as defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans, charities, foundations and endowments; official institutions, such as central banks, sovereign wealth funds, supranationals and other government entities; taxable institutions, including insurance companies, financial institutions, corporations and third-party fund sponsors, and retail investors. iShares is presented as a separate client type below, with investments in iShares by institutions and retail clients excluded from figures and discussions in their respective sections below.

Retail investors are served principally through intermediaries, including broker-dealers, banks, trust companies, insurance companies and independent financial advisors. Clients invest primarily in mutual funds, which totaled $443.0 billion, or 82%, of retail long-term AUM at year-end, with the remainder invested in private investment funds and separately managed accounts (“SMAs”). 91% of long-term retail AUM is invested in active products, although this is impacted by iShares , which has a significant retail component, and is shown separately. Retail represented 12% of long-term AUM at December 31, 2016 and 34% of long-term base fees for 2016. 3 Component changes in retail long-term AUM for 201 6 are presented below.

Fixed income net inflows were diversified across exposures and products, with strong flows into our municipal, total return and high yield bond offerings. Equity net outflows of $1.1 billion were driven by outflows in U.S. equity funds, in what was a challenged year for the U.S. active mutual fund industry.  Multi-asset net outflows of $5.7 billion were primarily due to outflows from world allocation strategies. • International retail long-term net outflows of $6.0 billion were due to net outflows from equity, multi-asset and alternatives, partially offset by fixed income net inflows of $4.5 billion. Fixed income net inflows were led by emerging market and Asia debt offerings, as well as inflows into index fixed income mutual funds. Equity net outflows of $6.3 billion were primarily due to outflows from European and U.K. equities, with political and market uncertainty contributing to a risk-off environment in the region. Multi-asset net outflows of $3.7 billion reflected net outflows from world allocation strategies. iShares iShares is the leading ETF provider in the world, with $1.3 trillion of AUM at December 31, 2016 and was the top asset gatherer globally in 2016 1 with record net inflows of $140.5 billion resulting in an organic growth rate of 13%. Equity net inflows of $74.9 billion were driven by flows into the Core range and into funds with U.S. and broad developed market equity exposures. Record fixed income net inflows of $59.9 billion were diversified across exposures and product lines, led by flows into the Core range, corporate and high yield bond funds. iShares multi-asset and alternatives funds contributed a combined $5.7 billion of net inflows, primarily into commodities funds. iShares represented 27% of long-term AUM at December 31, 2016 and 36% of long-term base fees for 2016.

Institutional active represented 21% of long-term AUM and 20% of long-term base fees. Growth in AUM reflected continued strength in multi-asset products with net inflows of $13.3 billion reflecting ongoing demand for solutions offerings and the LifePath ® target-date suite. Our top-performing fixed income platform generated net inflows of $10.2 billion, diversified across exposures. Alternatives net inflows of $1.8 billion were led by inflows into infrastructure and alternatives solutions offerings. In addition, 2016 was another strong fundraising year for illiquid alternatives, and we raised $5.0 billion in new commitments, which will be a source of future net inflows. Equity net outflows of $7.4 billion reflected fundamental and scientific net outflows of $5.0 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively. Institutional index AUM totaled $1.9 trillion at December 31, 2016, reflecting net inflows of $33.5 billion. Fixed income net inflows of $41.4 billion were driven by demand for liability-driven investment solutions, particularly in Europe. Equity net outflows of $8.6 billion were primarily due to low-fee regional index equity outflows as clients looked to re-allocate, re-balance or meet their cash needs. Institutional index represented 40% of long-term AUM at December 31, 2016 and accounted for 10% of long-term base fees for 2016. The Company’s institutional clients consist of the following: • Pensions, Foundations and Endowments. BlackRock is among the world’s largest managers of pension plan assets with $1.989 trillion, or 68%, of long-term institutional AUM managed for defined benefit, defined contribution and other pension plans for corporations, governments and unions at December 31, 2016. The market landscape continues to shift from defined benefit to defined contribution, driving strong flows in our defined contribution channel, which had $18.5 billion of long-term net inflows for the year, driven by continued demand for our LifePath target-date suite. Defined contribution represented $703.5 billion of total pension AUM, and we remain well positioned to capitalize on the on-going evolution of the defined contribution market and demand for outcome-oriented investments. An additional $61.0 billion, or 2%, of long-term institutional AUM was managed for other tax-exempt investors, including charities, foundations and endowments. • Official Institutions. BlackRock manages $181.9 billion, or 6%, of long-term institutional AUM for official institutions, including central banks, sovereign wealth funds, supranationals, multilateral entities and government ministries and agencies at year-end 2016. These clients often require specialized investment advice, the use of customized benchmarks and training support.  Outflows from official institutions clients of $14.6 billion were primarily from index mandates, linked to clients’ asset allocation, re-balancing and cash needs. • Financial and Other Institutions. BlackRock is a top independent manager of assets for insurance companies, which accounted for $272.8 billion, or 10%, of institutional long-term AUM at year-end 2016. Long-term net inflows from insurance clients totaled $30.9 billion, driven by demand for highly customized solutions.  Assets managed for other taxable institutions, including corporations, banks and third-party fund sponsors for which we provide sub-advisory services, totaled $406.5 billion, or 14%, of long-term institutional AUM at year-end. 5 Product Type and investment style Component changes in AUM by product type and investment style for 2016 are presented below.

Long-term product offerings include active and index strategies. Our active strategies seek to earn attractive returns in excess of a market benchmark or performance hurdle while maintaining an appropriate risk profile. We offer two types of active strategies: those that rely primarily on fundamental research and those that utilize primarily quantitative models to drive portfolio construction. In contrast, index strategies seek to closely track the returns of a corresponding index, generally by investing in substantially the same underlying securities within the index or in a subset of those securities selected to approximate a similar risk and return profile of the index. Index strategies include both our non-ETF index products and iShares ETFs. Although many clients use both active and index strategies, the application of these strategies may differ. For example, clients may use index products to gain exposure to a market or asset class, or may use a combination of index strategies to target active returns. In addition, institutional non-ETF index assignments tend to be very large (multi-billion dollars) and typically reflect low fee rates. This has the potential to exaggerate the significance of net flows in institutional index products on BlackRock’s revenues and earnings. Equity Year-end 2016 equity AUM totaled $2.657 trillion, reflecting net inflows of $51.4 billion. Net inflows included $74.9 billion into iShares , driven by net inflows into the Core ranges and broad developed and emerging market equities. iShares net inflows were partially offset by active and non-ETF index net outflows of $20.2 billion and $3.3 billion, respectively. BlackRock’s effective fee rates fluctuate due to changes in AUM mix. Approximately half of BlackRock’s equity AUM is tied to international markets, including emerging markets, which tend to have higher fee rates than U.S. equity strategies. Accordingly, fluctuations in international equity markets, which may not consistently move in tandem with U.S. markets, have a greater impact on BlackRock’s effective equity fee rates and revenues. Fixed Income Fixed income AUM ended 2016 at $1.572 trillion, reflecting net inflows of $120.0 billion. In 2016, active net inflows of $16.6 billion were diversified across fixed income offerings, and included strong inflows from insurance clients. Fixed income iShares net inflows of $59.9 billion were led by flows into the Core ranges, emerging market, high yield and corporate bond funds.  Non-ETF index net inflows of $43.4 billion were driven by demand for liability-driven investment solutions. Multi-Asset BlackRock’s multi-asset team manages a variety of balanced funds and bespoke mandates for a diversified client base that leverages our broad investment expertise in global equities, bonds, currencies and commodities, and our extensive risk management capabilities. Investment solutions might include a combination of long-only portfolios and alternative investments as well as tactical asset allocation overlays.

Defined contribution plans of institutional clients remained a significant driver of flows, a nd contributed $11.3 billion to institutional multi-asset net inflows in 2016, primarily into target date and target risk product offerings. Retail net outflows of $9.4 billion were primarily due to outflows from world allocation strategies. The Company’s multi-asset strategies include the following: • Asset allocation and balanced products represented 45% of multi-asset AUM at year-end. These strategies combine equity, fixed income and alternative components for investors seeking a tailored solution relative to a specific benchmark and within a risk budget. In certain cases, these strategies seek to minimize downside risk through diversification, derivatives strategies and tactical asset allocation decisions. Flagship products in this category include our Global Allocation and Multi-Asset Income fund families. • Target date and target risk products grew 11% organically in 2016, with net inflows of $13.5 billion. Institutional investors represented 94% of target date and target risk AUM, with defined contribution plans accounting for 88% of AUM. Flows were driven by defined contribution investments in our LifePath and LifePath Retirement Income ® offerings. LifePath products utilize a proprietary asset allocation model that seeks to balance risk and return over an investment horizon based on the investor’s expected retirement timing. • Fiduciary management services are complex mandates in which pension plan sponsors or endowments and foundations retain BlackRock to assume responsibility for some or all aspects of plan management. These customized services require strong partnership with the clients’ investment staff and trustees in order to tailor investment strategies to meet client-specific risk budgets and return objectives. • FutureAdvisor is a digital wealth management platform, acquired by BlackRock in October 2015. FutureAdvisor operates as a service within BlackRock Solutions , providing financial institutions with technology-enabled advice capabilities to improve their clients’ investment experience. As consumers increasingly engage with technology to invest, BlackRock and FutureAdvisor are positioned to empower distribution partners to better serve their clients by combining FutureAdvisor’s technology-enabled advice with BlackRock’s multi-asset investment capabilities, proprietary technology and risk analytics. Alternatives BlackRock alternatives focus on sourcing and managing high-alpha investments with lower correlation to public markets and developing a holistic approach to address client needs in alternatives investing. Our alternatives products fall into two main categories — 1) core alternatives, and 2) currency and commodities. Core includes alternative solutions, direct hedge funds, hedge fund and private equity solutions (funds of funds), opportunistic private equity and credit, real estate and infrastructure offerings. BlackRock alternatives products are described below. In 2016, alternatives generated $5.0 billion of net inflows, driven by net inflows into currency and commodities and infrastructure.  BlackRock returned $6.1 billion of capital to investors upon the completion of investment periods, which is included in outflows. The largest contributors to return of capital were real estate and private equity solutions. In addition, we raised $5.0 billion of new commitments in 2016 across a variety of strategies, including private equity solutions, hedge fund solutions, opportunistic credit, alternative solutions, real estate and infrastructure. At year-end, we had $10.8 billion of non-fee paying, unfunded, uninvested commitments, which are expected to be deployed in future years; these commitments are not included in AUM or flows until they are invested.

In 2016, alternative solutions portfolios had $0.7 billion of net inflows. • Hedge Funds net outflows of $2.7 billion were due to net outflows of $2.8 billion from direct hedge funds, partially offset by $0.1 billion of net inflows in hedge fund solutions. Direct hedge fund AUM includes a variety of single- and multi-strategy offerings. • Illiquid and Opportunistic AUM included $12.0 billion in private equity solutions and $2.3 billion in opportunistic private equity and credit offerings. Net outflows of $0.4 billion were predominantly from private equity solutions. • Real Assets AUM, which includes infrastructure and real estate, totaled $24.4 billion, reflecting net inflows of $1.3 billion. Currency and Commodities The Company’s currency and commodities products include a range of active and passive products. Currency and commodities products had $6.1 billion of net inflows, primarily driven by iShares . Our iShares commodities products represented $18.8 billion of AUM and are not eligible for performance fees. Cash Management Cash management AUM totaled $403.6 billion at December 31, 2016. Cash management products include taxable and tax-exempt money market funds and customized separate accounts. Portfolios are denominated in U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars, Australian dollars, Euros, Swiss Francs or British pounds. We generated net inflows of $29.2 billion during 2016, primarily into government funds as clients shifted their cash allocations away from institutional prime and municipal funds ahead of U.S. money market reform. All BlackRock U.S. money market funds were brought into full compliance with new regulatory requirements in advance of the October 2016 implementation date. We actively repurposed and streamlined our U.S. product lineup to meet the new requirements and will continue to adapt our fund offerings to meet the needs of our clients.  In Europe, we continue to be a market leader highlighted by our implementation of the reverse distribution mechanism in our euro funds when faced with negative rates.  In April 2016, the Company completed a transaction with BofA Global Capital Management that transferred investment management responsibilities of $80.6 billion of cash assets under management to the Company.

BlackRock Solutions BlackRock Solutions (“BRS”) offers investment management technology systems, risk management services and advisory services on a fee basis. Aladdin is our proprietary technology platform, which serves as the investment and risk management system for both BlackRock and a growing number of sophisticated institutional investors around the world. BRS also offers comprehensive risk reporting capabilities via the Aladdin Risk offering; middle and back office outsourcing services; and investment accounting. BRS’ Financial Markets Advisory (“FMA”) group advises global financial institutions, regulators, and government entities across a range of risk, regulatory, capital markets and strategic services. BRS also offers a number of wealth management technology tools offering digital advice, portfolio construction capabilities and risk analytics for distributors including FutureAdvisor, a digital wealth management platform that provides financial institutions with technology-enabled advice capabilities to improve their clients’ investment experience, Aladdin Portfolio Builder, which provides financial advisors with portfolio construction tools, and Aladdin Risk for Wealth Management, which provides intermediary partners with institutional-quality portfolio construction, modeling and risk analytics capabilities. BRS record revenues of $714 million were up 11% year-over-year. Aladdin , which represented 83% of BRS revenue for the year, continues to benefit from trends favoring global investment platform consolidation and multi-asset risk solutions. Aladdin assignments are typically long-term contracts that provide recurring revenue. Our FMA group continued to post solid revenues, with a strong focus on helping clients navigate and implement requirements for the evolving regulatory environment. Advisory AUM decreased to $2.8 billion, driven by $7.6 billion of planned client distributions reflecting our continued success in disposing of assets for clients at, or above, targeted levels. At year-end, BRS served clients, including banks, insurance companies, official institutions, pension funds, asset managers, retail distributors and other investors across North America, South America, Europe, Asia and Australia. Securities Lending Securities lending is managed by a dedicated team, supported by quantitative analysis, proprietary technology and disciplined risk management. BlackRock receives both cash (primarily for U.S. domiciled portfolios) and noncash collateral under securities lending arrangements. The cash management team invests the cash we receive as collateral for securities on loan in other portfolios. Fees for securities lending for U.S. domiciled portfolios can be structured as a share of earnings, or as a management fee based on a percentage of the value of the cash collateral or both. The value of the securities on loan and the revenue earned are captured in the corresponding asset class being managed. The value of the collateral is not included in AUM. 9 Outstanding loan balanc es end ed the year at approximately $ 222 billion, up from $ 218 billion at ye ar-end 201 5 . On average, l iability spreads were slightly lower compared to 2015 levels . BlackRock employs a conservative investment style for cash and securities lending collateral that emphasizes quality, liquidity and interest rate risk management. Disciplined risk management, including a rigorous credit surveillance process, is an integral part of the investment process. BlackRock’s Cash Management Credit Committee has established risk limits, such as aggregate issuer exposure limits and maturity limits, across many of the products BlackRock manages, including over all of its cash management products. In the ordinary course of our business, there may be instances when a portfolio may exceed an internal risk limit or when an internal risk limit may be changed. No such instances, individually or in the aggregate, have been material to the Company. To the extent that daily evaluation and reporting of the profile of the portfolios identify that a limit has been exceeded, the relevant portfolio will be adjusted. To the extent a portfolio manager would like to obtain a temporary waiver of a risk limit, the portfolio manager must obtain approval from the credit research team, which is independent from the cash management portfolio managers. While a risk limit may be waived temporarily, such waivers are infrequent. Risk & Quantitative Analysis Across all asset classes, in addition to the efforts of the portfolio management teams, the Risk & Quantitative Analysis (“RQA”) group at BlackRock draws on extensive analytical systems and proprietary and third-party data to identify, measure and manage a wide range of risks. RQA provides risk management advice and independent risk oversight of the investment management processes, identifies and helps manage counterparty and operational risks, coordinates standards for firm wide investment performance measurement and determines risk management-related analytical and information requirements. Where appropriate, RQA will work with portfolio managers and developers to facilitate the development or improvement of risk models and analytics. COMPETITION BlackRock competes with investment management firms, mutual fund complexes, insurance companies, banks, brokerage firms and other financial institutions that offer products that are similar to, or alternatives to, those offered by BlackRock. In order to grow its business, BlackRock must be able to compete effectively for AUM. Key competitive factors include investment performance track records, the efficient delivery of beta for index products, investment style and discipline, client service and brand name recognition. Historically, the Company has competed principally on the basis of its long-term investment performance track record, its investment process, its risk management and analytic capabilities and the quality of its client service. Geographic Information At December 31, 2016, BlackRock served clients in more than 100 countries across the globe, including the United States, the United Kingdom and Japan. See Note 23, Segment Information , contained in Part II, Item 8 of this filing for more information. Employees At December 31, 2016, BlackRock had a total of approximately 13,000 employees, including approximately 6,300 located in offices outside the United States. REGULATION Virtually all aspects of BlackRock’s business are subject to various laws and regulations around the world, some of which are summarized below. These laws and regulations are primarily intended to protect investment advisory clients, investors in registered and unregistered investment companies, trust clients of BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (“BTC”), PNC and its bank subsidiaries and their customers and the financial system. Under these laws and regulations, agencies that regulate investment advisers, investment funds and bank holding companies and other individuals and entities have broad administrative powers, including the power to limit, restrict or prohibit the regulated entity or person from carrying on business if it fails to comply with such laws and regulations. Possible sanctions for significant compliance failures include the suspension of individual employees, limitations on engaging in certain lines of business for specified periods of time, revocation of investment adviser and other registrations or bank charters, censures and fines both for individuals and BlackRock. The rules governing the regulation of financial institutions and their holding companies and subsidiaries are very detailed and technical. Accordingly, the discussion below is general in nature, does not purport to be complete and is current only as of the date of this report. GLOBAL REGULATORY REFORM BlackRock is subject to numerous regulatory reform initiatives around the world. Any such initiative, or any new laws or regulations or changes to, or in the enforcement of, existing laws or regulations, could materially and adversely impact the scope or profitability of BlackRock’s business activities, lead to business disruptions, require BlackRock to alter its business or operating activities and expose BlackRock to additional costs (including compliance and legal costs) as well as reputational harm. BlackRock’s profitability also could be materially and adversely affected by modification of the rules and regulations that impact the business and financial communities in general, including changes to the laws governing banking, taxation, antitrust regulation and electronic commerce. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank”) was signed into law in the United States.  Dodd-Frank is expansive in scope and requires the adoption of extensive regulations and numerous regulatory decisions, many of which have been adopted. BlackRock has commenced a conformance program to address certain regulations adopted under Dodd-Frank, as well as financial reforms that have been introduced as part of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (“SEC”) investment company modernization initiatives.  The cost of these conformance activities has been absorbed by BlackRock; however, as the full extent of Dodd-Frank and other 10 rules will only become evident over time, it is not yet possible to predict the ultimate effects that Dodd-Frank, or subsequent implementing regulations and decisions, will have upon BlackRock’s bu siness, financial condition, and operating activities. Systemically Important Financial Institution (“SIFI”) Review Both the Financial Stability Board (“FSB”) working with the International Organization of Securities Commissions (“IOSCO”) and the Financial Stability Oversight Council (“FSOC”) are considering potential systemic risk related to asset management.  Statements made by these organizations have generally indicated that they are, at this time, focused on a products and activities, rather than designation, approach in their review of asset managers. This sentiment was most recently reiterated in the FSB’s final Policy Recommendations to Address Structural Vulnerabilities from Asset Management Activities, released in January 2017, which continues to concentrate primarily on products and activities and includes 14 recommendations largely focused on liquidity in open-end funds, leverage in funds, operational risk, and securities lending, certain of which IOSCO is expected to engage on in the future. The FSB has indicated that it may develop criteria for designation of nonbank non-insurers in the future to address “residual risks”.   Any measures applied in relation to a global systemically important financial institution (“G-SIFI”) designation from the FSB would need to be implemented through existing regulatory processes and procedures by relevant national authorities.  In the United States, the FSOC has not indicated whether or not it intends to designate any asset managers as SIFIs.  In the event that BlackRock receives a SIFI designation, under Dodd-Frank, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”) is charged with establishing enhanced regulatory requirements for nonbank financial institutions and BlackRock could become subject to direct supervision by the Federal Reserve. SEC Rulemakings for U.S. Registered Funds and Investment Advisers BlackRock’s business may also be impacted by SEC regulatory initiatives. The SEC and its staff continue to engage in various initiatives and reviews that seek to improve and modernize the regulatory structure governing the asset management industry, and registered investment companies in particular. In so doing, it has introduced rules that include (i) new monthly and annual reporting requirements for certain U.S. registered funds; (ii) enhanced reporting regimes for investments advisers; and (iii) the implementation of fund board approved liquidity risk management programs for ETFs and open-end funds, other than money market funds. The new rules will increase BlackRock’s public reporting and disclosure requirements, which could be costly. The SEC has also proposed rules requiring all advisers to implement enhanced business continuity and transition plans, as well as more stringent asset segregation rules and leverage limits for U.S. registered funds, which may require funds holding derivatives to hold more cash, which, in turn, could cause performance drag and increase tracking error. In addition, the SEC has indicated an intention to propose new rules for the stress testing of registered investment companies and transition planning by asset managers, including the transfer of client assets.  While these proposals have yet to be finalized into new rules, any new rules, guidance or regulatory initiatives resulting from these efforts could expose BlackRock to additional compliance costs and may require the Company to change how it operates its business and/or manages its funds. Regulation of Swaps and Derivatives The SEC, the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission each continue to review practices and regulations relating to the use of futures, swaps and other derivatives.  Such reviews could result in regulations that restrict or limit the use of such products by funds or accounts. If adopted, these limitations could require BlackRock to change certain business practices or implement new reporting or compliance processes, which could result in additional costs and/or restrictions. In December 2015, the SEC proposed a new rule governing the use of derivatives and other financial commitment transactions by investment companies that, if enacted, would represent a fundamental change in the nature of the SEC's regulations governing the use of derivatives and other financial commitment transactions by investment companies. This proposal has the potential to require BlackRock to change or restrict certain investment strategies or practices for some investment companies and incur additional costs. In some circumstances the proposed rule could make certain products less competitive with other investment options in the marketplace, which could negatively impact AUM. Further, the full implementation of regulations under Dodd-Frank and similar regulations in the European Union (“EU”) and other global jurisdictions relating to regulation of swaps and derivatives could impact the manner in which BlackRock-advised funds and accounts use and trade swaps and other derivatives, increasing the costs of derivatives trading for BlackRock’s clients. Jurisdictions outside the U.S. or EU in which BlackRock operates also have adopted and implemented, or are in the process of considering, adopting or implementing more pervasive regulation of many elements of the financial services industry, which could further impact BlackRock and the broader markets. For example, various global rules and regulations applicable to the use of financial products by funds, accounts and counterparties that have been adopted or proposed will require BlackRock to build and implement new compliance monitoring procedures to address the enhanced level of oversight to which it and its clients will be subject. These rules introduce new requirements such as mandatory central clearing of certain swaps transactions, requiring execution of certain swaps transactions on or through registered electronic trading venues (as opposed to over the phone or other execution methods), reporting transactions to central data repositories, mandating certain documentation standards, requiring the posting and collection of initial and/or variation margin for bilateral swap transactions and subjecting certain types of listed and/or over-the-counter transactions to position limit or position reporting requirements. In the United States, certain interest rate swaps and certain index credit default swaps are subject to Dodd-Frank central clearing and electronic trading venue requirements, with additional products and asset classes potentially becoming subject to these requirements in the future.  In the EU, central clearing requirements for certain swap transactions have become effective for certain types of BlackRock funds and accounts and will continue to be phased in for other types of BlackRock funds and accounts over the course of 2017 and beyond.  On March 1, 2017 most derivatives transactions that are not centrally cleared, including non-deliverable foreign exchange forward transactions and currency option transactions, will become subject to requirements in the United States, EU and numerous other jurisdictions to post or collect mark-to-market margin payments.  These rules have the potential to increase the complexity and cost of trading non-cleared derivatives for BlackRock's clients. The new rules and regulations may produce regulatory inconsistencies in global derivatives trading rules and increase BlackRock’s operational and legal risks. 11 Regulation of Exchange Traded Funds As a result of market volatility, regulators globally are examining the potential risks in ETFs, including those related to transparency, liquidity and structural resiliency. BlackRock and other large issuers of ETFs are working with market participants and regulators to address certain of these issues but there can be no assurance that structural or regulatory reforms will be implemented in a manner favorable to BlackRock, or at all.  Depending on the outcome of this renewed regulatory analysis, or any associated structural reforms, ETF products may become subject to increased regulatory scrutiny or restrictions, which may require BlackRock to incur additional compliance and reporting expenses and adversely affect the Company’s business. Taxation BlackRock’s businesses may be directly or indirectly affected by new tax legislation and regulation, or the modification of existing tax laws by U.S. or non-U.S. authorities. In particular, a number of proposals for broad tax reform of the corporate tax system in the United States are under evaluation by various legislative bodies, but it is not possible to determine accurately the overall impact of such proposals at this time. Similarly, the Company manages assets that have investment objectives which conform to specific tax law rules, which could be impacted by changes in tax law or policy, particularly with respect to investment income. For example, BlackRock may be impacted by the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (“FATCA”) and the Common Reporting Standard (“CRS”) which have introduced new investor onboarding, withholding and reporting rules aimed at ensuring persons with financial assets outside of their tax residence country pay appropriate taxes. FATCA and CRS rules impact both U.S. and non-U.S. funds and subject BlackRock to additional administrative burdens and reporting obligations. In many instances, bilateral Intergovernmental Agreements between the United States and the countries in which BlackRock does business will govern implementation of the new rules. While many of these bilateral Intergovernmental Agreements have been put into place, others have yet to be concluded. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) has also launched a base erosion and profit shifting (“BEPS”) proposal that aims to rationalize tax treatment across jurisdictions. In October 2015, the OECD released its final BEPS package in an effort to curb the use of certain tax regimes and elements of tax planning, primarily in a cross-border context. The final package was endorsed by the G20 and is subject to implementation. As it stands, BEPS contains a number of provisions that would result in increased taxation for cross-border funds, particularly affecting fund raising for high alpha alternative products in Europe, such as private debt and equity. In addition, in July 2016, the European Council formally adopted the Anti-Tax Avoidance Package, which contains measures to regulate certain elements of tax planning and to boost tax transparency. The BEPS package and the Anti-Tax Avoidance Package could curtail the amount of investments channeled by, and have unintended taxation consequences for, funds as well as BlackRock’s overall tax position, which could adversely affect BlackRock’s financial condition and that of its clients. In addition, certain EU Member States, such as France and Italy, have enacted financial transaction taxes (“FTTs”) which impose taxation on a broad range of financial instruments and derivatives transactions. Several other Member States continue to discuss introducing FTTs. In general, any tax on securities and derivatives transactions would impact investors and would likely have a negative impact on the liquidity of the securities and derivatives markets, could diminish the attractiveness of certain types of products that BlackRock manages in those countries and could cause clients to shift assets away from such products. An FTT could significantly increase the operational costs of BlackRock entering into, on behalf of its clients, securities and derivatives transactions that would be subjected to an FTT, which could adversely impact BlackRock’s financial results and clients’ performance results. Lastly, the application of tax regulations involves numerous uncertainties and, in the normal course of business, U.S. and non-U.S. tax authorities may review and challenge tax positions adopted by BlackRock. These challenges may result in adjustments to, or impact the timing or amount of taxable income, deductions or other tax allocations, which may adversely affect BlackRock’s effective tax rate and overall financial condition. Volcker Rule Provisions of Dodd-Frank referred to as the “Volcker Rule” created a new section of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (the “Bank Holding Company Act”) that places limitations on the ability of banks and their subsidiaries to engage in proprietary trading and to invest in and transact with certain private investment funds, including hedge funds, private equity funds and funds of funds (collectively “covered funds”). The Bank Holding Company Act by its terms does not currently apply to BlackRock. The Federal Reserve currently takes the position that PNC’s ownership interest in BlackRock, which is approximately 22%, causes BlackRock to be treated as a nonbank subsidiary of PNC for the purpose of the Bank Holding Company Act and that BlackRock is subject to banking regulation. Based on this interpretation of the Bank Holding Company Act, the Federal Reserve could initiate a process to formally determine that PNC controls BlackRock under the terms of the Bank Holding Company Act. Any such determination, if successful, would subject BlackRock to current and future regulatory requirements under the Bank Holding Company Act, including the Volcker Rule. Conformance with the Volcker Rule may require BlackRock to remove its name from the names of its covered funds, and to sell certain seed and co-investments that it holds in those funds, which may occur at a discount to existing carrying value depending on market conditions. Revised Department of Labor (“DoL”) Fiduciary Rule In April 2016, the DoL proposed a new regulation defining the term "fiduciary" for purposes of the fiduciary responsibility provisions of Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”) and the prohibited transaction exercise tax provisions of the IRS. The rule is scheduled to begin to apply in April 2017. The rule would require BlackRock to revise a number of its distribution relationships, create compliance and operational challenges for BlackRock’s distribution partners and may limit BlackRock’s ability to provide certain useful services and education to its clients. On February 3, 2017, a presidential memorandum directed the DoL to examine the Fiduciary Rule’s impact and to prepare an updated economic and legal analysis of the rule (the “DoL Memorandum”), which could include proposing rules to revise or rescind the Fiduciary Rule. On the same day, the DoL issued a statement that it would consider its legal options to delay the applicability date of the Fiduciary Rule as it complies with the DoL Memorandum. 12 Financial Crimes Enforcement Network Proposed Rulemaking for Registered Investment Advisers The Financial Crime Enforcement Network has issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (“Proposed Rule”) that would extend to a number of BlackRock’s subsidiaries, which are registered or required to be registered with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the “Advisers Act”), the requirement to establish anti-money laundering programs and report suspicious activity to the Financial Crime Enforcement Network under the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 (the “Bank Secrecy Act”).  The Proposed Rule would extend to those BlackRock subsidiaries captured within the Bank Secrecy Act’s definition of “financial institutions”, which would require them to comply with the Bank Secrecy Act reporting and recordkeeping requirements.  If enacted in its current form, the Proposed Rule would expose BlackRock to additional compliance costs. U.S. Executive Order On February 3, 2017, a U.S. presidential executive order (the “Executive Order”) articulated certain core principles for regulating the U.S. financial system and directed the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury to report to the President within 120 days on the extent to which existing laws, treaties, rules, regulations and policies promote, support or inhibit the federal regulation of the U.S. financial system in a manner consistent with the core principles. BlackRock will continue to monitor the potential impact of the Executive Order on its business. British Exit from the European Union In June 2016, the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the European Union (“EU”), commonly referred to as "Brexit", which resulted in significant volatility in several international markets. The timing and the outcome of the negotiations between the U.K. and the EU in connection with Brexit are highly uncertain and information regarding the long-term consequences of the vote is expected to become clearer over time. The Company will continue to monitor the potential impact of Brexit on its results of operations and financial condition. Markets in Financial Instruments Directives BlackRock is also subject to numerous regulatory reform initiatives in Europe.  For example, in the EU rules and regulations made under the current Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (“MiFID”) regime (described more particularly under “— European Regulation” below) are in the process of being revised through implementation of the “MiFID II” package of measures made up of a recast Directive and a new Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation.  MiFID II, which is scheduled to come into effect in January 2018, will be implemented through a number of Implementing and Regulatory Technical Standards to be made through Delegated Acts made by the European Commission following advice from the European Securities and Markets Authority. MiFID II will build upon many of the measures introduced by MiFID, and will extend investor protection, trading transparency, clearing and trading venue access and reporting requirements. It is expected that MiFID II will have significant and wide-ranging impacts on EU securities and derivatives markets. In particular, there will be (i) enhanced governance and investor protection standards, (ii) prescriptive rules on portfolio management firms’ ability to receive and pay for investment research relating to all asset classes, (iii) enhanced regulation of algorithmic trading, (iv) the movement of trading in certain shares and derivatives on to regulated execution venues, (v) the extension of pre- and post-trade transparency requirements to wider categories of financial instruments, (vi) restrictions on the use of so-called dark pool trading, (vii) the creation of a new type of trading venue called the Organized Trading Facility for non-equity financial instruments, (viii) new commodity derivative position limits and reporting requirements, (ix) a move away from vertical silos in execution, clearing and settlement, (x) an enhanced role for the European Securities and Markets Authority in supervising EU securities and derivatives markets and (xi) new requirements regarding non-EU investment firms’ access to EU financial markets. Implementation of these measures will have direct and indirect impacts on BlackRock and its subsidiaries and may require significant changes to client servicing models.  A significant number of the impacts are yet to be determined because MiFID II contains a wide ranging and complex set of measures. The broad nature of the MiFID II reforms may impact BlackRock’s distribution client servicing and distribution models, in particular affecting the fees BlackRock is able to charge to its clients and the commissions it is able to pay to its distribution partners. Market structure reforms may also impact the way that the Company executes investment decisions for client portfolios and have an impact on general market liquidity. Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities The EU has also adopted directives on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (“UCITS”). The latest initiative in this area, UCITS V, seeks to align the UCITS depositary regime, UCITS remuneration rules and regulators’ power to sanction for breaches of the UCITS Directive with the requirements of the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive. UCITS V came into effect in March 2016 with further implementing measures commencing in October 2016. Compliance with the updated UCITS directive will subject BlackRock to additional expenses associated with new depositary oversight and other organizational requirements. Reform of European Retail Distribution BlackRock must also comply with retail distribution rules aimed at enhancing consumer protections, overhauling mutual fund fee structures by banning the payment of commissions to distributors and increasing professionalism in the retail investment sector. The rules were originally introduced in the U.K. in 2012 and similar rules have since been introduced in other jurisdictions where BlackRock operates such as the Netherlands, and are under discussion elsewhere. Similarly, MiFID II will contain a ban on certain advisers recovering commissions and other nonmonetary benefits from fund managers. These rules will lead to greater fragmentation of distribution rules and may lead to changes to BlackRock’s client servicing and distribution models, in particular affecting the fees BlackRock is able to charge to its clients and the commissions it is able to pay to its distribution partners. EU Benchmarks Regulation Political agreement on the EU Benchmarks Regulation was reached at the end of 2015. The Regulation provides the legislative framework to implement the 2013 International Organization of Securities Commissions Principles for Financial Benchmarks.  The scope of the Regulation is broad as it includes submission-based benchmarks through to transaction-based market indices. Proportionality is applied to create a stricter framework for the systemically relevant benchmarks such as the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and the Euro Interbank Offered Rate 13 (EURIBOR). Although the Regulation creates a number of ob ligations on administrators of, and submitters to, benchmarks, it is less extensive with respect to obligations of users of benchmarks, such as asset managers. The Regulation formalizes due diligence procedures for users and imposes other additional admini strative requirements of users of third-party benchmarks. Managers using third-party and/or bespoke benchmarks to assess fund performance are also subject to the Regulation. The Regulation comes into effect in January 2018; detailed technical standards are expected to be published this year. The Regulation will impose additional administrative and due diligence requirements on the Company, the burden of which is likely to increase as BlackRock makes additional enhancements to its indexing business. Revised EU Capital Requirements EU regulators are considering how to design an appropriate capital regime for non-systemically important investment firms given that the current EU regime, which is based upon banking requirements, is not adapted for asset managers. The European Commission is currently expected to publish a number of proposals at the end of this year following consideration of a European Banking Authority final report on a suitable regulatory capital framework. Once implemented, any new requirements could result in significant changes to the regulatory capital that BlackRock is required to hold in the EU. EU Money Market Fund Reform The EU council has recently announced political agreement with the European Parliament on certain money market funds reforms that are intended to reduce perceived risks associated with these products. The reforms are expected to come into effect starting in 2018. Although technical details are still to be finalized, the reforms will limit the use of constant net asset value money market funds to those holding only government debt, and introduce a new category of “low volatility net asset value” money market funds, with both categories of money market funds being subject to reinforced liquidity requirements as well as safeguards such as liquidity fees and redemption gates. They may also reduce the attractiveness of certain money market funds to investors. BlackRock is evaluating the reforms and potential impact to its existing constant net asset value money market funds. Revised Retail Consumer Disclosure Requirements EU legislators have introduced a new “Key Information Document” (“KID”), which is applicable where a retail consumer is sold certain investment products. The KID must include specific information on costs, risks and performance. BlackRock will be required to produce a KID for each fund in scope, as well as to make information available to distribution partners who sell these funds in the EU. Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) Asset Management Market Survey The FCA is conducting a market study of the asset management sector with a focus on understanding whether competition effectively enables institutional and retail investors to obtain value when purchasing asset management services. In November 2016, the FCA issued an Interim Report which raised concerns about the effectiveness and sufficiency of price competition in driving value for investors within the asset management sector. The Interim Report contained a number of proposed remedies to address these issues and invited further comment from the industry. The FCA intends to finalize its review in the second quarter of this year and, if it concludes that competition requires enhancement, it may introduce rules, publish general guidance, propose enhanced industry self-regulation or institute firm-specific remedies, including enforcement. EXISTING U.S. REGULATION - OVERVIEW BlackRock and certain of its U.S. subsidiaries are currently subject to extensive regulation, primarily at the federal level, by the SEC, the DoL, the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”), the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”), the National Futures Association (“NFA”), the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and other federal government agencies and regulatory bodies. Certain of BlackRock’s U.S. subsidiaries are also subject to various anti-terrorist financing, privacy, anti-money laundering regulations and economic sanctions laws and regulations established by various agencies. The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the “Advisers Act”) imposes numerous obligations on registered investment advisers such as BlackRock, including record-keeping, operational and marketing requirements, disclosure obligations and prohibitions on fraudulent activities. State level regulation of certain BlackRock activities also exists through Attorneys General, Insurance Commissioners and other state level agencies. The Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “Investment Company Act”) imposes stringent governance, compliance, operational, disclosure and related obligations on registered investment companies and their investment advisers and distributors, such as BlackRock and its affiliated companies. The SEC is authorized to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of the Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, ranging from fines and censure to termination of an investment adviser’s registration. Investment advisers also are subject to certain state securities laws and regulations. Non-compliance with the Advisers Act, the Investment Company Act or other federal and state securities laws and regulations could result in investigations, sanctions, disgorgement, fines and reputational damage. BlackRock’s trading and investment activities for client accounts are regulated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), as well as the rules of various securities exchanges and self-regulatory organizations, including laws governing trading on inside information, market manipulation and a broad number of technical requirements (e.g., short sale limits, volume limitations and reporting obligations) and market regulation policies. Violation of any of these laws and regulations could result in fines or sanctions, as well as restrictions on BlackRock’s activities and damage to its reputation. Furthermore, one of BlackRock’s subsidiaries, BTC, was required to register as a municipal advisor (as that term is defined in the statute) with the SEC and Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (“MSRB”) as a result of SEC rules giving effect to a section of Dodd-Frank requiring such registration. The rules subject BTC to new and additional regulation by the SEC and Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board. 14 BlackRock manages a variety of private pools of capital, including hedge funds, funds of hedge funds, private equity funds, collateralized debt obligations, collateralized loan obligations (“CLOs”), real estate funds, collective investment trusts, managed futures funds and hybrid funds. Congress, regulators, tax authorities and others continue to explore, on their own and in response to demands from the investment community and t he public, increased regulation related to private pools of capital, including changes with respect to investor eligibility, certain limitations on trading activities, record-keeping and reporting, the scope of anti-fraud protections, safekeeping of client assets and a variety of other matters. BlackRock may be materially and adversely affected by new legislation, rule-making or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing rules and regulations imposed by various regulators in this area. Certain BlackRock subsidiaries are subject to ERISA, and to regulations promulgated thereunder by the DoL, insofar as they act as a “fiduciary” under Title I of ERISA with respect to benefit plan clients. ERISA and applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries under ERISA, prohibit certain transactions involving ERISA plan clients and impose excise taxes for violations of these prohibitions, mandate certain required periodic reporting and disclosures and require certain BlackRock entities to carry bonds insuring against losses caused by fraud or dishonesty. ERISA also imposes additional compliance, reporting and operational requirements on BlackRock that otherwise are not applicable to non-benefit plan clients. BlackRock has seven subsidiaries that are registered as commodity pool operators (“CPOs”) and/or commodity trading advisors (“CTAs”) with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and are members of the NFA. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission and NFA each administer a comparable regulatory system covering futures contracts and various other financial instruments, including swaps as a result of Dodd-Frank, in which certain BlackRock clients may invest. Two of BlackRock’s other subsidiaries, BlackRock Investments, LLC (“BRIL”) and BlackRock Execution Services, are registered with the SEC as broker-dealers and are member-firms of FINRA. Each broker-dealer has a membership agreement with FINRA that limits the scope of such broker-dealer’s permitted activities. BRIL is also an approved person with the New York Stock Exchange and a member of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, subject to Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board rules. U.S. Banking Regulation PNC is a bank holding company and regulated as a “financial holding company” by the Federal Reserve under the Bank Holding Company Act. The supervision and regulation of PNC and its subsidiaries under applicable banking laws are intended primarily for the protection of its banking subsidiaries, its depositors, the Deposit Insurance Fund of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the financial system as a whole, rather than for the protection of stockholders, creditors or clients of BlackRock. As described in “Item 1-Business”, as of December 31, 2016 PNC owned approximately 22% of BlackRock’s capital stock, which may subject BlackRock to banking regulation as a nonbank subsidiary of PNC. The Bank Holding Company Act by its terms does not currently apply to BlackRock. The Federal Reserve currently takes the position that this ownership interest causes BlackRock to be treated as a nonbank subsidiary of PNC for the purpose of the Bank Holding Company Act and that BlackRock is subject to banking regulation. Based on this interpretation of the Bank Holding Company Act, the Federal Reserve could initiate a process to formally determine that PNC controls BlackRock under the terms of the Bank Holding Company Act.  Any such determination, if successful, would subject BlackRock to current and future regulatory requirements under the Bank Holding Company Act, including the Volcker Rule, that are more restrictive than those the Company is subject to under other applicable laws, as well as the enforcement authority of the Federal Reserve, which includes the power to impose substantial fines and other penalties for violations. Any effort by BlackRock to contest a control determination by the Federal Reserve may be costly and complex, and may not result in a reversal of such determination. Any failure of PNC to maintain its status as a financial holding company could result in substantial limitations on certain BlackRock activities and its growth. Such a change of status could be caused by any failure of PNC or one of PNC’s bank subsidiaries to remain “well capitalized” and “well managed,” by any examination downgrade of one of PNC’s bank subsidiaries, or by any failure of one of PNC’s bank subsidiaries to maintain a satisfactory rating under the Community Reinvestment Act. One of BlackRock’s subsidiaries, BTC, is organized as a limited purpose national trust company that does not accept deposits or make commercial loans. BTC is a member of the Federal Reserve System. Accordingly, BTC is examined and supervised by the OCC and is subject to various banking laws and regulations enforced by the OCC, such as laws and regulations governing capital adequacy, fiduciary activities, conflicts of interest, self-dealing, and the prevention of financial crime, including money laundering. BTC is also subject to various Federal Reserve regulations applicable to member institutions, such as regulations restricting transactions with affiliates. Many of these laws and regulations are meant for the protection of BTC’s customers and not BTC, BlackRock and its affiliates, or BlackRock’s stockholders. Regulation of Securities Lending Financing Transactions In its 2014 Annual Report, the Financial Stability Oversight Council identified securities lending indemnification by asset managers who act as lending agents as a potential systemic risk that required further review and monitoring. The Federal Reserve is also considering whether to impose specific margin or minimum haircut requirements for securities financing transactions. In addition, in November 2015, the EU introduced a new regulation on the reporting and transparency of securities financing transactions and total return swaps (“SFTR”). The SFTR aims to improve the transparency surrounding securities financing transactions and total return swaps by, among other things, requiring reporting of securities financing transactions and total return swaps to a trade repository and requiring disclosure of the use of securities financing transactions and total return swaps to investors. If the recent scrutiny of securities financing transactions results in further regulatory requirements or reporting obligations, BlackRock may be required to introduce further compliance measures, which will subject BlackRock to additional expenses and could lead to modifications in BlackRock’s securities financing transaction activities, including potential adjustments to its activities as agent lender for its clients. 15 Regulation of Money Market Funds In October 2016, new rules were implemented to reform the regulatory structure governing U.S. money market funds to address the perceived systemic risks of money market funds. The new rules require institutional prime and institutional municipal money market funds to employ a floating net asset value per share method of pricing, which allows the daily share prices of these funds to fluctuate along with changes in the market-based value of fund assets. Retail money market funds continue operating with a constant net asset value per share.  The rules, however, provide for new tools for institutional and retail money market funds’ boards designed to address market shocks, including the ability to impose liquidity fees and redemption gates under certain circumstances.  The new rules led to an approximately $1 trillion asset transition from the prime money funds industry to the government money funds industry and BlackRock saw a similar dynamic on its platform. EXISTING INTERNATIONAL REGULATION — OVERVIEW BlackRock’s international operations are subject to the laws and regulations of a number of international jurisdictions, as well as oversight by numerous regulatory agencies and bodies in those jurisdictions. In some instances, these operations are also affected by U.S. laws and regulations that have extra-territorial application. Below is a summary of certain international regulatory standards to which BlackRock is subject. It is not meant to be comprehensive as there are parallel legal and regulatory arrangements in force in many jurisdictions where BlackRock’s subsidiaries conduct business. Of note among the various other international regulations to which BlackRock is subject, are the extensive and complex regulatory reporting requirements that necessitate the monitoring and reporting of issuer exposure levels (thresholds) across the holdings of managed funds and accounts and those of the Company. European Regulation The Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) currently regulates certain BlackRock subsidiaries in the U.K. It also regulates those U.K. subsidiaries’ branches established in other EU countries and the U.K. branches of certain of BlackRock’s U.S. subsidiaries. In addition, the Prudential Regulation Authority (“PRA”) regulates one BlackRock U.K. insurance subsidiary. Authorization by the FCA and (where relevant) the PRA is required to conduct certain financial services related business in the U.K. under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”). The FCA’s rules adopted under the FSMA govern the majority of a firm’s capital resources requirements, senior management arrangements, conduct of business, interaction with clients, and systems and controls, whereas the rules of the PRA focus solely on the prudential requirements that apply to BlackRock’s U.K.-regulated insurance subsidiary. The FCA supervises BlackRock’s U.K.-regulated subsidiaries through a combination of proactive engagement, event-driven and reactive supervision and theme based reviews in order to monitor BlackRock’s compliance with regulatory requirements. Breaches of the FCA’s rules may result in a wide range of disciplinary actions against BlackRock’s U.K.-regulated subsidiaries and/or its employees. In addition, BlackRock’s U.K.-regulated subsidiaries and other European subsidiaries and branches must comply with the pan-European regulatory regime established by MiFID, which regulates the provision of investment services and activities throughout the EU. MiFID, the scope of which is being enhanced through MiFID II (which is described more particularly under “— Global Regulatory Reform” above), sets out detailed requirements governing the organization and conduct of business of investment firms and regulated markets. It also includes pre- and post-trade transparency requirements for equity and non-equity markets and extensive transaction reporting requirements. Certain BlackRock European subsidiaries must also comply with the Consolidated Life Directive and Insurance Mediation Directive. In addition, relevant entities must comply with revised obligations on capital resources for banks and certain investment firms (the Capital Requirements Directive and Capital Requirements Regulation). These include requirements on capital, as well as matters of governance and remuneration. Relevant BlackRock entities must also comply with the requirements of the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive, which imposes obligations on the authorization and capital, conduct of business, organization, transparency and marketing of alternative investment funds that are sold in, or marketed to, the EU. The obligations introduced through these regulations and directives will have a direct effect on some of BlackRock’s European operations. BlackRock’s EU-regulated subsidiaries are also subject to an EU regulation on over-the-counter (“OTC”) derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories, which requires (i) the central clearing of standardized OTC derivatives, (ii) the application of risk-mitigation techniques to non-centrally cleared OTC derivatives and (iii) the reporting of all derivative contracts since February 2014. Regulation in the Asia-Pacific Region In Japan, a BlackRock subsidiary is subject to the Financial Instruments and Exchange Law (“FIEL”) and the Law Concerning Investment Trusts and Investment Corporations. These laws are administered and enforced by the Japanese Financial Services Agency (“JFSA”), which establishes standards for compliance, including capital adequacy and financial soundness requirements, customer protection requirements and conduct of business rules. The JFSA is empowered to conduct administrative proceedings that can result in censure, fines, the issuance of cease and desist orders or the suspension or revocation of registrations and licenses granted under the FIEL. This Japanese subsidiary also holds a license for real estate investment management and brokerage activities which subjects it to the regulations set forth in the Real Estate Brokerage Business Act. In Australia, BlackRock’s subsidiaries are subject to various Australian federal and state laws, and certain subsidiaries are regulated by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (“ASIC”). ASIC regulates companies and financial services in Australia and is responsible for promoting investor, creditor and consumer protection. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in the cancellation, suspension or variation of the regulated subsidiaries’ licenses in Australia. The activities of certain BlackRock subsidiaries in Hong Kong are subject to the Securities and Futures Ordinance (“SFO”), which governs the securities and futures markets and regulates, among others, offers of investments to the public and provides for the licensing of intermediaries. The SFO is administered by the Securities and Futures Commission (“SFC”). The SFC is also empowered to establish standards for compliance as well as codes and guidelines. The relevant BlackRock subsidiaries and the employees conducting any of the regulated activities specified in the SFO are required to be licensed with the SFC, and are subject to the rules, codes and guidelines issued by the SFC. Failure to 16 comply with the applicable laws, regulations, codes and guidelines issued by the SFC could result in the susp ension or revocations of the licenses granted by the SFC. BlackRock’s operations in Taiwan are regulated by the Taiwan Financial Supervisory Commission, which is responsible for regulating securities markets (including the Taiwan Stock Exchange and the Taiwan Futures Exchange), the banking industry and the insurance sector. Other financial regulators oversee BlackRock subsidiaries, branches, and representative offices across the Asia-Pacific region, including in Singapore and South Korea. Regulators in these jurisdictions have authority with respect to financial services including, among other things, the authority to grant or cancel required licenses or registrations. In addition, these regulators may subject certain BlackRock subsidiaries to net capital requirements.
