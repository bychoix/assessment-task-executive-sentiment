________________________________________________________________________
SUMMARY: On June 20, 2018 (83 FR 28710), the U.S. Trade Representative (Trade
Representative) provided notice of an initial action in the Section 301 investigation of the acts,
policies, and practices of the Government of China related to technology transfer, intellectual
property, and innovation. The initial action was the imposition of an additional 25 percent
ad valorem duty on products of China with an annual trade value of approximately $34 billion,
effective July 6, 2018. The June 20 notice also sought public comment on another proposed
action, in the form of an additional 25 percent ad valorem duty on products of China with an
annual trade value of approximately $16 billion. The public comment process in connection with
the proposed additional action is ongoing. On July 6, 2018, China responded to the initial action
by imposing increased duties on goods of the United States. In light of China’s decision to
respond to the investigation by imposing duties on U.S. goods, the Trade Representative
proposes a modification of the action taken in this investigation. The proposed modification is to
maintain the original $34 billion action and the proposed $16 billion action, and to take further
action in the form of an additional 10 percent ad valorem duty on products of China with an
2
annual trade value of approximately $200 billion. The products subject to this proposed
supplemental action are classified in the HTSUS subheadings set out in the Annex to this notice.
The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) is seeking public comment and will hold a
public hearing regarding this proposed modification of the action in the investigation.
