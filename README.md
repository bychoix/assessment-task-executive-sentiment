To gauge the sentiment of company executives for Task1, Shareholder Letters from the annual reports published by the companies as well as MD&A (Management’s Discussion and Analysis) from 10-Ks submitted to the SEC were used.  These sources were chosen as they are formally published by a team of executives of the firm on an annual basis and are expected to be scrutinized by the public as well as governmental regulators.  The data was scraped by accessing EDGAR (SEC) and annualreport.com using several python scripts found in the Github repo, CEO/China Sentiment Analysis-Task1: EDGAR.ipynb and CEO/China Sentiment Analysis-Task1: Annual Report.py.  While EDGAR has a public API, the annual reports needed to be downloaded through an actual browser using playwright.  The texts were then filtered for any mentions of the word “China” and the filtered texts were further fed into Gemini 3 for a short summary and sentiment analysis.  The final output is 125 rows of summarized commentary saved in *CEO Sentiment (Shareholder Letter, 10-K MD&A).xlsx*.
Regarding identifying the policies affecting the company for Task2, 10 policies have been handpicked based on media exposure, and saved in *Policy and Regulation (Official Documents from US and China).xlsx*.
